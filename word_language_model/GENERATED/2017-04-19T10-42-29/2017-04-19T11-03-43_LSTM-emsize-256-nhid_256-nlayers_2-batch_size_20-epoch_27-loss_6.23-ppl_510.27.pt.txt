 And pheromone hair and ears passed north, 
 And all was promising again again 
 As a warning would shine again through 
 The green bastions of the winter glade— 
 
 Heard the great crash at eve brought out well ashamed 
 By the beautiful stern hotels, the growing eyes 
 And brethren bursting over the ceiling. 
 
 It was beautiful and desperate, with its level breath, 
 The curd-pale water and the glare poseur, 
 Then the tramp
