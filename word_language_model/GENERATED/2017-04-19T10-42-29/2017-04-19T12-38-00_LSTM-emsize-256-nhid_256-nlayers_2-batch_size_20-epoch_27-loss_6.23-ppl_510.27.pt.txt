 
 The vulgar serenity 
 Pegasus as I tell you, 
 Or find their beauty in my life, 
 I swear it is Jeoffry—and them there 
 Being so much prettiest in a terrific world of anything! 
 
 I am delicate as the birds that never fade. 
 A continuous star with footprints on the lake 
 Empty clarities to the building 
 Rolling the hooded green essary 
 Looking down, -- the world dart out spacious, 
 Plod almost away, (Bouquet 
 Of wheat knit
