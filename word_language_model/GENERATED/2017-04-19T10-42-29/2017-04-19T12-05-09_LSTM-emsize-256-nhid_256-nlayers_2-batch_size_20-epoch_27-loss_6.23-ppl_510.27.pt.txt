My Milk. 

 They soon--Eugene dangerous trees that open 
 They have no knave they shall no longer tell. 
 
 And you must see me have one of them. 
 
 I hate all soaked with this sure of them 
 And numbed hands are not listening. 
 Some death glitters at dusk in storm, 
 Be prone with Abe ecstasy, 
 Carpenters will charm from place to draw. 
 
 So much of us expect the order possible 
 Of minutes!— fluent the House of fools.
