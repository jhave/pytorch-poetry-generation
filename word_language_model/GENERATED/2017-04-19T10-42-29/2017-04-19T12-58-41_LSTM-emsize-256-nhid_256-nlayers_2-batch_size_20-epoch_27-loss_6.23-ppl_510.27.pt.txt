 It is the time of nights 
 I add out 
 With his power R.I.S. 
 
 And 
 He does not know what I want to say 
 What his gender only will. 
 He worked for silence on a bed of afternoons 
 And Sorrowing, he looked at me. 
 
 Into the morning, he mutters 
 The hoarse trains and slippers down 
 In a feathered Puffs rules 
 With the protest, special— 
 Silently and allowed up to pry 
 Their heads on
