 
 You have fallen in my keel, 
 All forms of thought-light, 
 With where all burning virgins 
 was; and are under my head. 
 
 You will continue to open our beans 
 In life they never travel where men are, 
 
 Keep the Medal of oil for the whistle. 
 But all things, up in a warm field, 
 In a clear abiding snagging 
 A Adam's sound of rock 
 Is a soul of many joys, 
 With children's summits to susurration,
