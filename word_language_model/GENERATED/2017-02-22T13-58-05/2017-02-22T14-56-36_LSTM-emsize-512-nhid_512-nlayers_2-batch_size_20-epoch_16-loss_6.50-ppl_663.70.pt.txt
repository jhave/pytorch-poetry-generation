Never 

 has come to make a sign and its test 
 papers, clench down. 
 He, who hears wants 
 
 like a standpoint 
 before he goes on, 
 
 His nose-- rented 
 to a little. This instant the simplicity of degrees, 
 the laser cutter, flesh, in the garden 
 of the flames, the body's own life 
 even to nothing, that wind 
 is the seventh thing that winter goes 
 hunting yet looking back at us 
 inside the hollow naked earth,
