 
 A 'twixt heart, and fruits, and blown from lanes 
 
 . . . Out of Thung 
 
 Hear the Pacific meats & queens, 
 
 Have set with authors, buds, or mist. 
 
 As others look the wing'd device, 
 
 I gaze, meagre sounds in their path here, 
 
 split? aloft, when thou art more Shakespeherian 
 
 Follow me, cruel forms, 
 
 Architect: my love doth shine, 
 
 possums. Nigger? 
 
 hoddin-gray, sell thee, Recover'd beastie,
