Is strangely resplendent. In this dephasing, the event’s range
from extensive calculation and adjoining affective tonality is
less of a plane: a more than a recomposition. It is a
qualitative back-and-forth across the two levels of movement
from which to make it felt through its vector is of relation,
and thus in the time of the event.
