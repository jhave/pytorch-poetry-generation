    The refrain of the virtual—that it is always is but always
more than one. It is not in the same place that the body can be
but less of the midst, than it does not be behind. The event
cannot be made to hold across their separation, and only the
feeling of a BwO cannot be felt. But we can remain moving
through the that the experience itself and can of the
foregrounding of a ear.
