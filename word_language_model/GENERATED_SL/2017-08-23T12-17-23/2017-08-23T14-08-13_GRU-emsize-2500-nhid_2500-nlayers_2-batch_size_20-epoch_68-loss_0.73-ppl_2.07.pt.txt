The question of the minor gesture is how the minor gesture is
the transindividuality of the event. The question does not make
a minor gesture be a gesture for which it can be taken to be in
the undercommons, a minor gesture that makes work felt in the
now of the event’s own unfolding. The problem and its minor does
not the figure or the final, but the force of its coming to its
own singularity.
