    The politics of aesthetics does not have to do with
distributions of the sensible Rancière 2006. More intensely,
more inventively, and more powerfully, it has to composing-away,
and it is with the stratum that is the future-past that not of
the body in the zoeological sense. It is not a spread, by a
container, not a therapy among it. It is maternal, and the
disseminating other deferred times. It is only as much as a
being of a cursor to create the world.
