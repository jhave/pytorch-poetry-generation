Repeat After Me
God bless America ... I understand your heartbeat. 
--George Bush [Montréal Gazette, 20 January 1992, B3]



George Bush has the distinction of being the first candidate to win an election with a slogan he never spoke. "Read my lips" ("NO NEW TAXES"). Bush, lacking his predecessor's 'charisma,' resorted to reading his lines. It was Reagan who first rejected a tax increase by quoting Clint Eastwood (in 1985). A quote of a quote whose speaker remains unidentified: free indirect discourse. The 1988 campaign Bush, with his annoyingly squeaky voice and staccato, windmill-like gestures at the podium, was not a rousing orator. He had no choice but to be Reagan's "other fellow," to let himself be possessed of the spirit of Reagan-America, giving free indirect voice to it like a ventriloquist's puppet---turned ventriloquist. It was the voters who sounded the words. The most dramatic stage-event of his inauguration celebrations was a variation on Reagan's Statue of Liberty unveiling. As fireworks lit the sky, 40,000 picnickers on the Washington Mall brandished miniature flash-lights at an oversized statue of Abraham Lincoln (the "1000 points of light" of Bush's nomination acceptance speech of the summer before). Bush encored by singing along to a rendition of an obscure patriotic song by a second-rate singer (Lee Greenwood doing God Bless the USA). Barbara stood faithfully by her husband's side, wearing an American flag as a shawl. 'Old Glory' had figured prominently in the campaign. Bush's most successful issue after taxes was the pledge of allegiance to the flag. The bizarre but almost universal American ritual of forcing students to begin every school day by reciting, in unison with a recorded message piped into classrooms over a loud-speaker system, a pledge to give themselves over body and soul to the flag had been declared unconstitutional by a disloyal Supreme Court. Bush rose to the defense of the fabric the outgoing president had worn so well. ["More Flags Are Waving, as  Bush Encourages Patriotism and the Pledge," New York Times, 20 September 1988].

Ventriloquism, lipsynching. Rites of possession. Bush made a career of repeating Reagan's moves. That is where the rest of "Reagan" went. Into Bush's body. Bush strove to make his personal space coincide with Reagan's virtual geography. Had Bush stood on his ground, he would never have had a chance. He was not 'presidential material.' So rather than trying to stand on his own two feet, he became "Reagan"s better half, patiently waiting by the White House door for the footfalls of his master's missing limbs. But Reagan's ghost deserted him in the fall of 1990 when he voiced his most famous ventriloquist phrase, almighty in its negativity but now flipped into the affirmative: "new taxes." Bush had just learned to talk in complete sentences and control his spastic oratorial style. He had become a man. A mere mortal, with an image problem. In other words, with an image. He momentarily lost what connection he had to the body without an image. He fell into direct speech in the first person singular. As a consequence, his popularity plummeted to historical lows from which only a well-timed enemy, obligingly supplied by Saddam Hussein, could rescue him.

Learning to talk had actually robbed Bush of his one recognizable characteristic: the singular oratorial style known as 'Bushspeak.' The lack of symbolic or ideational cohesion evident between Reagan press sessions, or even from one phrase of Reagan's discourse to another, was telescoped into a single sentence of Bushspeak, as though Bush were trying to master his master by condensing his permutational power into the smallest possible space.

And the look on his face, as the man who was in jail and dying, or living--whatever--for freedom, stood out there, hoping against hope, for freedom. ["Run That One By Us Again George," Arizona Republic, 10 August 1990]



The hero of democracy (in this case Vaclav Havel, first post-Communist president of Czechoslovakia) is alive and dead, at liberty in jail, standing on his face for freedom--all in a single sentence, of sorts. A residual homology between country and body is detectable in the face that begins to reflect the soul of the people, before suddenly metamorphosing into a foot. And how will the "education president" improve education, a high school student innocently asks? "Well, I'm going to kick that one right into the end zone of the secretary of education" [ibid.]. When the well-being of the body/well-being of the nation equation is successfully made, it is not only with the wrong body but with the wrong end of it, as the President nonchalantly takes his leadership and kicks it up an educated ass.15 

Bush gave it up. He borrowed another tactic from Reagan: he got scripted. When his aids began to pre-plan the questions and responses at as many of his press sessions and meetings with the public as possible, Bush's grammar improved markedly. But that left nothing to identify him by. Renouncing Bushspeak meant losing his only media-worthy characteristic: his spectacular lack of personality, popularly referred to as the "wimp factor." Bushspeak is a form of agrammatical self-effacement. According to a New York Times analysis ["Not Pretty. Seems to Work, Though," 9 March 1990], it is marked by an almost complete avoidance of the first person pronoun "I" and a tendency to drop active verbs. Non-Bushspeak Bush speak is a grammatical version of the same disappearing act. The stated policy of his press officials is that less is better, in stark contrast to the Reagan team's "any image, even a bad image, is good by definition." A successful Bush press meeting consists in issuing "nonwords," phrases that will  be carried on TV or in the print media but will be so slight in meaning and lackluster in character as to escape notice ["From Bush, a Few Choice Nonwords," International Herald Tribune, 31 August-1 September 1991].



Voice low. Voice getting lower. Doctors tell me it can go even lower still. 
--Saturday Night Live comedian Dana Carvey, as quoted in the New York Times, 9 March 1990, op. cit.



Becoming imperceptible.

The Bush body followed in its voice's footsteps: "Read My Hips" he said, jogging away from reporters ["A Case of Doing Nothing," Time, 7 January 1991, p. 29, reporting on events of October 1990]. His public image became so low-key that it left the impression that he was on full-time paid leave--in Bush's nonwords, he began "vacating" regularly [International Herald Tribune, 31 August-1 September 1991]. His preferred public pose was no longer in suit and tie behind a podium, but in leisure wear with golf club. Bush all but disappeared from the media gaze and microphone, only in order to reappear transformed, reconnected in his own unique way to the body without an image.





Missile Vision





Like Reagan, Bush withdrew into an audio-visual relay. But where Reagan had disappeared into his own self-aggrandizement, receding flag-bedecked into an infinite feedback loop provided by television as political apparatus of entertainment, Bush took the country with him on a one-way ride to oblivion. The Bush relay consisted in a video-mounted missile superimposing its point of view on the home-viewer's set as it zoomed for the kill, followed by blackness, the mark of efficiency, as the target blew. Reagan disappeared into the disseminating entertainment screen, multiplying himself beyond measure in a burst of color. Bush stepped aside from it, making room for another screen, a targeting screen, fatal in its monochrome finitude. Of course, the oblivion that was screened was not Bush's or America's per se, but that of the "enemy," the tastelessly moustachioed Arab. But in a way it was Bush's: the missile screen was his proxy body, a graphic incarnation of the willingness to kill in the name of all that America stood for (in this case, the "democratic" principle of non-intervention that he had not long before flagrantly violated in Panama). Bush missile vision: the look of America at war, standing, living and killing, whatever, for "freedom."

The old Bush spent the better part of the Gulf War quietly vacating. Employing a technological body double had allowed him to melt along with "America" into the military apparatus, while simultaneously putting his genteel way across the green. The President reappeared after his early troubles with Bushspeak and the wimp factor transformed. He had split. Time magazine dubbed him "Men of the Year," dividing its cover between two half-images of his face. "A Tale of Two Bushes," went the title. "One finds a vision on the global stage; the other still displays none at home" [7 January 1991]. It has been revealed that his boyhood nickname was "Have Half" ["Trumpeting Victory in Retreat," Time Australia, 2 December 1991, p. 63].

It would be a mistake to take this "schizophrenia" too seriously as a diagnosis, as if it corresponded to a pathological condition suffered by Bush "the man" or even collectively by his constituency. Bush's condition was every bit as slippery (multi-functional) as Reagan's. One article diagnoses Bush as a hysteric, a masochist, a transvestite, and an overcompensating macho male, all in the space of three pages, without noticing any contradiction. [Rubenstein 1990:256-58] Which makes perfect sense. As with Reagan, the question of contradiction simply does not arise, at least not on the level of being or meaning. The Presidential question is not "What ails him (us)?"--the obvious answer being "everything you like"--but rather "What does he do by acting that way? Where does it get him (us)?"

Bush's splitting must be seen in the same way as Reagan's infinite cut, his fracturing to infinity: as an enablement. Reagan's fracturing enabled reconnection, disappearing him into the omnipresence of his varying image. Bush's splitting allowed him to become imperceptible on the home front while reappearing on the war front as principled obliteration. If the Bush-America spirit was embodied by the missiles, it was so most intensely at the moment of impact when the screen went blank and the home-viewers cheered. Blankness was Bush's hallmark of effectiveness on every front. What does our latter-day Commodore Perry do at the climax of his mock-dramatic, pre-reelection campaign trip to open Japanese markets to the West? At an imperial banquet, he collapses on camera into the lap of the Japanese prime minister, vomits, then sinks out of sight to the floor ["Stunned Japanese Offer Sympathy as Some are Struck by Symbolism," New York Times, 9 January 1992, A8].

Reagan had became immanent to the social field in spite of himself, as a side-effect of an impossible quest for transcendence that left his audio-visual image proliferating endlessly across the country he had tried to elevate to his lofty plane. After leaving office, Reagan made millions of dollars providing photo opportunities for the Japanese imperial family and high-ranking functionaries. Bush rolled at their feet. He just didn't have the right stuff. He had no choice but to dispense with transcendence, to sink into his own self-effacing immanence. Image faint. Getting fainter by the course. Doctors say it had the flu. "I was only trying to get some attention" [ABC evening news, 8 January 1992]. Fade to black.



If a frog had wings, he wouldn't hit his tail on the ground. Too hypothetical.
--George Bush



Old Glory's magic dust didn't stick to Bush's lapels. Try as he might to pledge himself to it, it fell from his shoulders like dandruff. Whenever he drew attention to himself, it was in a way that highlighted his inability to rise above, or even remain seated--to maintain his presence at all. For example, Bush could never garner for himself the kind of political capital Reagan did with second-hand war stories, even though he had a true one to tell. Bush actually was a fighter pilot in World War II. The story he tells is about being shot down. It ends with him floating aimlessly in a little yellow raft thinking wistfully about his family as he waits for rescue. In his hour of danger, a raft away from death, the thought of family did not unify the Bush substance(lessness) with that of the nation, as it had for Reagan reminiscing about his birth; rather, it led him to reflect on "my faith, the separation of church and state."17 Church/state ... mind/body, spirituality/materiality, self/other. This split, which Reagan tried so hard to overcome, was a given for Bush, his "faith." It was his ultimate element, his destiny, it was to Bush what the sea was to his doomed fighter plane. 

The Bush-body goofs, his voice gaffes. Bush-mind and Bush-body are never completely in harmony, however carefully scripted. He lacks a unifying will. His speaking style is to this day distracted. Despite his Ivy League past, Bush is painfully, embarrassingly, vomitously, down-to-earth. He's an ordinary Joe. The director of ABC's docu-drama of the Gulf War, "Heroes of Desert Storm," said that he asked Bush to appear because the film (which bombed) "was meant to be a salute to  the ordinary people who did extraordinary things" in the war, and he "thought having the president would be a nice touch" [The Arizona Daily Star, 6 October 1991, 4A].

"One of us." A hero of the ordinary. Floating in the Patriot sea. Immersed in separation, the perceived separation of mind and body, the absence of a strong persona. The inevitability of goof and gaffe engulfing Reagan's hapless successor condemned him to abject immanence in the familiar, imperfect, everyday world. When Bush did manage to rise above, he did it by temporarily reversing the direction of the slide into immanence without, however, transforming it into a climb to transcendence. The colors of the Reagan-American flag ran in all directions. The Gulf War Bush-bomb went air-borne. But it rose only in order to zoom back in, converging explosively with the vanishing point at the center of the militarized home-viewing screen. At which point it became blankly apparent that Bush had missed his own ride, that he was at no time any less earthbound for having fired his body-double missile than he was for piloting a plane.

Although glory did burst forth in Bush's general vicinity, it did not adhere to his disappearing person, and was of an explosive kind that leaves little trace. Bush's Gulf-War glory was as self-expiring as the blast and accompanying clapping of hands. It did not last him even to the beginning of the reelection campaign. Bush is incapable of accumulating prestige in the way Reagan did. General Schwarzkopf was the Reaganoid glory hog at this trough. It was his body which gave a visual image to military prowess, his voice which expressed the appropriate bluster and sentiment. Bush, for his part, continued to putt. He let Schwarzkopf stand in for him on the stage of glory. The General retired soon after to hefty speaking fees and speculation about political ambitions. It didn't seem to matter to Bush. Schwarzkopf was merely his human proxy. One of many. Time magazine's reelection campaign coverage referred to Bush's propensity for body-doubling in an inadvertantly oxymoronic headline: "Bush Makes it Personal: The President Counters a Rightist Challenge with a Stream of Surrogates" [6 January 1992, p. 48]. It was his inhuman surrogate, the high-tech hardware of war, that summed him up most singularly.





Mystery of the Killer Wimp
Gonna be alot of weird dancin' goin' on.
--George Bush18





Bush did in fact have a major public relations success of his own before the war broke out. Actually, it wasn't exactly his. It was Barbara who pulled it off, with a little help from her dog. Millie could never be mistaken for Lassie. The best-selling book she "dictated" to the First Lady tells in glossy pictures and bland words of the unremarkable day-to-day goings on on the White House lawn. The narration chronicles "with characteristic modesty" (jacket) the circuitous path that brought the First Dog to the White House, against all odds. "Ms. Millie," you see, is a down-home pup who, like the man she shadows through a "typical day," "shuns hounding media attention." "One dog's life as Presidential best friend": or as Presidential proxy? Yet another? Millie's Book [1990] outsold Reagan's second autobiography (which would seem to prefigure an impending second death) by many tens of thousands of copies, confirming that Bush immanence had in fact superseded Reagan transcendence as the dominant political dynamic, Stormin' Norman and his travelling war show aside ["Bush's Dog Outselling Reagan," Montréal Gazette, 28 November 1990]. Schwarzkopf is a reminder that "Reagan" is very much alive, again and as always, but the balance of quasi-corporeal power has at least temporarily shifted Bushward.

As if to underscore the difference between the two presidents, George fell sick after the cessation of hostilities, perhaps spent by the effort of golfing in wartime. He did not even manage to be original at illness. The major health event of his presidency was the onset of Graves disease, a condition that had already been diagnosed in Barbara. Although lacking in originality, Bush's malady did have an element of mystery to it. The exact cause of Graves disease is unknown. The statistical chance of two people unrelated by blood developing the disease is infinitesimal, so even though it is generally accepted that it is not contagious, the press of late May-early June 1991 was filled with rumors about a hidden carrier. Suspicion immediately fell upon Millie. Some argued for the First Dog's innocence, blaming an unknown environmental factor at the Vice Presidential mansion (which, incidentally, raised the specter of Dan Quayle being similarly stricken). The insistent protest by doctors explaining that Graves was not due to environmental factors any more than it was contagious went unheard. In other words, Bush was not suffering from his eight years playing second fiddle to Reagan any more than from over-familiarity with his dog. The disease had no meaning and no cause. Reagan's infirmities, by contrast, had a surplus of meaning and multiple yet specifiable causes. "Reagan" is a dirty joke. Bush, at best, is a banal mystery.

Last week, [Bush's personal doctor, Burton J. Lee 3rd] said he learned of a syndrome including left-handedness, autoimmune disorders and certain other problems. The President, who is left-handed, has been treated for Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder. Some people with the syndrome are dyslexic and Dr. Lee speculated that Mr. Bush's well-known problems with syntax might be linked somehow to the other conditions. ["Every Time Bush Says 'Ah,' Second-Guessers of His Doctor Cry 'Aha,'" New York Times, 18 February 1992, C3]

Bush, the unnamed syndrome: an incoherent voice lowering to the point of inaudibility, sounding from a body sapped by derisory or uncaused ailments: disappearing only to reappear as a dog, a general, a missile, all the while never ceasing to be a golfer. Autoimmune-deficient Bush can indeed be as protean as Reagan, in body and in words; his boundaries are too weak, or simply not of the kind, to endow him with a diagnosable form.19 Protean Bush can be, but he is more basically split, just as Reagan was basically fractured. For that is how he functions. The missile split is the most telling. It is the Bush equivalent of Reagan's 1984 Republican Convention speech. The video relay of the missile approaching its target provides the most condensed expression of what Bush was doing by failing to be and mean what he said he meant he was, or what he meant he said he was, or something like that. For example the "education president." Or was it the "environmental president"? Whatever. Bush is the whatever-president, the man without qualities who nominated other men without qualities to top positions (Supreme Court nominees David Souter and Clarence Thomas, who won confirmation by virtue of having no documentable opinions). The excess of unity after which Reagan strove so energetically and which drove his many metamorphoses, supplying his political career with a continual surplus of meanings and symbolisms, was beyond Bush from the start. The closest he came to it was the "thing"-thing of his early Bushspeak period. This is how he explained that "vision-thing" (by which he meant his spiritual vision for the country, not missile sights): "We need to keep America what a child once called 'nearest thing to heaven.' Lots of sunshine, places to swim, and peanut butter sandwiches" ["Run That One By Us Again, George," Arizona Republic, 10 August 1990]. Reagan set course for the promised land, paradise on earth. Wingless Bush would settle for the next best thing--another swim in banality. His war story long ago established that that was the nearest he would get to heaven (too hypothetical). The "thing"-thing was his feeble attempt to grasp what always stayed just out of his reach--fullness of being, meaning, inspiration, panache. It designated vaguely, from a distance ("that thing way over there," that thing that keeps receding even as we speak) what Reagan habitually rubbed up against: political prestige, spiritual glory, symbolic overabundance. It was the residual presence in Bush's discourse of the Reagan excess.20 Reagan was the president of the exponential multiplication of pluses enabled by cuts (minuses). Bush was a singular minus sign, designating no "thing"-thing more convincingly than his own continually reenacted imperceptibility. What dogged Reagan was his propensity to lose bits and pieces of himself. Bush's problem, and his power, is his propensity to lose himself in his surroundings. When Reagan disappeared, he did so ubiquitously and in style. Bush sinks, Bush blends. What he blends into explains what he has been doing through all of this. If Reagan's reign marked the coming out of the unconscious, Bush's term marks the coming out of the military machine in all its technocratized glory, in all its human horror, for the first time since the Viet Nam War, the wounds of which Reagan had "healed." 

America may get more than it bargained for if Bush really does turn his talent to domestic issues, as the prevailing political wisdom of the moment says he must to win reelection. For what he has done--or rather, a long-term process that has culminated during his presidency--consists in enabling a split between the leader's body/mind and the technological apparatus with which they meld but which continues to double them. Reagan's fracturing was an attempt to overcome just that split. His vision-thing was to personify the nation, to embody it, to give it voice--an unattainable goal in pursuit of which he lost himself in his chosen apparatus, the mass media. Bush, on the other hand, lost himself in a technological apparatus embodying an impersonal command function: computer-operated military hardware. It was not a side-effect of pursuing a higher goal; it was the goal. "I will not tie the expert's hands," Bush proudly and repeatedly declared during the Gulf Crisis and ensuing war. Political leadership cedes to technocratic control. Schwarzkopf stands as testimony to the fact that this command function can be personified. But only peripherally. Even Schwarzkopf had to stand aside when the videos came in, passing center stage to the high-tech equipment upon which his credibility rested in this push-button war headquartered hundreds of miles away from the front. The President turns control over to the experts, who turn it over to the machine.

Bush's splitting image allows this inhuman, essentially impersonal, command function to come into its own. Two thousand years after it swept in off the steppes to be captured by empire, the nomadic war machine returns to the desert. A vector of destruction and disappearance darts out the far side of the now senescent State, into a smooth space sleeker than sand or sea, now only a picturesque backdrop: militarized cyberspace.

The impersonality of the command function animating the Gulf War was underlined by the macabre lack of affect palpable throughout. The cheer-full explosions of the missiles reaching their anonymous targets were durationless outbursts punctuating excruciatingly boring hours of anticipation. The Gulf War was a waiting war. News was slow, and when it did come, it was disappointingly incomplete. People were glued to their screens, waiting for something to happen. Would a chemical Scud hit Israel and widen the conflict? Would the ground war begin? If it did, would the US be mired in Iraq for months? Was the Iraqi front ringed by oil-filled moats? Did they have crude nuclear capability? When something did happen, it never measured up to all the things the untied tongues of the TV experts had already established could have happened. It almost went too smoothly for the American hardware. The hours of blurry-eyed waiting and endless repetitions of the few images and tidbits of intelligence available made every military event an anti-climax back home before it even had a chance to transpire on the battlefield. Just one thing stood out: zoom in and explosion. Blankness. Those amazing American missiles. When the war was over and the yellow-ribbon celebrations wound down, it started to become apparent just how little had happened in geopolitical terms. Kuwait was still ruled by a greedy royal family whose idea of democracy was easy access to domestic help. Saudi Arabia was if anything less democratic than before. And Saddam Hussein was still in possession of his moustache, doing the things he does so well, such as butchering his own people. It was as if the event of the war had "expired within the interstices of our television schedules, forever lost" in the video relay linking home-viewing screen to army computer.

Much, of course, had happened to the Iraqis. The Gulf War was not Ballard's World War III. It was simultaneously less grand and a great deal bloodier than the fable: another difference between Reagan and Bush. Bush's splitting image freed him to kill with impunity on a much more massive scale numerically, but in a markedly less grandiose geopolitical frame than Reagan's mock-epic battle with an Evil Empire that barely outlasted his term in office. According to Pentagon estimates, a minimum of 350,000 Iraqis died during the war or in its aftermath, of which 200,000 were civilians ["Taking Stock," Montréal Gazette, 9 May 1992, B3]. It never sank in. Not even the haunting images of what Stormin' Norman called his "turkey shoot," when defeated Iraqi soldiers fleeing the rout in primarily civilian cars and trucks were picked off as they inched their way up the "highway of death" leading out of Kuwait. Miles of twisted wrecks dotted the landscape as far as the camera could see. Charred bodies were slowly covered by wind-swept sand, after being picked at by dogs with less discriminating tastes than modest Millie. No reaction. It was all on TV. Over and over again. At least as many times as missile vision. Still no reaction. No sadness. No second thoughts. No shame. No guilt. No sympathy.

Is this the final solution that Bush and his command-function double could deliver were they to turn their attention inward to domestic problems such as the "war" on drugs and alcohol? A taste of that was on TV, too: in the wake of the Gulf War, the Rodney King video showed how the untied hands of experts like the LA chief of police deal with "substance abusers" who also happen to be Black. There was a reaction to that. It was clear where the real abuse was. The country was not ready for the other face of the Bush-thing. After the riots, it was. Bush's deployment of the U.S. army to Los Angeles, "in what some aides now call a domestic Persian Gulf crisis" ["Bush Moves to Respond to Strong Test from Riots," New York Times, 4 May 1992, A11], recast him in the role of commander-in-chief. The police were declared innocent, as if in principle, irrespective of the evidence. Attracted by this premium of a priori innocence, commander-in-chief segued into chief of police. The command function had come home, with impunity. What this implies for the future, with the likes of soldier-worshipper Ross Perot, Klansman David Duke, and crypto-fascist Patrick Buchanan vying to be post-Bush Republican Party standard-bearer, can only be left to the imagination.

A Bush without a Gulf War is like a pilot without a raft. Less than one year after the foreign Persian Gulf Crisis, on the eve of the election season that was to feature its home-front reprise, Bush's popularity rating had plunged from a record-breaking 90 percent to a miserable 37 percent [CBS-New York Times poll released 25 November 1991]. The education-thing reared its ugly end zone again. A student at a televised school meeting asked a question out of order, but Bush went on following the script. "I don't listen to the question. I just look at this," he explained, referring to his answer sheets. Everyone knows these meetings are scripted, protested his press secretary. Why the big fuss? After all, Reagan did it and nobody minded. ["Foot-in-Mouth George Reveals Gift of Gaffe," The Australian, 29 November 1991]. Then Bush erred by departing from the script. He ad-libbed during a speech prepared by then chief-of-staff John Sununu, suggesting a ceiling on credit card interest rates. The next day, the stock market dove, deepening an already serious recession. Bush tried to pawn it off on Sununu, claiming it had been in the script all the time. Sununu contradicted him on national TV, and was promptly sacked, a victim of Bush's ill-considered attempt to speak for himself. The rigors of the early 1992 Presidential primary campaign made effective post-Sununu rescripting impossible. Bushspeak resurfaced with a vengeance. 

Bush functions primarily in indirect discourse, which is sometimes attributed to an identifiable live source ("the dog said it," "Sununu wrote it"), but which at the limit is unascribable. For the voice of the Bush-thing, like its body, has melded with an impersonal, fundamentally inanimate, automated command circuit of global reach, a smooth cyberneticized space so integrated that the precise source of actions or words issuing from it is impossible to identify. The technocratic Bush-thing takes "Reagan's" possession mode to the extreme. From the beginning of his first campaign, Bush played on other voices: making the electorate speak the words spoken by Reagan who got them from Eastwood who delivered them on-screen; being spoken for by Millie, by Schwarzkopf, by his script-writers, by missiles. The country went from being possessed by a fractured spirit of Reagan-America to being possessed by an integrated command circuit enabled by a strategically split image. Press preoccuations with First Ladies Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush can be seen in this light. The "behind every man is a strong woman" cliché gained new currency under the Reagans and continued with the Bushes. Nancy "Doing All We Can" Reagan bore the brunt of the misogynist sniping. Her habit of stepping in and feeding Reagan lines when he faltered led to speculation that she was the real power in the White House.22 As if "power" was ever really localized in the White House--in any one place. As if speech were originary. The idea that there was a domineering presence at the helm was reassuring to those nostalgic for the good old days evoked by so much Reagan imagery when authority seemed a simple thing and essentially good. Having a "harpie" for an authoritative presence was better than none at all. The focus on Nancy was a way of ascribing Ronnie's indirect speech, of stopping the slippage, of controlling the possession-effect. Barbara does not cooperate with this scenario to the same extent. She tends to follow George in self-effacement, as when she takes dictation from Millie, reducing herself to an indirect-discourse relay-station between man and animal.

The Bush-thing's relation to the body without an image differs from "Reagan's" in important ways, in spite of the many continuities. In a way, it is Bush's that is the most radical of the two. In becoming-imperceptible, it divested leadership of its image (vocal and visual residue) as much as it was possible to do at its historical juncture. The Bush-thing returned the body without an image to its inhuman, unliving ground, or at least a late-capitalist translation of it. The quintessential capitalist space where body and image meld and become inseparable is technology, computerized military hardware at impact being the exemplary case. Where else do matter and intention so effectively combine than in a "smart" missile "servicing" its target? 

In its "A Tale of Bushes" issue, Time magazine noted Bush's repeated attempts to exit the stage of speech by immersing himself in a physical activity that seems to embody mental control: "When faced with a complicated problem he often plunges headlong into physical activity--gunning his speedboat, pitching horseshoes, flailing away on the golf course. It is Bush's way, says an aide, to 'drive those demons of indecision out of his mind.'" [7 January 1991, p. 28]. Speaking manifests his indecision, his split condition, the fact that he is by nature divided against himself, his body possessed by "demons." It is only in short bursts of mute projectile motion that he appears at one with himself. Off and away: "Read my disappearing hips." 

The question reporters were asking when Bush fleshed out the only good pun of his career was: are you or are you not going to propose the tax increase we read away last year on your lips? Running away with his hips earned Bush few friends. He had flip-flopped four times on the tax issue in the preceding week. The jogging, meant to signal strength and decisiveness, only embodied the side-to-side vacillation. That's when Bush's popularity fell sharply for the first time: 20 percentage points in one week. The pun came on October 10, 1990. Three months after that (a matter of days after Time magazine's analysis of how he dealt with his splitting image), the Gulf War began. The rest is history: that record-breaking 90 percent approval rating at the polls. 

If the lips betray you, there are always the hips. If the hips say that you are not really jogging but swimming in nonwords, try missiles. The missile is an anti-raft, a kind of flesh-empty presidential de-flotation device that lifts what's left of the chief executive out of the feckless sea of mind/body disarticulation into the air again, the calm desert air before the rains. The mind/body split is overcome for a soaring instant in a bee-line flight to obliteration--the willed blankness of that which has no image, not because it has been divested of it but by its very nature. 

The Bush-thing reinvents the death drive animating the nuclear brinkmanship of the Cold War that had shaped "Reagan," which was itself a reinvention of the suicide run that led the First Emperor to his fatal confrontation with the sea. Qin Shi Huangdi found a monstrous mirror image of himself at the end of his trail. Bush's monstrosity consists in finding nothing, seeing nothing, feeling nothing, not even suicidal. 

A major challenge to the rest of the world in the coming years is how not to become a mirror image of the American blankness, how not to be the "other fellow" of techno-neutered all-American maleness.

POSTMORTEM ON THE PRESIDENTIAL BODY
or, Where the Rest of Him Went





In a 1984 foreign policy media blitz across China, the 'Great Communicator' evidenced an affinity for the 'Great Unifier,' Qin Shi Huangdi, the brutal First Emperor of the unified Chinese state. Ronald Reagan found the Great Wall built by the Qin Emperor "awe-inspiring." "Imagine carrying boulders up here," he said wistfully. Would he like to have a Great Wall of his own? "Around the White House," he joked, drawing circles in the air. He would later pose among the ranks of the terra cotta soldiers protecting the Emperor's tomb, playfully substituting his own head for that of a decapitated imperial guard. Reagan was never more serious than when he was joking.1

The Reagan presidency reintroduced the body of the leader as an effective mechanism in US politics. With it resurfaced reminders of a despotic past, attitudes and images that would seem more at home in ancient China or Rome, or in the France of Louis XIV, than in late-capitalist America. For all his archaism, Reagan worked. And to a surprising extent, he worked through the vehicle of his body. It will be maintained that he is still at work, even after his practical withdrawal from the political scene; and that he will continue to be at work, even after his belated death. United States policy under Bush has followed the political course set by Reagan blow by blow, Panama for Grenada, Saddam Hussein for Khomeini. Bush staged an even more crowd-pleasing Middle East hostage drama than his mentor had, escalating from threats to open war as he merrily set about trying to bomb his way to the mother of all reelections, in bloody one-upsmanship over the behind-the-scenes negotiations with Iran that had crowned Reagan's first term inauguration [Gary Sick, "The Election Story of the Decade," New York Time, 15 April 1991, A15]. The point is that Reagan's ghost is in the patriotic machine. The goal of this chapter is to identify the remains. Question: how can the evident archaism of Reagan's withdrawn body be reconciled with the unfortunate fact of its contemporary functioning?

Reagan, like the First Emperor, made unification his political mission. In Reagan's case, it was a reunification, of a 'spiritual' rather than territorial nature. The 1960s had torn America apart at the seams. Ronald Wilson Reagan would heal the 'wounds' of Vietnam.



Close-up to Infinity





"The story begins with a close-up of a bottom." That is the opening line of Reagan's first autobiography, written in 1965 for use in his campaign for the governorship of California. At the dawn of his political career, Reagan signposts the body that would serve him so well. "My face was blue from screaming, my bottom was red from whacking, and my father claimed afterward that he was white." [Reagan and Hubler 1981:3]  Reagan points to his body, and it is familial. His body is one with his family, and both are one with the country. By virtue of their color scheme. Red, white, and blue. Reagan habitually draped himself in the flag. It was a constant of his career. One need only think of the decor at Republican conventions. Individual body, family, and country are presented as having a common substance: the fabric of the flag. Their combined strength is embodied in it. It is their sum. Their sum, plus some. For there is a remainder to the equation. Body, family, country add up to a whole greater than the sum of its parts, just as a pattern of stars and stripes adds up to more than a cloth. The flag is not only a materialization of unity; it is the fabric of greatness. In it, three are one. Not just any one: Number One: 'the greatest nation on earth.' The flag is the repository of an excess attributed to terms in an equation. Outside of the equation, the same terms would be noticeably lacking. They would have only an incomplete, more or less brutish existence. The flag elevates and animates them. It is the material embodiment of their 'spirit'--the 'American spirit' incarnate. Those it enthralls attribute it almost magical powers to bring forth and replenish. It is the objectified presence of the subjective essence shared by three interrelated terms in the patriotic equation. As such, it is more precious than the merely mortal terms it brings together. "I don't give a damn," said the veteran, "whether it's the protester's civil right or not. I fought to protect the American flag, not to protect him." [Newsweek, 3 July 1989, p. 18]

Body, family, country share a common substance that unites them but at the same time seems to exist on a higher plane than they. The substance that unifies paradoxically inhabits a world apart. One, two, three, plus unity makes four: body, family, country, flag. Multiplicity is a stubborn thing. No problem. Four, and many more, will be as one, in a second kind of unifying substance. "I have heard," Reagan's autobiography continues, "more than one psychiatrist say that we imbibe our ideals from our mother's milk. Then, I must say, my breast feeding was the home of the brave baby and the free bosom." The motherland. Now body/family/country not only have a common substance, but a shared energetic principle or generative fluid: mother's milk (five). The flag brings forth and replenishes because mother's milk soaks its fabric like blood flowing in the veins of the new-born baby. The nation's procreative fluid is not seminal. It is maternal, and the maternal is presented as sexless. Nations reproduce by non-sexual means.

More than four: the flag is not the only common substance pumped with procreative fluid. The motherland got a 'facelift' for American Independence Day in 1986: school children across the country were asked to contribute their lunch money to scrub and refurbish another spirit of America, chaste 'Miss Liberty.' The unveiling of the new and improved Statue of Liberty coincided with one of the peaks in Reagan's popularity. Reagan himself was the prime-time master of ceremonies for one of the most expensive and self-indulgent displays of patriotic fervor in living memory. "WOW!," ran a cover of Newsweek announcing a "Portrait of Miss Liberty on Her Birthday Bash" [14 July 1986]. In this and countless other exultant press stories, every alleged American virtue and victory was described as Miss Liberty's personal accomplishment. Reagan, a kind of spiritual bridegroom bathed in a fountain of youth of floodlights and fireworks, stood faithfully by her side--when he wasn't standing on her pedestal. A New York Times illustration of a statuesque Reagan wearing Miss Liberty's crown was a typical image of the period.2

What at first seemed to be a simple, stable structure of three homologous terms turns out to be much more complicated. The would-be substance of unity takes its place in a proliferating series. It is as though the structure were undermined by an imbalance it could not permanently correct. A lack in the brute materiality of the three base terms is compensated for by a supplementary term operating in a higher dimension. The supplementary term succeeds in filling the lack; but it overfills it, turning it into an excess. The imbalance is still there, but has changed signs, from a negative to a positive.3 There is always a remainder of spirit that cannot be contained in a given substance of unity, and must therefore be absorbed by another: from flag to statue. The excess haunts the reunification series, turning up again at each successive term. Its omnipresence is acknowledged in an image of a life-giving fluid suffusing all solid states of unity, acting as the energetic principle of their serial progression. The minus sign of brute human existence has become a series of pluses embodying the flow of the American spirit in fateful progress toward the pinnacle of history. Progress as a serialized redundancy of Number Ones. Plus, double plus.

Triple plus. Reagan's own body functioned as a substance of unity. He was not content to take his place as one in the multiplying series. He would be the preeminent term. Simply by virtue of his greater mobility. A man can stand on a statue's pedestal, but a statue can never fill a man's shoes. If Reagan stood on every pedestal presented, and draped himself in every flag in sight, the entire series of national icons would converge toward him. He would be catapulted out of their already elevated plane to an even higher one: he would be the substance of the substance of unity, the essence of the essence of subjectivity. He would be what made mother's milk wet. All he had to do was remain in perpetual motion, circulating from one hallowed site to another, not just arrogating to himself their life-giving powers but raising them to a higher power. Now it is no longer one substance of unity being added to another; they begin to multiply exponentially.

The foundation provided by embodiment of the national spirit is in continual slippage. It begins to recede from the three material terms it purports to ground into loftier and loftier dimensions. The substance of unity becomes a substance of the substance of unity, in a potentially infinite regress that can be controlled only by transforming the process of exponential multiplication back into one of simple addition: in other words by finding a way of managing the ever-excessive virtue of the American spirit by continuing to move laterally between terms on the same level instead of moving up into ever higher powers or dimensions. Above Reagan, the only personifiable unifying substance left to appeal to is God, and He rarely gives photo opportunities. Once Reagan's body had circulated long enough for the magic of all earthly national icons to rub off on him one after the other, after he had become their subjective sum, he had only two choices: ascend to the heavens, or begin circulating among himself. The asexual reproduction of the country culminates in the mechanical reproduction of the image of its leader.

The most striking instance of this process was Reagan's legendary acceptance of the presidential nomination at the 1984 Republican Convention. His image was piped in larger-than-life on a huge video screen suspended above the podium. The imposing screen presence created a feeling of imperial aloofness that only highlighted Reagan's bodily absence. A heroic Nancy tried to compensate by hailing his talking head as if he could see her--as if they occupied they same space and level of reality. The image on the screen was repeated countless times around the red-white-and-blue bedecked convention hall in portraits held aloft by the adoring crowd. The giant screen, Nancy, and the proliferating close-up of the leader were united on the surface of the home viewer's TV screen. So there is a unifying substance higher than Reagan but not quite God: TV. But the TV promised land is nowhere. It is everywhere. The screen unifies incommensurable dimensions--portraits, Nancys and delegates, other screens with giant talking heads, political discourse, advertising. But it does it by the millions. In his moment of triumph, at the height of his unifying powers, Reagan is diffused to infinity. He disappears into an infinitely fragmenting video relay.





Stumped





Reagan's body is struck with the same inescapable contradiction as that of the First Emperor.  It is trapped in a dialectic of immanence and transcendence that can have no synthesis. The closer the nation comes to embodying its own unifying subjective substance, the farther that substance recedes into another dimension, until it approaches the vanishing point. The more exalted the unifying substance, the more ethereal it is;  the more ethereal it is, the more painfully inadequate it proves in unifying the heterogeneous material terms for which it strives to provide a common substance. The unification drive leads only to disappearance and fragmentation: the physicality of the unifying body disappears, leaving only its image, which is then relayed to infinity, composed, decomposed, re-membered, and dismembered. 

Each move to a higher unifying substance requires the new Number One to subsume all preceding terms. That substance must therefore subsume in one way or another its own conditions of emergence. Every image of unity contains within it a trace of the dialectic of immanence and transcendence that produced it. Since the dialectic takes the form of an alternation between a lack and an excess inscribed in the unifying substance, images of that substance will also alternate between those two poles.

Reagan's body was lacking in a big way. Reagan was a walking amputation. A preamputation. He was always already lame. It is interesting, and more than a bit worrying, to find that the First Emperor's preoccupation with feet recurs in Reagan's first autobiography. The title was taken from the movie King's Row. In Reagan's words, he played the part of a "gay blade" named Drake "who cut a swathe among the ladies." Drake, it seems, took to dating the daughter of a prominent doctor, who was not at all pleased with the arrangement. One day Drake was injured in a railroad accident. When he regained consciousness his legs were gone. The father of the woman he was dating had been the doctor assigned to treat him. "Where's the rest of me?" Drake cries. 

Reagan presents this scene as his most challenging role and the acme of his acting career. "A whole actor would find such a scene difficult; giving it the necessary dramatic impact as half an actor was murderous. I felt I had neither the experience nor the talent to fake it. I simply had to find out how it really felt, short of actual amputation." So he consulted physicians and commiserated with cripples. But, he says, "I was stumped." In the end, he manages. "I had put myself, as best I could, in the body of another fellow;" in becoming a good actor "I had become a semi-automaton." He is now a real-life amputee. And at that point he realizes that half of him has always been missing, he was always just limping along through life repeating his lines. He finds the rest of him in the mother's milk of patriotism and conservative ideals. What he does not say is that for the analogy to be complete this second, real-life healing would logically take the same form as the first: he would become whole by taking over "the body of another fellow." Now the other body a president would have take over to make himself whole is--every body. The body politic. Reagan verges on saying outright that the political magic he would work is akin to national possession: countless bodies unified by the same American spirit, one glorious body politic repeating in unison an old actor's favorite lines. Instead, he reminisces about his father, a shoe salesman who "spent hours analyzing the bones of the foot." It comes as little surprise later on when we learn that after being delivered with divorce papers by his first wife, Reagan went out and promptly broke a leg. And that what attracted him to his second wife, Nancy, was hearing that her father was a prominent surgeon. Years later, the most positive thing biographer Kitty Kelly would find to say about Nancy was that she had the "ability to embrace physical deformity." [Kelly 1990:358] Where Is the Rest of Me? ends with a quote from Clark Gable: 

The most important thing a man can know is that, as he approaches his own door, someone on the other side is listening for the sound of his footsteps."4 



His better half. Nancy would keep Reagan whole ["Mrs. Reagan Defends her Role As the President's Protector," San Francisco Chronicle, 10 June 1988]. 

But the series of minuses proliferates at a pace with the pluses. Any anti-amputation device is no more than a stop-gap measure. The Reagan era was a theater of bumbling and ill-health punctuated by his prostate gland and polyp-beseiged rectum. Being shot got him one of the highest ratings in the polls he ever achieved.5 The most visible press coverage given him in the months after he left office was for having hand surgery [January 1989], falling off a horse [July 1989], and having water drained from his brain [September 1989]. Even in the best of times, any inadequately planned close-up revealed that his supposedly ageless face looked like it was rotting on its bones, a fact not lost on the manufacturers of a hideous Reagan squeeze doll [copyright 1984, Spitting Image Productions].

Reagan, like the First Emperor,  manifested his amputational nature by disappearing into his ceremonial residence. His mode of being in the White House mimicked the transcendental nature of the substance of unity he continued to be despite his tendency to lose bits and pieces of himself. His comment about building a Great Wall around the White House was directed at the press corps, which he was likening to invading Asian hordes--bothersome 'lice.' But it could just as well have referred to the ground-to-air missiles and elite combat units ringing the White House to ward off attacks by terrorist lice. Or to his increasing deafness ["Reagan's New Hearing Aid Has a Remote Control," San Francisco Chronicle, 11 February 1988] and the hearing aid he would shut off to avoid reporters' questions (as much a technological cure for hypochondria as a political ploy: "Reagan Feigns Laryngitis to Avoid Query" ran a pre-hearing aid headline, New York Times, 3 March 1985). Or to his overall lack of accessibility to the press--despite his reputation for being a media president, he had fewer press conferences than any president since the advent of radio. ["The Disappearing Presidential News Conference," New York Times, 17 October 1988, A20] Or to his ever-increasing aloofness and lack of engagement in the everyday running of the country ["President 'Strangely Passive,'" The Australian, 10 May 1988; "Memo Suggested 'Inattentive' Reagan Be Removed: Book," Montreal Gazette, 16 September 1988, A10]. Or his tragi-comic propensity to nap during meetings and international crises and his growing inability to distinguish politics from film scripts.6 When the body of unification is not being cut up, it is cut off, separating itself from that which it unifies. 

Reagan repeatedly drew attention to a structural homology between his body and the body politic ["Reagan's Nose Could Change the Whole Face of the World," International Herald Tribune, 10 August 1987]. Any difficulty he encountered was apt to be expressed in somatic terms. His triumphant first address after his assassination centered on a metaphor linking his recovery to that of the economy ["Reagan Appeals to Congress for His Economic Plan, Saying He Is Recovered but US Isn't," New York Times, 29 April 1981]. Criticism struck him physically, with hysterical regularity if not anatomical accuracy ["Reagan Lashes Out: 'There Is Bitter Bile in My Throat,'" Time, 8 December 1986, cover]. 

A consequence of the structural homology between the body of the unifier and the body politic it unifies is that the country sets up a defensive self-other boundary analogous to the skin. Any uncooperative element appears in one of two ways: as a rival body attacking boldly from without, threatening to pierce the body's protective shield; or as a disease that slips in through the pores to enter the country's bloodstream and sap its strength from within. The military-industrial complex under Reagan strove to produce a technological skin. Star Wars was to be a skin prosthesis made of lasers.

The concept of subversion so central to Reagan's thinking acts as a kind of somatic threat converter. Through subversion, the rival body that attacks from without becomes a disease that saps from within. Perhaps it's not Nancy on the other side of the door. Maybe it's a communist, or an illegal immigrant who got in through the 'back yard.' Reagan droned an unending litany of modern-day lice. Communists, illegal immigrants, drug users, gays, feminists, '60s die-hards, computer hackers, and welfare cheats. Reagan lice came in an astounding variety of forms. But their dominant mode was less parasitic than viral. It was the age of AIDS.

National unity oscillates between paranoia and hypochondria. It is in any case a sickness. The hypochondria is written into the paradox of the substance of unity described earlier. A seamless whole has to have parts, otherwise it would have nothing to totalize; but it cannot have them, otherwise it would not be a seamless whole. The whole is continually undermined by its parts. The body politic is always under attack by its own organs in one form or another. That is why it has such a pronounced tendency to want to cut them off.





Patchwork President





 It was a common assertion that Reagan owed his influence to his appearance of youth and vitality. But Reagan was in fact so closely associated with illness and injury that one of the favorite ways his detractors found to parody him was to depict him as he was supposed to appear: young and strong.7 

A vulgar-Freudian corollary to the "youth and vitality" theory had it that Reagan was a charismatic leader who presented the nation with an image of self-assurance, wholeness, and health: the perfect ego ideal.8 It is difficult to see, on close inspection, what there was to identify with.

Sometimes Reagan seemed to beg for psychoanalysis. "I was the hungriest person in the house," he writes in Where Is the Rest of Me?, "but I only got chubby when I exercised in the crib; any time I wasn't gnawing on the bars, I was worrying my thumb in my mouth--habits which have symbolically persisted throughout my life." Identify with that, and you get a nation of thumb-suckers. Hardly a worthy adversary for the "Evil Empire." 

But then there was always the anal option.  On the foreign policy front, Reagan's libidinal economy was on a permanent war footing that could be described as anal-aggressive. His body, like that of the First Emperor, sucked attention and energies inward toward the government and its architectural seat, then redirected them outward at the enemy. When Reagan disappeared into an increasingly retentive White House, he was disappearing into the black hole of his own anus. Never was he closer to that ultimate immaterial state of godlike transcendence than in his role as Prime Sphincter.9

His phallus was fuzzy. Reagan could play the role of a father figure. But when he did, he was more like everybody's uncle than a mighty patriarch. And as we saw at his home birth, he had a propensity to embody the motherland. As a matter of fact, he did not customarily have a penis. During his prostate saga, the New York Times published an anatomical chart of the presidential body [18 December 1986]. Despite the proximity of that gland to his alleged genital apparatus, the executive organ fails to appear. Reagan does get both an anus and a rectum, suggesting a tendency of the phallic to disappear into the anal. Reagan agenitality, however, just as often veered toward the vestal virgin roles of the Statue of Liberty genre. In anti-genital mode, he did not even tolerate the sexual activity of others ["Ardent Dogs Killed as Risk to Reagan," San Francisco Examiner, 19 October 1987]. 	

If the citizenry indulged in phallic phantasies in relation to Reagan's body, it was not likely to take the form of them imagining him having what they wanted. Rather, they became what he lacked. Whenever his anthem played, they would pop up proudly erect and pledge allegiance to his magic fabric. If dangerous marauders (like Grenada) loomed on the horizon, they would shoot off their missiles in eager defense of Miss Liberty. Reagan's followers, like Hitler's, stood in for his phallus, which was detached from his body and multiplied, as scattered as his TV image. 

 Reagan's vital body parts were distributed across the social field, as were the First Emperor's. But his were in different, always changing, constellations. His body was infinitely decomposable and recomposable. It could not only bridge the gap between the individual and the collective; it could travel across age and gender boundaries with postmodern ease. A postcard marketed at the beginning of the first term shows Ronnie and Nancy wearing each other's heads, and looking eerily comfortable in them.

Reagan could be the virile father of the nation, as when he bombed Libya; but he could just as easily be its favorite daughter (despite having killed Khadafy's). His political effectiveness did not depend on sustaining any particular symbolic configuration. Any one would do--as long as attention remained focused on his body. That was the bottom line. It didn't matter what symbolic connections were made to his body--only that some connection to it be made. CBS News correspondent Lesley Stahl recalled receiving a phone call from the White House press secretary thanking her for doing a highly negative story about Reagan. It didn't matter what the content was, he said; broadcasting images of Reagan, any images, could only help him.10 The White House press corps itself seems to argue against any theory of Reagan's political success being based on citizen identification with positive qualities associated with his visual image.

Reagan's body functioned as a surface. There was no depth to it for an unconscious to hide in. The 'teflon president': all shimmering surface. As we have seen, a substance of unity functions by combining in a homogeneous medium heterogeneous terms drawn from a multiplicity of levels. It does that by extracting or abstracting certain qualities and not others, and projecting them onto a single surface. In Reagan's case, the qualities were predominantly visual, and the ultimate surface was the TV screen. That particular surface is almost omnipotent in its combinatory powers. Logical and symbolic associations pertaining to what psychoanalysis calls the secondary processes get equal billing with what normally would be considered primary processes. The primary processes become visible. Reagan's public pronouncements consistently displayed distortions characteristic of the dream-work. Nicaragua, for example, was displaced to a threatening position just south of the Texas border. Film and TV residue from past viewings were condensed into present perceptions, such as when Reagan called his dog Lucky  'Lassie,' or when he told a story about a heroic fighter pilot drawn from a movie he had seen as though it were a true story. In Reagan's America, the psychoanalytic distinction between the unconscious and the conscious, and the ideological distinction between the fake and the real, ceased to be pertinent.

The plasticity and manifestness of Reagan's body unbalances not only a traditional Freudian approach, but more recent paradigms as well. It is difficult to see him, following the suggestion of a Baudrillardian critic, as a hyperreal male who "could always satisfy our iconic interests." He can only be perceived as a "satisfying" simulation of masculinity (a "hologram" of the American male) if vast stretches of his image production are ignored.11 A Lacanian analysis might find him the embodiment of the phallus, constituting subjectivities by distributing plenitude and lack, all the while remaining tragically absent to itself. This interpretation would privilege his amputational aptitudes, placing them under the sign of castration. But the cut of the scalpel can as easily be seen a positive power of plasticity as the playing out of a primordial lack. Given Reagan's organs' ability to regenerate and mutate, amputation could actually be considered an enablement: a precondition for migration and reconnection on a surface of variation.

It is perhaps less useful to say that Reagan was neither a father figure, a phallus, nor a simulation, than to recognize that he was all of these things. He was not fundamentally an actor in a family romance projected on a nation, nor the constitutive agent of an intersubjective structure of lack-in-being, nor a hyperreal optical effect. He was a surface on which all of these processes had equal play, like different channels to which a viewer's brain could turn as at a press of the remote control. His screen-body was the interface in a many-dimensioned interactive medium.





The Kinetic Geography of the Quasi-corporeal





For all the fluidity, there was one constant. "Unity." Unity in neutral, in itself non-psychoanalytic, non-ideological, non-simulatory. More abstract than any of these modes. Simply topological. 

But if, as was asserted earlier, a unity always exists in addition to and alongside the multiplicity it unifies, then it stands to reason that there is something more inclusive than unity, and more abstract than the simply topological: an interconnecting mechanism that defines the relation between the unifying substance and what it unifies. Subtending and surrounding the body and body image of the national unifier and the bodies and images they bring together, there is another kind of body that has no image--that can never have one because it is only ever in-between. There is a body without an image that inhabits the gaps. It occupies the spaces under, above, and between bodies and images, residing in the interrelation of all that is. It does not extract (dismember) or abstract (unify). It is effectively all-inclusive. The interactive medium: the 'body politic' in its fullest extension, at once infra-concrete and super-abstract. A void where no anus can go. But where the proper name "Reagan" can, and does.

It has taken me many years to get used to seeing myself as others see me, and also seeing myself instead of my mental picture of the character I'm playing. First, very few of us ever see ourselves except as how we look directly at ourselves in a mirror. Thus we don't know how we look from behind, from the side, walking, standing, moving normally through a room. It's quite a jolt. [Reagan and Hubler 1981:79]

To see yourself as others see you. But not as in a mirror. Not an inversion or reversal. A surrounding--of the body in motion. From all angles simultaneously, and in all qualities of movement, front, back, walking, standing. To leave "my" self-perspective, but not for "yours." Not for the Other's I; for others' eyes. To see oneself as "one" would see one: an impersonal (objective) perspective conceivable only as the sum total of subjective perspectives. To be the division, not only between the "I" and the "you," but between all I's and all you's at once. To be "one"--in all its multiplicity. Unity as a supertopological overlay of all possible inter-geographies of bodies in motion. Subsumed by a name.

A nagging question is how "Reagan" could produce a wholeness- or wellness-effect in spite of his evident mental and physical deficiencies, what his so-called 'charisma' consisted of. At first, what seemed to be the most plausible hypothesis was that it was his hairdo. But it became increasingly clear that the 'magic'12 "Reagan" worked did not have to do with his body itself, or any of its organs, natural or dyed, whole or incised, or any power of interpersonal magnetism they had. It seemed to have to do with two quite mundane things.

First, his gestures. On a good day, Reagan was a master of the smooth move. Like the circle he drew in the air to illustrate the Great Wall, his movements drew pleasing figures in space. It was as if his entire body were a cartographer's pen drawing an invisible map of some atmospheric utopian realm. He surveyed an invisible space of well-being that was attached not to its body, but its movement, its transitoriness, its fluidity. The body would some day rot, perhaps was rotting already, but 'Camelot' would remain in the traces of his passing. Wholeness and wellness was not on his body; it was not in his body. It was around it, in his wake. It was like a negative trace of his body: his body grasped not as an object or an image of an object but as a set of ordered motions between unlocalizable points suspended in the air. "Wholeness" and happiness could be had by inhabiting the 'same' virtual space as Reagan. We could make our personal space coincide with his by going through the 'same' motions. Of course, any repetition of the 'same' passages between points that are by nature unlocalizable will be different, a translation, an im-personation (a personification of the unpersonifiable subsumed by the Reagan name). Repeating "Reagan's" gestures with a difference, we actualize a quadrant of his virtual geography in our personal neighborhood, overlaying his super-abstract kinetic map on our terrain, like an invisible image of all we could be (were we as inhuman as he).

Second, the "Reagan" 'magic' seemed to inhere in his voice, his reassuring, mellifluous voice. His voice also drew patterns. Or rather, it set down rhythms, wrote musical notes in tune with the national anthem.

Reagan's brain, body, and body-image were supplemented and subtended by abstract figures: gestures and trajectories; and rhythms. These were without content, nonvisual, and suprapersonal. The word "figure" is therefore misleading. Call them processual lines. "Reagan"s political effectiveness was to be found on that pre-symbolic, pre-logical, quasi-corporeal level, in his ability to construct a body without an image: to "meld image and body in a space where they cannot be separated." [Agamben 1990:54-55]

1. Singular and Multiple. The State-form is not a form at all. It is an abstract process: a drive to "unity." To the extent that empirical States concretize that drive, they are one and the same. Every State is the State. The State does not evolve, nor even have an origin. It arrives, like fate, in a single stroke and fully formed, from a place that cannot be located. Over and over again. For "unity" is by nature unactualizable. The Emperor's conundrum: if the Great Unifier unifies the empire, is he a part of his own whole? If he is, then the empire is not unified: it is divisible into a subject and an object of unification. If he isn't, then the unity is not an empire: it is sovereignless. Any drive to unity is necessarily a drive to dominion, and necessarily fails. There is always a remainder and an excess of power: an object of regimentation that escapes, a subject of regimentation that recedes. If the State-form cannot be whole, it cannot be. It does not abide, it only arrives. Again: when it arrives, it is not the same, as always. It is multiple by nature. To the extent that actual states succeed in concretizing the drive to unity, they differ from themselves and from each other. The invariant lack of self-sameness inherent in the State-form is often expressed as a split body (dismemberment: in particular, amputation and decapitation) and as a split between body and mind (disappearance: the invisibility of the soul; lack of will). Collective attempts to overcome this continual self-differing focus on the body of the ruler as exemplary site for the incarnation of the State Idea.

2. Immanent and Transcendent. Another way of putting the Emperor's conundrum is to say that the whole is either apart from or a part of that which it unifies: transcendent or immanent. A drive to unity is by design apart from what it unifies, and by default a part of it--both by nature. The State-form attempts to elevate the world to a level equal to its unifying abstraction, but in order to do so it must concretize itself enough to move brute matter. Every whole is immanent in its transcendence. Transcendence is nothing other than a particular mode of becoming-immanent to matter. 

We charted three drives to unity, three becomings-immanent. Two were subsumed by a proper name--"Qin Shih Huang-di," "Reagan"--the third by an impersonal apparatus--the Bush-thing. The first two we called heteronymic, the third apparatic. The becomings-immanent subsumed first and foremost by a name seized upon markers of excess as a way of conjuring away the impossibility of transcendence. They were obsessed with the body, whose potential for death and dismemberment is a material reminder of the failure awaiting. The tension between excess and the body worked into a frenzy involving spectacular disappearances, in the first case through a mythic quest for the other in the doubled self (the monster) and in the second case on a televised celebration of the fragmented self in the other (mass media technology)--ways of enacting the multiplicity unseen. The becoming-immanent subsumed first and foremost by an impersonal apparatus was haunted by its own premonitory signs of failure. It seized upon these, accepting the role of remainder. It melted to the point of imperceptibility on one screen apparatus only to reappear explosively on another. "Reagan" and the "First Emperor" played out the Emperor's conundrum by spinning off series of doubles and fracturings. The Bush-thing favored straddling a single split, enabling a decisive blankness where once was a proliferation of meaning and image. Each of these kinds of becoming-immanent, of course, involve names and apparatuses, myth and celebration, doubles, fractures, and splits, and many other things besides: an infinity of components. It is a question of composition, of how the components hold together. Determination is extrinsic: it is in interrelatedness.

There is at least one other kind of becoming-immanent (and probably many more): what we called nomadic desire. The difference between the becomings-immanent of the State Idea and the becomings-immanent of nomadic desire is not that between reason and unreason, or between constancy and passion. All becomings-immanent are desires, in the sense of tendings toward: they are drives or vectorial dynamisms inhabiting the in-between of bodies, images, ideas, and words, and many other things besides. The difference is that the State idea becomes-immanent in the service of unity, whereas nomadic desire openly embraces that singular multiplicity its State nemesis admits only under duress, like a dirty secret.



3. First and Last. The repetitive difference of the State Idea means that its every incarnation is in a sense immortal--or always already dead. Take your pick. It could be argued that Ronald Reagan was already present at the foundation of the Chinese empire, or that he is an avatar of the "First Emperor": that he has been alive since the dawn of history, or has died countless deaths, from fishly suicide to a failed assassination that in a sense succeeded because he walked away from it the corpse he already was. It always comes down to the same thing: equating the population with a bounded space or territory, saturating the territory with executive apparatuses, beaming onto every resulting surface projections of a despotic body whose form embodies an idea of unity as it disappears, shattered, into a dialectic of transcendence and immanence. The Bush-thing involves all of these components, but in a different mix. It takes one of them to the extreme: the apparatus (in one of its many variations). Bush has also been to China. The characteristically imperial apparatus--the bureaucracy--is an Asiatic Bush-thing with many an American cousin.



4. Alive and Unliving. The State-serving apparatus is the despotic expression of the impersonality of matter: the ordering voice of the "faceless" bureaucracy, the commanding might of the smart bomb's eyeless sight. The apparatus is matter that has been regimented as part of a becoming-immanent in the territory of the functions of the ruler, but which resists personification, in other words effective subsumption by a proper name. It is the inhumanity of the State, that which instrumentalizes State unity. Acting as the ruler's right hand without ceasing to be inorganic, the apparatus is an insistent remainder (excess) of absolute immanence. It is what the becoming-immanent of the ruler cannot entirely incorporate, but without which it cannot function. The ruler cannot act over a distance without the apparatus. Without it, his rule would not be the measure of the social field. 

Call this excessive remainder of absolute immanence force. Force is not material in the sense of being a determinate thing. And it is not necessarily negative, or prohibitive. In fact, its prohibitive mode is a special case, an exception to prove the rule, which is creative--productive of difference. For force is relational, it is the very stuff of relationality: non-coincidence, differential, vector, less a thing than matter and energy at their point of indiscernability.2 Perpetual motion: as soon as a force exerts itself it has become other than it is, because its exertion alters the relationality it was. Not only is force not determinate, it is not determinable: it is the very movement of determination. It is becoming. No ruler rules without making his person coincide with selected forces gathered into an apparatus. But force is becoming, unruly. The ruler becomes-immanent in the territory to the extent that he alienates himself in an inorganic life he cannot hope entirely to control.3 The organic model evoked directly or indirectly by every image of State unity functions only to the extent that it is a becoming-inorganic: yet another expression of the Emperor's conundrum. He effectively commands only to the degree to which he unlives his and others' lives.

The State Idea is always arriving, never abiding. In itself, it is outside time. It is eternal (or nonexistent, take your pick again). History lies in the alienation of the State Idea from itself: the apparatus is the history of the State. When we argued against evolutionary theories of social development, we said that the State and its transformations always arrived from outside, which we described as liminal, the in-between. That relational outside is the in-itself of force. The apparatus is an interiorization of force, its capture (regimentation, channelization) in the name of unity. Any capture leaves traces. As Foucault has shown, it is possible to use those traces to chart "genealogies" of institutions. It is possible to write history, but only if rupture is given precedence over continuity. 

The history of the State is the story of its progressive separation from itself through a proliferation and increasing differentiation of the apparatus. The only linearity in State history is this steady intensification of the becoming-immanent of the lost sovereign, the relentless "endocolonization" of the earth by materialized pre- and exhuman functions.4 The First Emperor had a restricted number of apparatuses at his disposal: the army, the mutual-spying machine, agriculture, hydraulics and other public works, all under the control of an overarching bureaucracy. Reagan had variations on all of these, plus many more. He made masterful use of spy apparatuses, using intelligence connections to make the famous pre-election arms-for-hostages deal that won him the presidency by thwarting a Carter "October surprise." Once in office, he could not have "healed the wounds of Vietnam" and prepared the nation for the infinite dissemination of his glorious image without ample support from such domestic apparatuses as the mass media and the police machine he mobilized for the "war" on drugs.

Two of the "First Emperor" apparatuses that have been hyperdeveloped under late capitalism are the army and the mutual-spying machine. Variations on each abound. Both are being technologized, relegating human perception and judgment step-by-step to the periphery of integrated circuits acting more and more automatically: poll responses relayed into computer analysis relayed into the mass media; satellite spy images relayed into computer analysis relayed into missile guidance systems. As human mental and perceptual functions are supplemented or even supplanted by technological translations of them, the leader and his subjects become increasingly peripheral to their own activities. The apparatus is expelling them. The human is less and less central, occupying instead the end-points of autonomic circuits: the human gives the poll response, and receives the results in the next day's paper; a human presses a button and a "soft target" blows up. It is the humans who are at the extremities of the apparatus, rather than the apparatus serving as the right hand of the exemplary human. Each autonomic circuit peripheralizes the human only in order to connect through that human end-point with itself, initiating its next operation cycle: the publicized poll results feed back into the next opinion poll, making or breaking a political career; satellite-gathered information on missile hits and misses feed back into the next push of the button and the next "soft target" blows. The space of human intervention is reduced to the minimum, to instant reflex action: a canned answer to a prepackaged question; a programmed gesture urgently responding to incoming information. 

The apparatus not only connects with itself at its human extremities; at those same points one autonomic circuit connects with another in a kind of asexual apparatic coupling: the results of successive polls are relayed into the military apparatus and launch the next war.

The human is expelled from the apparatus only to be incorporated all the more fully into it, as a relay point in increasingly integrated autonomic systems. Expelled as commander to be integrated as connector, the human is transformed by its own works from a brain legislating life to a ligament bindng machine cycles. Human rule ceases to be the measure of the universe as the human is adjoined to machinic processes capable of operating on scales infinitely smaller or larger than any single human being can comprehend or control: from despotic overcoding to cosmic adjunction. The human organism has been most successfully subsumed not in the overarching name of global unification, but by forms of inorganic life that can tap into cosmic energies, and limit human participation to local adjacency to them.5 Fittingly, the most advanced and publically appreciated apparatus of this kind is aimed at obliterating the human being it "services": the smart missile. Its nuclear kin marked the first recognized irruption in history of the exhuman apparatus. Nuclear weapons systems are a command-function materialization that descends into the infinitely small in order to release the infinitely large, in fatal form. The microchip is the "productive," or seductive-inductive, version of the same movement. As it continues its passage to infinity on the side of the small, it is inventing perception- and judgment-functions that may be released into the autonomic environment to be incorporated into infinitely expandable, but in principle sustainable, large-scale exhuman apparatuses (fuzzy logic, silicon neurons, virtual reality).6 Although the late capitalist State multiplies and intensifies army and spy machines, its trademark apparatuses are those specializing in perception- and judgment-functions applicable to civilian use as well: from the mass media to interactive media and associated technologies. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the State's multiplication and intensification of these machines may augur its own demise.

If the history of the State is the endocolonization of the earth by the apparatus, that history may be coming to an end as exhuman functions proliferate-differentiate in every domain. Although Bush hasn't brought his thing back home yet in a big way, his repeated promise to mobilize the army to fight the "war" against drugs alongside already highly techo-militarized police forces shows that there are strong pressures to expand even the most unapologetic command apparatuses on the domestic front. If army, police, spy machines and their derivatives continue to automate and interlink, joining already interconnecting apparatuses such as marketing research, "information economy" financial circuits of all kinds, and the mass media, forming a horizontal net of increasingly complex autonomic response capabilities, the point will be reached when the vertical dimension proper to the State's overarching drive to unity becomes superfluous. This would not, however, mean an end to power. Power is captured force, apparatically applied. The importance of despotic command--the function proper to the State-form--would recede in favor of posthuman social control. While it would mark the end of human sovereignty, it would not be the end of power; it would be a new form of power, perhaps more effective than any yet seen. What are currently State apparatuses might retain a key role, acting collectively as something approaching a central processing unit, a machinic node coordinating capitalized autonomic processes, adjusting them to one another, mediating conflicts, maximizing profit. But this would be an immanent formation, a coordinator of heterogeneous horizontal movements on the plane of capital, rather than a structuring unity projecting its image onto the social field from a higher plane all its own.7 It would not be a State in our sense. The wave of social and economic deregulation sweeping the Western nation-states since the early 1980s coupled with the development of transnational trade zones in the 1990s (the European Community, the North American Free Trade Zone, the Yen bloc, and the Commonwealth of Independent States replacing the old Soviet Union) represent strong tendencies in this direction. 

Then again, all that may never happen. In fact the opposite could well be the case: the new mania of State formation convulsing the world could be the State's last desperate gasp, or yet another rebirth. It would seem that the United States faces several choices: follow the Bush-thing as it jogs farther and farther into the proliferating-differentiating apparatus and away from the State as we have known it; or rehumanize. Rehumanization would consist in forcing the population, the territory, and the executive apparatus back into a content-laden homology with the body of the leader, resubsuming the "spirit" of the nation under the proud name of organic unity. This way leads back to the liberal "representative" democracy of the 1960s and 1970s, on to a "Reagan" third term, or toward the invention of an all-American fascism (with the likes of Jesse Helms and David Duke in the vanguard), depending on how vigorously the homology is forced. Unsavory options all. Where the option of following the apparatus may lead is a complete unknown.



5. Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter. We noted a symbiosis between the masculine gender and the State-form. Despotism itself seemed best defined as privileging of maleness in collective symbolization and the preeminence of the masculine voice in collective ideation. We used the term symbiosis, and referred to the masculinity of the despot as a kind of home base to which his imagings and discourse, his vocal and visual bodily residues, return more often than not. These were ways of saying that the men and despotism go together almost without exception, that they belong with and to each other, but that this is more a complicity than the result of a shared essence: the relation between men and despotism is extrinsically determined. In other words, it is not a destiny. Bush's self-neutering in technology attests to that.

Or does it? How can we ignore the phallic resonance of the "short bursts of mute projectile motion" that make the Bush-thing most at one with himself? We can't. No matter how materialized, how inorganic, how neuter the Bush-thing is, it is still at least residually masculine, if only on one side of the split, on another screen belonging to a different apparatus than the missile (the mass media). And in the missile itself, it could be argued that masculinity is much more than residual. The command-function materialized so expertly in the missile is a splitting image of the idea of unity--and it is precisely the drive to unity that holds men and despotism together. The dynamic of unity is the playing out of their belonging together, it is their symbiosis, their interrelatedness, their combined force. The Bush-thing can be seen as masculinity's latest ruse: shed the despotic body as a strategy for preserving its driving Idea. Inorganic masculinity: the despot's last laugh.

Any counterstrategy to the Bush-thing based on a becoming-woman would short-circuit. The feminine is as much a part of the masculine system as the neuter. None of these terms have any meaning apart from the others. The masculine is the historically predominant human expression of the excess of transcendence (the phallus). The feminine is the historically predominant human expression of the remainder of immanence (castration). The neuter is the reversal point or the vanishing point of human transcendence and immanence: it is the point toward which the irresolvable dialectic of transcendence and immanence set in motion by the drive to unity leads, as if to its solution. But it is not the solution, only the human point of contradiction. If masculinity is the phallus, and femininity is castration, then the neuter is the cut of the knife, the blast of the missile. Masculine, feminine, and neuter are all part of the same system: the personified organism. If a body precipitates toward one of these terms, it inevitably carries one or both of the others with it, eventually rebecoming what it left, or being assailed by it, haunted by it at every turn. As long as there is personification and organism, there will be gender, and where there is gender, there is masculinity, and where there is masculinity, there is almost certainly a despotic body ready for launch. A further indication that the belonging-together of men and despotism is symbiotic rather than essential is the fact that a biologically female body can sometimes serve as the launch site. The Kuwaitis are building a museum for Margaret Thatcher--European "Reagan" turned tireless Bush-thing champion--to immortalize her pro-war activism.

The personified organism, the human, is always again a creature of the State. Gender-based subjectivity (Oedipus in its many incarnations) is a miniaturization, to fit the contours of the human body, of the transcendence-immanence dialectic constituting the State. 

We have argued against privileging phallic interpretations of every cut, split, and fracture. That is because excess, remainder, and contradiction can be and are imaged in many other ways than by gender. Every level in the State system of homologies has its own way of imaging the immanence-transcendence dialectic. Insisting on reducing them to the phallus robs them of their specificity. The disappearing Emperor is a phallus, but he is also an emperor. The decapitated head is a phallus, but one that formerly wore a hat. Once again, it is less a question of is than of composition, of how a multiplicity of components hold together while retaining their singularity and separate histories.

If the personified organism is a creature of the State, and the State forever arrives and returns to a transhistorical place that cannot be located, then so does gender. Gender is an imaging and discourse system, a system of symbolizations and ideations driven by a dynamic that is in itself utterly impersonal, inorganic. The "body without an image" is an oxymoron expressing this inherence of the impersonal and inorganic in the human. "Virtual kinetic geography" is another term for it, one playing on a different level of the State system of homologies, that of the territory. The Bush-thing's privileging of the neuter, alongside of if not at the expense of the masculine, indicates that the body-State system is returning more intensely than ever to the body without an image, approaching ever closer to the inherence of the material, to absolute immanence. It cannot go any further without flipping over into a different dynamic altogether, in which the impersonal and the inorganic completely subsume the human. In the preceding section, we speculated about one such dynamic, assuming a radicalization of transnational capitalism whereby profit eclipsed unity once and for all as the motor of social control. What is important in the present context is that the point of reversal--where the State (in this case, capital-technocratic) shades into the nomadic extreme (the first to inhabit a primarily technological smooth space)--also marks the limit of gender, patriarchy, all fixed hierarchy. That limit is less the neuter than the perpetual underside of the masculine, feminine, and neuter together, that from which they arise and into which they subside, not yet and again. Like the State, it ever arrives. But never before like this. The human is haunted by the masculine, which is possessed of the despot. But the despot is possessed of the body without an image, beckoned by it with growing insistence toward a non-place where no power abides. It is in the same movement that humanity passes to the limit of its own subjection, glimpses a new servitude, and is beckoned by its liberation.



6. Force and Potential. If apparatuses operate by capturing or interiorizing force, and if the relational outside is the in-itself of force, then the apparatus, in interiorizing force, alienates force from itself. Force = unbounded relationality = infinite connectability = pure potential: the capture of force is the reduction of potential. There is a reciprocal history to the State's progressive separation from itself through a proliferation and increasing differentiation of the apparatus: an equally complex separation of force from potential. What we called power. The actions of the State foster the crystalization of power, what Lord Shang praised as the "elimination of strength": regimentation, channelization, induction. Walls and roads, functionalized things and allegedly harmonious movement of bodies, utility and organism: these are power phenomena, left-overs of force, post-capture. They are remainders of unspent potential, traces of unknown excess, hieroglyphs of an unreadable history of rupture shadowing, shattering the continuities of State-crystalized powers, whose linearized histories they also write, in the same words, different language.8

If the interiorization of force reached the limit of endocolonization, the point at which the State flips over into its own underside, if it spun out into a smooth, unbounded space of exterioriy, if it actualized immanence in horizontal networks of increasingly complex interrelation . . . Could it not be made an occasion to sidestep power rather than resubmitting to it in a new way? Could the demise of the despot be taken as an opportunity to retranslate force into potential?


7. Anti-State. We can't offer any conclusions, in the sense of final solutions. Those we leave to men of State. We can only offer a desire, counter to theirs. We can only incant: don't turn back. Call the Bush-thing's bluff. Take the drive to unity out of the missile, and the missile out of the apparatus. Do not jog. Take the remnants of self out of machinic possession. Refind "one's" strength. Return force to potential, remainder to excess, history to its underside. As the failure of Enlightenment has shown, liberation is never of the human, it is only ever from it. Invoke the body without an image in a postgender, posthuman, sovereignless world--even in the uncertainty of where it will take us. One thing is certain: we won't have "Reagan" to reassassinate anymore.﻿




PART 1
The Inmost End

The hypothesis of a calculable future leads to a wrong interpretation of the principles of behaviour which the need for action compels us to adopt, and to an underestimation of the concealed factors of utter doubt, precariousness, hope and fear.
								  —John Maynard Keynes (1973, 122)


We are enjoined to rational choice. We are taught that our freedom is one with the freedom of choice. We are told we become who we are by how we choose. We are assured that if we choose well, according to our own best interests, we will end up serving the interests of all. We are told that there is a mechanism in place to ensure this convergence between our interests and others'. Market is its name. Its "invisible hand" adjusts best choices to each other, its magic touch guided by the principle of competition. Competition weeds out suboptimal choices, selecting for efficiency. Efficiencies multiply each other, minimizing effort and maximizing profit for all. The market, we are further led to believe, is self-regulating. It has a natural inclination toward optimization. As political subjects, we are enjoined to vote, rationally, in its interests so that we may pursue our own, for the general good. Rationally, the political subject coincides with the economic subject of self-interest that we all are fundamentally, in our private pursuit of happiness. And what, if not that, gives meaning and motivation to our lives? We are all paying guests at the tea party of choice, spreading our favorite jam on our very own slice of the bread of life, served on the silver platter of efficiency by the invisible hand.

But on closer inspection, a rabbit-hole appears at the heart of the market. It plummets from the apparently solid ground of rational choice to a wonderland where nothing appears the same. Affect is its name. The "concealed factors" of doubt, precariousness, hope, and fear—and why not?, love, friendship, and joy—tend to bubble back up to the surface with rowdy abandon. In today's version of free-market ideology, neoliberalism, the affective commotion has become so insistent that something else surfaces as well: the creeping suspicion that it is upon the groundless ground of these now not-so-concealed factors that the edifice of the economy is actually built. Efficiencies, we are still assured, multiply each other. They lasso each other, bootstrapping the economy out of its periodic crises into a provisionally stable order that we are still entreated to consider rational. But when markets react more like mood rings than self-steering wheels, the affective factor becomes increasingly impossible to factor out. It becomes obvious that the "rationality" of the economy is a precarious art of snatching emergent order out of affect. The creeping suspicion is that the economy is best understood as a division of the affective arts.

The implications of this groundless grounding in affective artistry are worth a look, not least for what it might say about "rational" self-interest as the guarantor of self-optimizing order, but also for the rethinking it might necessitate of the very concept of the rational in its relation to affect. Michel Foucault provides a provocative starting point in his 1979 lessons on the genealogy of neoliberalism (Foucault 2008).

The Market in Wonderland

The "invisible hand" makes at least a cameo appearance in every discussion of the free market. Foucault's is no exception. As its inventor Adam Smith conceived it, Foucault argues, the concept of the invisible hand had nothing of the God-like quality that has come to be attributed to it. The whole point of the concept was that the economic system is too churningly complex for there to be any possibility of a lordly overview upon it. In his genealogy of neoliberalism, Foucault makes the point in no uncertain terms: when it comes to things economic, there is no "total transparency" (Foucault 2008, 279). Not only is there no total transparency—there is no transparency or totality. The concept of the invisible hand, as Foucault interprets it, is a principle of blindness in an open field of ceaseless activity whose contours, always shifting, are by nature indefinite. "Being in the dark and the blindness of all the economic agents is an absolute necessity" (297). 

For neoliberals, this is actually a good thing: it makes economic liberalism unavoidable. It means that the economy can have no sovereign. The invisible hand actually means "hands off." The liberal's principle of laissez-faire, Foucault quips, becomes for the neoliberals "do-not-laisser-faire government": tie the government's hands (Foucault 2008, 247). Foucault is quick to add that in practice neoliberalism entails a large and even expanding range of forms of governmental intervention. But these are designed, paradoxically, to maintain the ability of market mechnisms to self-organize the economy free from undue government interference (Foucault 2008, 175-176). They do not operate from a position of sovereign command. They are  in the midst.  Any governmental attempt from on high to weave the strands together into a well-defined, predictably regulated whole will just fray the fabric to the ripping point. Government purports to act all-knowingly in the general interest, and in its hybris always fumbles. Individuals, too, are under the injunction, in the name off the general good, to act without regard for it. For it is only then that the "invisible hand" can work. 

But it's not a hand at all. It's an accumulation of little-handed decisions which end up serving the general good in spite of being self-interested. Individual decisions, made in the darkness of self-interest, percolate through the field. To the extent that the results of these decisions form positive feedback loops, they give rise to mutually beneficial multiplier effects and there occurs a "spontaneous synthesis" of what's best for all (Foucault 2008, 300). The synthesis is entirely involuntary with regard to each individual (275-276). This "rationalization" of the economy to which the subject of interest's decisions involuntarily contributes is an emergent property of a complex, self-organizing system: a novelty and a creation, forever self-renewing. The synthesis, Foucault continues, is a "positive effect" of an "infinite number" of "accidents" occurring ground-level in the "apparent chaos" (277), or quasi-chaos, of the market environment. These are bound together by a "directly multiplying mechanism" — competition — which, Foucault emphasizes, operates in the absence of any form of transcendence (275-276). In other words, the positive synthesis of market conditions occurs immanently to the economic field. The choice of the subject of self-interest rabbit-holed in that field of immanence is "irreducible" and "nontransferable" (272). It is "unconditionally referred to the subject himself" (272). At its core, Foucault says, the liberal economic model is one of "existence itself": it concerns first and foremost a relation of the "individual to himself" (242). 

This is existence in its dissociative dimension. Here, in its relation to itself, the subject circles itself more and more tightly around its individual power of choice, like a dog to sleep, wrapping itself centripetally around a center of promised satisfaction. It circles in on itself, away from the social, unmindful of noneconomic societal logics. But it all works out to the best for society in the end, they say, thanks to the postive synthesis of multiplier effects. Relation to oneself involuntarily amplifies across the multiplier effects to become a system-wide social fact. The inmost dimensions of individual existence are operatively linked to the most encompassing level, that of the market environment that is the economic field of life. What is most intensely individual is at the same time most wide-rangingly social. THE SMALLEST SCALE AND THE LARGEST SCALE RESONATE AS ONE, IN A QUASI-CHAOS OF MUTUAL SENSITIVITY. TO RELATE SELF-INTERESTEDLY TO ONESELF IS IN THE VERY SAME ACT TO RELATE, INVOLUNTARILY, TO EVERYONE ELSE. 

But there is a problem. It has to do with the future. Success, of course, is not guaranteed for any particular act, or any particular individual. The self-organizing of the system at the largest scale can synthesize its way past many a micro-failure. As choices percolate through the economic field, the negative impact of individual failures is compensated for oveall by the multiplier effects of the successes. Given the infinitely of accidents riddling the economic field of life and the existential blindness of all economic actors, there is an ever-present threat of a misstep. Every economic calculation is a calculus of risk. "Behavioral finance (psychology) and rational actor models (the 'rational economic man', or REM) rarely emphasize how UNCERTAINTY differs from RISK AND PROBABILITY" (Pixley 2004, 18). You can calculate risk in terms of probabilities, but probabilities by nature have nothing to say about any given case. The affect accompanying uncertainty is there, in any case. Choices in the present become highly charged affectively with fear for the uncertain future. The present is shaken, tremulous with futurity. There is no calculus of risk independent of an individual's affective self-relation to uncertainty. 

Even in the best-case scenario, rationality and affectivity cannot be held safely apart. Unlike the juridical subject of the law and the civil subject of society, the economic subject of interest is never called upon to renounce its self-interest for the general good. Self-interestedness remains "unconditional." It is measured in SATISFACTION. We have been successful in our self-interestedness if we have attained satisfaction for ourselves. What the economically productive subject of interest ultimately produces is its own satisfaction (Foucault 2008, 226). Paradoxically, the measure of HOW "RATIONALLY" A SUBJECT OF INTEREST BEHAVES CAN ONLY BE MEASURED AFFECTIVELY, in the currency of satisfaction. Rationality and affectivity are joined at the self-interested hip, in one way or another, for better and for worse. "Emotions function in the core structures of the financial world" (Pixley 2004, 18).

The subject of interest is never called upon to renounce self-interest. But it is frequently called upon to defer the very satisfaction by which its self-interest is measured. Feeling insecure? Be reasonable. Defer your satisfaction to a more secure time of life. Work toward retirement. But this is only a rational choice if you trust the system's self-organizing. This is an increasingly difficult sell as crises follow each other in rapid succession. Each crisis is a shock to the system, at all scales. Uncertainty starts to feed on uncertainty. Fear builds into panic. Negative multiplier effects take over. Household savings vaporize and national economies crumble. Suspicions grow that the invisible hand suffers from a degenerative motor disease. 

All signs are that the condition is congenital. Crisis no longer seems a punctual  interval between between periods of stability. Crisis is the new normal. That this should be the case only stands to reason. The premise of any rational calculation is that similarly strategized actions will yield similar results. But the whole point of an economy that selects for creative multiplier effects is that multiplier effects are nonlinear. By definition, they are effects that are not commensurate with their causes, even if the causes be known. The whole point of capitalist enterprise is to "leverage": to extract a surplus yield of effect over and above what would normally be expected to follow from an investment. The capitalist process is driven by the potential for, and yearning after, AN EXCESS OF EFFECT over any given quantity of causative input: SURPLUS-VALUE. The more complex the system is, the more uncertain the future becomes. And complexification has been a constitutive tendency of the capitalist system from its beginnings. Capitalism has always been a far-from-equilibrium system, becoming ever more so. The same multiplier mechanism that promises future satisfaction makes it exponentially less certain.

Why defer satisfaction if the capitalist future is constitutively uncertain? But on the other hand, how can you not play it safe by deferring your satisfaction, precisely because the capitalist future is so uncertain? This conundrum of deferral is an expression of the paradox that neoliberalism's promise of satisfaction unnerves the rationality it extols, giving it the affective shakes that cannot be cured. The rational risk calculations of the subject of interest become more and more affectively overdetermined by the tension between fear of the future and hope for success, and between satisfaction and its uncertain deferral. The embrace of rational self-interest and affective agitation becomes all the closer. They fall all the more intensely into each other's orbit, to the point that they contract into each other, entering into a ZONE OF INDISTINCTION, at the heart of every act. 

It's a vicious circle. Positive multiplier effects can be counted on only when individuals' rational choices mutually reinforce each other, catching like a contagion. This is the point at which rational choice is indistinguishable from "irrational exuberance" (in the legendary phrase of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan). This is also precisely the mechanism that forms speculative bubbles leading to crisis. More radical than the fact that the same mechanism that promises satisfaction makes it exponentially less certain is the fact the attainment of the very satisfaction promised can itself bring on a crisis. The tired hound of self-interest, circling in for satisfaction, traces its own private vicious circle in its self-relating movements. Its sleep will be agitated. It will twitch with dreams of disappearing rabbits.

System Distrust

In times of crisis, the first words out of the mouth of any economic leader are: "we must restore trust in the system." But as systems theorist Niklas Luhmann blithely observed, under these endemic conditions "trust rests on an illusion" (Luhmann 1979, 32). In a chaotic economic field personal relations of trust are impossible to guarantee. "In actuality, there is less information available than would be required to give assurance of success" (32). "Linear causal explanations come to grief" (83). However well-intentioned the other party may be, they cannot be trusted. The nonlinear dynamics of the economy could well frustrate their best intentions. What's an enterprise system to do? 

If relying on personal bonds of trust is out of the question, there only one option: "depersonalize" trust." Make it "impersonal" (Lumann 1979, 93). Entrust the system. "System trust" is the only answer. But how does an individual trust a system that doesn't trust itself to follow its own line? "There must be other ways of building up trust which do not depend on the personal element. But what are they?" (46). Luhmann has an ingenious answer to his own question. You actually "SHIFT FORWARD THE THRESHOLD OF EFFECTIVE DISTRUST" (75). IN OTHER WORDS, YOU FOSTER DISTRUST AS A STARTING CONDITION (88). YOU FOSTER DISTRUST, BUT NOT AS THE OPPOSITE OF TRUST: AS ITS "FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT" (71). 

What on earth does that mean? It means that you "interlock them so that they intensify each other" (Luhmann 1979, 92). You bring trust and distrust together into a zone of indistinction where they are in such immediate proximity to each other that one can easily tip into the other at the slightest agitation. They resonate together, intensely.

As actions are taken, the resulting affective state of the individual oscillates between them. Foucault notes that the "horizon" of the neoliberal field of life is one of increasing differentiation that is constitutively open to "oscillatory processes" (2008, 259).6 By differentiation, he is referring to capitalist society's overspilling of disciplinary modes of power based on normative models imposed on the individual, and the accompanying proliferation of "minority practices" (259). When he mentions oscillatory processes he is talking about the fluctuation of economic indicators such as salaries, job creation figures, industrial orders, and most fundamentally prices, which mark the ups and downs of the system's self-regulatory mechanisms. But the same description applies equally well to the smallest unit of the economy, the enterprising individual, as it does to the system as a whole. On the individual level, trust and distruct interlock and intensify each other, resonating together in immediate proximity, forming their own oscillatory system. As do fear and hope, satisfaction and self-denial, all in it together.

The individual subject of interest forming the fundamental unit of capitalist society is internally differentiated, containing its own population of "minority practices" of contrasting affective tone and tenor, in a zone of indistinction between rational calculation and affectivity. In other words, there is an INFRA-INDIVIDUAL COMPLEXITY quasi-chaotically agitating within the smallest unit. The individual remains the smallest unit despite this infra-level complexity, because what resonates on that level are not separable elements in interaction. They are intensive elements, in intra-action (Barad 2007, 33). They are IMMEDIATELY LINKED VARIATIONS, held in tension, resonating together in immediate proximity. Their oscillatory co-motion expresses itself at the level of the individual, where it is marked by fluctuating indicators, just as the actions of individual economic actors express themselves on the systemic level in fluctuating indicators such as prices. We call the indicators of the intra-action occuring on the infra-individual level moods. "Moods," Gilbert Ryle writes, are like "the weather, temporary conditions which in a certain way collect occurrences, but they are not themselves extra occurrences" ((CONDITIONS, INFRA-EMPIRICAL)) (Ryle 1949, 83). Moods collect infra-occurrences and sum them up in a general orientation giving direction to the next level up, just as price fluctuations collect the micro-economic decisions of individual actors and sum them up in the general orientation of the economy as a whole.

This means that we need to add a whole new dimension to economic thinking. Beneath the MICRO-ECONOMIC level of the individual there is the INFRA-ECONOMIC LEVEL. At that level, an affective commotion intra-churns. Its variations are so immediately linked that we cannot parse them out into separate occurrences. The individual, speaking infra-ly, is not one. It may collect itself as one. It may figure as one, for higher levels. But in itself, it is many. Many TENDENCIES: potential expressions and orientations held together in tension. Buffeted by these tendencies' coming turbulently together, divided among them in its relation to itself. Divided among them, awaiting their complex playing out in a shift in general orientation, the "individual" is the DIVIDUAL (Deleuze 1995, 180). The dividual is the individual as affective infra-climate, in relation to itself, commotionally poised for what may come, storm or shine, doldrums or halcyon days.

Nothing divides and multiplies the individual so much as its own relation to the FUTURE.

The uncertainty is not just external, relating to accidents and the unpredictable actions of others. It agitates within. Even if you play it as safe as possible by deferring a decision until sunnier days to come, all you have done is find another way to increase uncertainty: now it is not just others' decisions that are unknown to you, but your own as well. "These unknown nondecisions recur endlessly" (Pixley 2004, 33). Who knows what will possess you to decide when to decide, or what you will decide when you do? You don't know your future self yet. You are infra-buffeted by your own unworked-out tendencies awaiting a complex playing out that is as likely to surprise you yourself as any stranger. Weather forecasting is as unpredictable in the infra-climate of the (in)dividual as at other scales.

The affective infra-climate of the dividual poised for what may come is the rabbit-hole of the economy. The unknown nondecisions and not-quite-occurrences recurring endlessly in a turbulence of tendency are complex in the same way as the economy as a whole. Both are like the weather, quasi-chaotic self-organizing systems. This puts a whole new perspective on "rational" choice. The individual, Foucault said, is unconditionally referred to itself, and this referral is irreducible and nontransferable. This means that rational decision is unconditionally, irreducibly, nontransferably refered to an infra-individual zone of indistinction with affect. RATIONALITY AND AFFECT BECOME "FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENTS" by Luhmann's definition: interlocked and mutually intensifying, in a zone of indistinction, at the "forward threshold" of economic existence.

Luhmann's analysis of trust posits that this infra-level of individual complexity is directly connected to the collective, macro-level of the economic, without necessarily passing through the MEDIATION of the intervening micro-economic level at which the individual is but one. It is a defining characteristic of complex environment that THE EXTREMES OF SCALE ARE SENSITIVE TO EACH OTHER, ATTUNED TO EACH OTHER'S MODULATIONS. This is what makes them oscillatory. They can perturb each other. System-wide changes in the weather are sure to resonate at the infra-level, for example in a localized patch of fog. Perturbations channeling back up from the infra-level are apt to amplify into multiplier effects. Think of the way a local fog can amplify into a mega-traffic jam. The individual blindness of the subject of interest is the fog of the economy. When multiplier effects channel upward, the individual is not mediating between the levels in any conventional sense. Self-organizing effects channel through the individual level on their infra-way to larger things. The individual is an amplifier mechanism for multiplier-effects' self-forming. It channels the threshold noise of the system—the functional indistinction between rational calculation and affective response—into an emergent economic ordering that is as ever-changing and continually self-renewing as the winds. In a very real sense, the infra-individual is the crucible of the system. 

When Foucault says that the individual's choice is irreducible, he can only mean that the individual's tendential dividedness in relation to itself is irreducible. The dividual is irreducible. The infra- of the individual is irreducible, in the sense that when system-wide perturbations blow down its hole they can go no further. They have nowhere else to go but to turn around and blow back out. The economy ends in the recesses of the infra-individual, which as Foucault said is not only irreducible but nontransferable. What is nontransferable is inexchangeable. At the infra-individual level, the possibility of exchange comes to an end. If the economy is defined by exchange, then the economy ends in the recesses of the infra-individual. It reaches a limit, as a function of which it is organized—but which lies outside its logic. Foucault speaks of this affective infra-level as the "REGRESSIVE ENDPOINT" of the economy (Foucault 2008, 272).

The infra-individual is the regreessive—recessive or immanent—endpoint of the economy. The dividual is the non-economic wonderland of intense and stormy life on the brink of action that lies at the heart of the economy: its absolute immanent limit. Endpoint—and turnaround. It is only ever possible to approach an absolute limit. The movement toward the endpoint of the economy either disappears into its own infinite regress, or turns itself around into a movement of return.

Collapse of the Affective Wave-Packet

Returning to Luhmann's analytic of trust, to say that trust and distrust resonate together in a zone of indistinction of immediate oscillatory proximity to each other means that what is felt in the lead-up to an economic act, as it is brinking, is neither one nor the other, neither trust nor distrust. Luhmann says that what is felt is a "readiness" to feel either come next (Luhmann 1979, 79). The individual is in an infra-state of READINESS POTENTIAL. Trust and distrust are together as co-present potentials for what might come next. They are in SUPERPOSITION, in the sense in which the word is used in quantum physics. Though inseparable, their distinction is not erased. It is held in ready reserve. 

The affective feeling of the readiness potential, Luhmann continues, presupposes a "corresponding reserve of energy which is elsewhere not determined" (Luhmann 1979, 80). In other words, the system itself, because it is similarly complex and nonlinear, is in an energized state of readiness potential that is structured in a fashion homologous the subject's affective state. The economy is ready and "responsive," poised like its individual units, for what may come, in a state of brinking agitation. On the infra-level, the brinking is a superposition of trust and distrust in readiness potential. On the macroeconomic level, what is held in readiness potential are the system states of SUCCESS OR FAILURE. At the moment a given choice is made, the success or failure of that action is "undetermined elsewhere." Which way it will go will depend on actions still in tendency, as yet undecided. The economic outcome depends on how these tendencies' expressions will inflect and amplify each other as they turbulently play out across the economic field in a cascade of caroming choices. When this self-organizing process works itself out, the cumulative effects will be "collected" and "summed up" in a system indicator. Until the "mood" of the economy comes to expression in this way, success and failure will remain in a state of superposition—as will trust and distrust at the individual level. The affective states of trust and distrust and the system states of success and failure lie at the two oscillatory poles of the economic process. They are sensitive to each other. They reciprocally determine each other, effectively connecting across their differences of nature and the distance between levels through a complex, nonlinear process of feedback and feedforward. 

Under these conditions the subject of interest is not in a position to know how any given act it takes will turn out. But it cannot not act. You can only defer so long, or so much, and only in certain areas of your activity. Any act you perform triggers the process leading to a resolution of the commotion of affective states held complexly together in tension on the infraindividual readiness potential into a determinable outcome registrable in terms of success or failure. In short, making a choice leads to the collapse of the superposition of affective states. To borrow the vocabulary of quantum physics, it collapses the affective wave-packet. A particle of trust or distrust spins off into the world, where it will PERTURB the infraindividual complexity of other (in)dividuals poising for action. Again like quantum physics, the causality is recursive. The determination of what the act will effectively have been, which state it will be found to have been in, is in suspense until a measurement is made. The measurement makes what comes, what it will have been. Until then, what has occurred is less an act or a choice than an as yet unresolved perturbation. The perturbation must percolate up to the level at which it is collected and bundled into overall economic indicators before it can be determined. Figures are released monthly, and in the case of the most affectively weighted and eagerly awaited, quarterly. In the meantime, particular indicators, such as the stock market or the price of oil, fluctuate continuously like the batting of tiny butterfly wings. Now with the internet, the fluctuations can be followed minute by minute, or even second by second. Without the quarterly indicators to contextualize them, extrapolating a trend from this passing economic wing-batting is highly conjectural, to say the least. Extra-economic events can spook investors and consumers, such as a political crisis in an oil-producing region of the world. These extra-economic perturbations are all the more affecting in anticipation. The uncertainty of these so-called "negative externalities" occurring, and what their exact fall-out will be if they do occur, sends shivers through the system. The shivers almost instantaneously amplify into a low-grade fever that may prove at any moment to have been the onset of a chronic illness. The system is a continual state of pathological excitability, if not because of the publication of new indicators, then in the intervals between them, in the urgency of the feeling of the need to respond to trends BEFORE THEY EMERGE onto a macro-enough level and are tidily summed up in the indicators. 

To act on threats before they emerge was the Bush administration's definition of PREEMPTION (Massumi 2007). The economy is continually agitated by the affectively fraught, felt need to preempt it. As the neoliberal economy takes hold, deferral becomes less and less of an option and preemptive action more and more of an imperative.8 This make economy more affectively ACTIVATING than it is effectively rationalizing. It runs more on perturbations and cascading amplifications than determinate acts of choice.

As this state of affective agitation heightens, what economic actors often end up reacting to most directly are the agitated affective states of other actors. This has given rise to a whole new service industry, that of "internet mood analysis." The internet is trawled by algorithms that search out affectively laden words and terminology to provide a real-time pulse-taking of the mood of the economy. These services go by such names as "AlmagaMood," whose catchy slogan is "Leveraging Big Data to Enhance Investment Foresight."9 It is not just economic sites that are mood-mined. It is the entire internet, including blogs, news sites, and the expanding Twitterverse. The economy as a whole vibrates with the fickleness of what the pundits call "social mood." This internet-based mood registering occurs informally through the social media and all manner of networking. In our networked society, with the global media reach and cross-platform convergence of the internet, any act anywhere resonates, potentially, everywhere, in the economic analogue of Einstein's "spooky" action at a distance. Readiness-potential wave-packets collapse, affectively-systemically, in real-time (or its functional internet equivalent). Individual actions are AFFECTIVELY ENTANGLED AT A DISTANCE. It is only the complex playing-out of the entanglements that decides in the end what will have been a success and what a failure. Complexly correlated to each quantum of success or failure, there will come to expression  determinate affective states of trust or distrust, satisfaction or frustration.

Individual economic actors are infra-connected. They are connected at a distance, in the recesses of their affective rabbit-holes. They communicate at a distance, in immanent affective proximity, churning in and turning around the regressive endpoints of their respective (in)dividualities. THE INFRA-LEVEL RESONATES TRANSINDIVIDUALLY. Individuals spook each other or goad each other on, turning around what is nontransferable in them as individuals: their infra-individual affective commotion. They resonate, at the limit of the economy, in their dividuality. As they reciprocally perturb each other, their readiness-potential wave-packet collapses, correlated transindividually at a distance. Quanta of trust and distrust fly off in all directions. These affective emissions feed up into macro-level expressions of economic success or failure, which no sooner feed back down from the systems macro level into the affective infra-fray. 

Given the cross-sensitivity between scales, at the limit the economic system and the subject of interest are themselves in a functional state of indistinction. The whole system is always going down the rabbit-hole. It is just as continually reemerging, through multiplier effects, channeled through affectively-inflected individual actions, back onto its own level. It does not make the trip to its own regressive endpoint and back unchanged. It becomes en route. It addition to the economic SYSTEM—the precarious emergent orderings of the economy as more or less regulated by macroeconomic market mechanisms, and as more or less analyzable using quantitative indicators—there is the chaotic PROCESS of this back-and-forth between levels from which economic determinations periodically emerge.10 The process as a whole is neither governable nor quantifiable. It is AFFECTIVE-RELATIONAL. Given the paradoxical bond between the affectivity of the relational process and the troubled rationality of its emergent orderings, the system that is the sum of the orderings is at best metastable: precariously stable, tottering between bouts of system equilibrium-loss and processual vertigo.

Each dizzy individual's rabbit-hole of affect is at the immanent limit of the economy. The multitude of these regressive endpoints "communicate," entangled at distance. Their transindividual entanglement composes what Deleuze and Guattari would call the "PLANE OF IMMANENCE" OF THE ECONOMY. The plane of immanence of the economy is the irreducibly affective limit of a complexly relational field. It is the economy at its absolute co-motional limit of tendential stirrings in uncertain readiness potential.

On the plane of immanence, the economic system and the subject of interest are jointly in potential, in a functional state of indistinction at the level at which action is just beginning to stir, in the INCIPIENCE of what is to come. The symmetry between the infra-individual and the economic field as a whole, across their difference in scale, is only apparent. The infra-level is in a very real sense the larger of the two, in that it germinally includes the relation between levels, at the immanent limit. Entangled in the zone of indistinction of readiness potential, the subject and the system come together, to become together. Every little act turning out from the regressive endpoint ollapses the wave packet, destroying the infra-state of functional indistinction. The commotion on the infra-individual level acts out. It is then registered as an indexable occurrence, summing up the individual's irreducible and nontransferable relation to itself in an economically significant act. Through the registering of the action, discernible levels bounce back into place. Scales accordion back out. The system re-self-organizes out of its processual rabbit-holing.

The individual's self-relation, in the "dissociative" dividual dimension, is the crucible of the system's integral self-organizing. Each little act helps inflect the system's global direction, as the economy bootstraps its future on the fly. The system's future is also each individual's future, as it navigates a life journey through economic successes and failures. The system and its denizens become in tandem. Every little act exerts a quantum of creative power, globally and locally, in accordion-playing correlation. Every little choice exerts, to some degree, a power of local-global becoming: an ONTOPOWER. What has been lost to the system and to individuals in terms of knowablility, calculability, and predictability, is regained in resonant ontopower. An ontopower, as a power of becoming, is a creative power. The economic model, Foucault said, is now one of existence itself. Existence itself: where being is becoming.

When what is created is a state of system trust, Luhmann emphasizes that the trust is entirely "unjustified" (Luhmann 1979, 78). It may be rationalizable after the fact, but in its genesis it is rationally unfounded. It did not occur as the separate result of a rational decision judiciously preceding the actions that brought it into being. It came flush with an affective regress, and its turn-about playing-out. At the limit, all economic acts are rationally ungrounded in the endpoint of the economy. This does not mean that they are affectively grounded there. Any state of system-trust that emerges is just as affectively unjustified as it is rationally unjustified. It was not grounded in anything preparatory to action that could be qualified as in any way trustworthy. The transactions that worked out well and led to success proved themselves trustworthy. They became trustworthy, as a function of how they played out. The state of system trust is effectively self-justifying. It "justifies itself," Luhmann writes, in the way that it has "become creative" (78): in the emergently creative way it is generated as a trust-effect of the economy's complex self-organizing. The self-organizing emergence of the trust-effect is retroactively validating. It is affectively validating in the currency of satisfactions gained. 

If enough trust-effects emerge at a sufficient rate of generation, then however unjustified they are, the system has a chance of continuing, in a positive orientation, trending up. Trust in the system has been restored. The affective conditions for continued surplus-value production are in force. Follow-on actions reinforce the trend. Positive feedback between the systemic and infra-individual levels locks in. Positive multiplier effects bubble through the economy. 

When the indicators come out, it is there to see, rationally summed up in a trend. The summing up can then be projected forward into future trends. Based on these statistical projections, a calculus of risks and probabilities can be made. The affective-effect is now as RATIONALIZED as it can get. The rationalizing indicators stoke economic activity, reinforcing the affective conditons for growth. They feed back to the regressive endpoints of the economy composing its plane of immanence, and turning around them, resonate transindividually across the economic field. Feedback loop. Economically, affectivity and rationality circle creatively through each other. The regress to the endpoint of the economic and the upward progress of the economic indicators are a single two-way movement of reciprocal feedback. They are systemically superposed pulses of the capitalist process, together ontopowerful.

Mirrroring the quantum vocabulary of the reduction of the wave packet, Luhmann refers to the production of a state of system trust as a "reduction of complexity." The economy cannot be micro-managed: do not laisser-faire the government. Although the economy cannot be micro-managed, through the feedback process it can be infra-stoked toward the emergence of trust-effects. The instability of the economy can, at least for certain hiatus periods, be affectively primed into metastability: a provisional stability snatched emergently from far-from-equilibrium conditions. Halcyon days. Vacation days from the full destablizing force of complexity. Provisional stability: no one really knows how long the trends will hold. System-trust is a fragile artifact hypersensitive to perturbation.

Luhmann drives the point home: "in the reduction of complexity," resolving into a metastable state, at the immanent limit, at the heart of the process, "there always lies an unstable, incalculable moment" (74). It is around this unstable, incalculable, hypersensitive moment that everything begins to revolve. THE PRINCIPLE OF DECISION AT WORK "CANNOT LIE IN COGNITIVE CAPACITY" actually involving a calculation that guides action before the fact (79). Ultimately, there is no prospectively knowing economic act. The whole process actually works best, Luhmann maintains, if the consciousness of trust and distrust are lost, so that the reduction of the readiness-potential wave-packet "BECOMES AUTONOMOUS" (71)—so that decision becomes autonomous. The affective churning of the system, through which the "rationality" of the system cycles, is best left unbeknownst even to itself.

Nonconsciousness becomes the key economic actor.


PART 2
A Doing Done Through Me
It appears evident that—the ultimate ends of human actions can never, in any case, be accounted for by reason, but recommend themselves entirely to the sentiments and affections of mankind. 
									—Hume

It appears evident that the individual subject of interest can no longer be considered an autonomous agent of calculated choice. IT IS THE ACT OF CHOICE THAT IS AUTONOMOUS, in the dissociative dimension of the dividual: that of the individual, absorbed in its relation to itself, plied by superpositions of contrasting states in a mutual immanence of functional indistinction. Choice spills from the readiness potential of the subject's affective blind spot, nonconsciously. This nonconscious level is NONPERSONAL. In the intensity of its immanence, the entire system at all its scales resonates in potential, carried to the absolute limit of its regressive endpoint. This infra-level holds all system states in itself, immanently, in potential. It only dissociates itself from other individuals and other levels the better to supercharge itself with what, elsewhere in the system, will play as separate states, following divergent tendencies: distributions of success and failure, trust and distrust, boom and bust, satisfaction and frustration, hope and fear. The nonconscious infra-individual level is, at the limit, the nonpersonal SUPERPOSITION of all levels, in the DISSOCIATIVE dimension of their DISTRIBUTIVE coming together. 

In the strange HYPERDIFFERENTIATED INFRA-ZONE OF INDISTINCTION BETWEEN CONTRASTING STATES, who or what decides? Dividually speaking, who or what chooses? Choice happens, there is no denying it. And as it happens, it is creative: an ontopowerful act. It is tantamount to an existential decision. But who or what decides? The answer is: no one. As in the French personne, which can mean both a someone and no one. Decision happens: affectively-systemically, in the nonconscious processual autonomous zone where mutually exclusive states come together. THE EVENT DECIDES, AS IT HAPPENS.

At the decisive moment, the self is no more in a state of determinate activity than it is in a cognitive state. It is ABSORBED IN A READINESS POTENTIAL that is intensely overdetermined, holding, Luhmann says, "a whole range of possible differences" in "sub-threshold latency" (Luhmann 1979, 73). The whole range of potentials are in it together, in their difference. They are in a state of MUTUAL INCLUSION, on the verge, poised toward the collapse destined to resolve the overdetermination of the and-both into this-not-that determinate effect, registrable in a calculus of risk and probability: from intensity to statistic. Such is the arc of neoliberal becoming.

The nonconscious "sub-threshold latency," churning with the intensity of a mutually inclusive range of potentials, in co-motional intensity, deserves a name of its own: BARE ACTIVITY. 

When we speak of the subject of interest's "self-relation" to bare activity, or the relation of the individual to its infra-individual dimension, "SELF-" has to be understood directionally. It is not a substantive. It connotes return. It is a movement. What moves to the limit of the economic field of life's regressive endpoint has nowhere to go but back out, into becoming. What comes in, becomes out. The plane of immanence of the infra-individual is, at the limit, all enveloping, and all emitting. It is the self-relation, in this double movement, of the field of life to itself. "Self-" is an adverb, not a noun. It qualifies the absorptive in-to-the-immanent-limit and ejective out-into-the-becoming movement of bare activity. It connotes a vector of life eventfully folding back into the autonomous zone of readiness potential out of which its next determinate step will decide to come. Self-relation in this adverbial sense is not reflexive, as in philosophical parlance, nor it is reflective in the psychological sense. Both of these notions recognitivize the event, implying conscious recognition or rational calculation—precisely what Luhmann entrusted not to be the case. 

All of this radically changes what is meant by choice. We do have a word for a choice that makes itself. There is name for a decision that wells up from a state of unknowing, yet still produces knowledge, in effect. For an act that has intense personal resonance, but of which it cannot be said that "I" felt it coming in full cognizance. A doing done more through me, self-relating, than by my I. That eventfully brings a creative moment to life in a way that registers as a change in me that is also world-changing. That word is INTUITION.

The basic paradox of the economic subject of interest is that the "calculus" of interest is unthinkable without reference to subthreshold activity more akin to a nonpersonal flash of intuition than step-by-step conscious deliberation. The "rationality" in the system is necessarily referred to an autonomy of decision bare-actively stirring at the affective heart of self-relation.

Deliberation Without Attention 

In the 1990s, the period in which neoliberal market deregulation and do-not-laisser-faire-the-government took on unstoppable momentum, management philosophy became obsessed with chaos theory. The order of the day was to learn how to surf complexity, extracting surplus-value on the fly, in the most fluid of conditions, in the absence of adequate knowledge for fully considered decision and the certainty it brings. This is the period in which capitalist enterprise became an "art" of decisionmaking. The management bookshelves where full of "creativity," "gut feeling," and "zen." The alchemists of old were fabled to transmute the most inconstant of materials into gold. Given the far-from-equilibrium complexity of the globalizing economy, a new capitalist alchemy was needed to transmute uncertainty into profit.

Consider this in light of the neoliberal economist's insistence, as analyzed by Foucault, that in the deregulated market the individual subject of interest is no longer defined by its social category or anchoring in a community so much as by its enterprise activity. The neoliberal individual is what Foucault calls the ENTERPRISE-SUBJECT. "If capital is defined as that which makes a future income possible, this income being a wage, then you can see that it is a capital which in practical terms is inseparable from the person" (Foucault 2008, 224). The "worker himself appears as a sort of enterprise": "entrepreneur of himself" (225, 226). The individual becomes an enterprise, as the enterprise at all scales becomes the fundamental unit of society (225). The enterprise-individual invests actively, affectively, in its own life, for the future satisfaction of a higher wage, a good return on monetary investment, and a happy retirement. The denizen of the neoliberal economy is no longer a citizen. It is HUMAN CAPITAL (224-265) or, with the gravitas of Latin, homo oeconomicus. Human capital navigates the same field of complexity and enterprise form of life as its fellow corporate persons. "Corporations are people too!" cried the presidential candidate (and the US Supreme Court agrees).12 As human capital, the individual's self-management—its attempts to manage its self-relation as an investment in its own future—must become a creative art of choice. Correlatively the personal art of choice must become corporate, in keeping with the entanglement between levels.

The management, self-improvement, and psychological literature of the 2000s overflows with theories of intuitive action and advice on how to mobilize or modulate the powers of nonconscious decision, now considered for all humanly capital intents and purposes to be more fundamental economically, if not better in all cases, than ratiocination. Much of the literature celebrates nonconscious decision, cheer-leading for gut feeling. These accounts are bolstered by studies showing, for example, that the more calculation and rational deliberation goes into making a consumer choice such as buying a new car, the less likely the choice will be to correspond to an expert cost-to-benefit analysis, and the less satisfying the experience will be perceived to have been "post-choice"—even independently of the issue of cost-effectiveness. Influential studies have found A NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN RATIONAL CALCULATION AND CONSUMER SATISFACTION. Nonconscious choice—intuitive "DELIBERATION-WITHOUT-ATTENTION"—produced "better" choices. This effect was slight for "simple" choices, and pronounced for "complex" ones, which in this context is the same as "costly" choices (Dijkserhuis et al. 2006). In other words, the more there is riding on a choice, the less rational calculation can be counted upon to lead to a satisfactory decision, both economically and affectively speaking. In the life of an individual, this might well lead to a viscerally felt disincentive to choose "wisely" by conventional rational standards. Somewhere along the road, it appears that the "good" consumer went out the car window with the "good" (pre-human capital, civil society) citizen.

Economic rationalism cannot be disentangled from self-deciding affective factors—all the less where it matters most. Issues of trust aside, the very question of what counts as a "success" or "failure" is subject to affective interference. It cannot be reduced to a purely economic cost-to-benefit analysis. When the affective interference doesn't come from uncertainty in the environment and the individual's relation to others, it still comes—from the individual's decisional relation to itself. The neoliberal wager of making self-interest the fundamental principle of the economy depends on maintaining a strict equation between life-satisfaction and rational calculus of choice. The denizen of the neoliberal world is called upon to equate the experiential value of its life—the SURPLUS-VALUE OF LIFE that makes each pulse of life feel that it was worth living for itself, above and beyond the increasingly impressive achievement of just getting by—with standard quantitative measures of economic success. It is precisely this equation that increasingly breaks down. It becomes clear that there is something in the very nature of decision that forbids it. The very definition of "success" oscillates between affective and economic determinants. This calls the integrity of human capital into question, and it is not just a circumstantial complication. More like a birth defect in its DNA.

It is often recognized in the literature that "gut feeling" tends to flounder when dealing with abstract statistics and probabilities. But we need to take this reservation about gut feeling itself with reservations. For nothing will change the fact that macro-economic indicators are statistical, meaning that they carry a margin of error that makes them inherently uncertain, dealing as statistics do with probabilities. Economic forecasting projects the probabilistic uncertainty forward. This means, once again, that results are undecidable with respect to any particular case. On the level of individual decisions, economic forecasting is little more than a mathematical framework for intuition to work within, garnished with a gloss of scientificity. The calculus of risk is not what it's cracked up to be, as is well attested by the regularity with which crises catch the experts by surprise, even though everyone knows that they periodically recur and are endemic to the capitalist process. The most learned economic number-crunching is affectively surrounded by a penumbra of inexpungeable uncertainty. Individual economic actors ultimately have nowhere else to go but back down the rabbit-hole. No amount of sophisticated modeling will expunge the hard economic fact that under complex conditions of uncertainty rational choice and affect-driven intuition enter a zone of indistinction. To put it another way, "rationality about the unknown requires emotions" (Pixley 2004, 30).

Jamming Rational Choice


Returning to the question of the individual actor's relation to itself, there has been a tectonic shift in experimental psychology as it has become increasingly preoccupied over the last ten to fifteen years with poking its empirical stick at the rabbit-hole of affect. Nonconsciousness studies has become a growth field in all areas, but most troubling for many in the key areas of decision and choice. Most recently, rational choice theory has had to contend with the emerging domain of "CHOICE BLINDNESS" theory, CB for short. In the science of choice, a ground-shaking acronymic shift is occurring from REM (rational economic man) to CB. The challenge is not only to the trustability of one's choices under conditions of extreme uncertainty. It reaches into the smallest recesses of the most everyday of situations—and ascends to the supposedly rock-solid heights of the individual's moral compass.

There are strange doings in the tea party of choice. Researchers in the psychology of consumer choice asked subjects to make a simple choice: between two varieties of tea and jam (Hall et al. 2010). The tastes of the proposed alternatives were as different as can be, for example between cinnamon-apple and bitter grapefruit. Participants were asked which variety they preferred. The researchers then switched the varieties unbeknownst to the tasters. Then they asked them to take what they thought was a second sample of their preferred flavor, and explain why they liked the flavor best. Two thirds of the time, the experimental subjects did not notice the switch. A cinnamon-apple aficionado would happily ingest bitter grapefruit—and convincingly explain their preference for it. Talk about rationalization of choice. 

On the one hand, this "choice blindness" demonstrates the power of perceptual PRIMING. A future sensation can be made to conform to a past sensation to which it is fundamentally different by force of expectation. "Expectation" may simply consist in a lack of cues that anything has changed, so that a new event is nonconsciously equated with the previous one by entropic momentum. This is what Whitehead calls the "conformation of feeling," whereby the present moment dawns as a continuation of the "subjective form" of the immediate past (1967, 183-184). The experimental subjects were poised for a taste, and tasted what they were poised for. The experience of the taste that isn't what it is, is a case of how the most basic SENSORY EXPERIENCE can be conditioned to yield not so much a sense-impression as a FABULATION.

This points to an experiential plasticity that belies any notion of an underlying principle of PERSONAL PREFERENCE as having the sovereign power to determine action. What are experienced as satisfying qualities of experience are suprisingly open to situational conditioning. How is a jam-eater to act according to their own self-interest, as signed and sealed by the satisfaction of a preference duly attained, if what constitutes satisfaction is fundamentally plastic? What is the difference between decision and non-decision if we can be as convincing, to ourselves as to others, about being satisfied with an outcome we did not choose? It is not only when the nature of the outcome is in suspense, held in readiness potential, that DECISION AND NONDECISION ARE IN A STATE OF SUPERPOSITION. A determinate decision, already verified once by an experienced satisfaction, can be made retroactively to enter into a state of superposition with non-decision by a later experience.

This is the recursive opposite of the collapse of the wave-packet by a future event. A sequence of action produces the wave-packet retroactively. Here, undecidability is not in the suspense of a readiness potential holding the futurity of the present. Rather, it is presently produced as a recursive AFFECTIVE FACT.17 Affectivity and rationality are entwined in a different way here. The affectability of the outcome as registered in qualitative experiential terms—the openness of an experience's satisfaction quotient to situational conditioning—is directly expressed in a RATIONALIZATION. This is another mode of the functional indistinction between affectivity and rationality. Were the individual really that—an individual rather than an in-the-dividual—this could not occur. But it does, and this gives the dividual itself two oscillating poles, corresponding to two modes of undecidability superposing affectivity and rationality. Both, paradoxically, can be understood as modes of overdetermination: on the one hand, an over-fullness with different states held intensely together in readiness potential; on the other, the altogether too-convincing matter-of-factness of the fabulatory fait accompli.

Even more troublesome for any notion of an underlying set of core preferences are studies demonstrating that under similar circumstances basic MORAL ATTITUDES have the consistency of jam. A similar experiment was performed in which participants were requested to fill out a questionnaire asking them to take a position on a statement of principle such as "to be moral is to follow the rules and regulations of society, rather than weighing the positive or negative consequences of one's actions" (Hall et al. 2012). They were also asked to rate the strength of their conviction on the issues. After filling out a questionnaire, they were asked to justify their position. Their answers had been surreptitiously reversed. A majority of the respondents did not notice the switch, and went on to produce a justification for the diametrically opposed moral principle to the one to which they had so recently adhered. Even those reporting the strongest of convictions on an issue were susceptible to the reversal.

The Primes of Life


How can people be so fickle? Have they no principles? How quickly they are duped! Think of the political implications! Isn't that how fascism succeeds, by exploiting just such phenomena? Yes, in part, it certainly is. But it is worth pausing a moment before getting too moralistic about the ease with which this choice-jamming occurs, lest we protest too much. Who among us can profess to be immune from such conditioning under all conditions?

Interpreted in light of the first experiment, the plasticity of moral conviction shown in the second experiment appears as a higher-order recapitulation of a PERCEPTUAL DYNAMIC. The phenomenon of choice-blindness points to a tendency toward fabulation built into in perceptual experience. Or more precisely: built into the the temporality of our perceptual experience. The self-evidence of our present perception does not stand the test of time. Our memory plays tricks on us. It is becoming increasingly accepted that a memory is not reproduced. Rather, it is regenerated. A memory is always an event, never a representation. The event of memory varies according to the conditions under which it is produced. Personal MEMORY is an evolving dynamic system that is predicated not on reproduction, but on recreation. In the vocabulary of cognitive science, memory is by nature "reconstructive." This means that the person we are as a function of our memories is self-recreating. If it weren't, personal growth and change would be impossible. 

The fabulatory element of perception as it varies over time is a creative factor in life. In its absence, the individual would be an ambulant repetition-compulsion, shackled to a bedrock of past preferences and principles. What would possess me to forego my tried and true satisfactions? The only way for change to occur would be through the imposition of modified behaviors from without, either in the form of brute conformal force, or through the disciplinary inculcation of norms meant to be interiorized in such as way as to foster conformal behavior even in the absence of force. Either way, individual choice is just as fundamentally called into question as it is by choice-jamming—and the conformal foundations are just as effectively laid for a potential authoritarianism or fascism to develop by a hardening of the boundary between the normal and the abnormal into a dividing wall of exclusion.

In the present context, it is capital to remember that the disciplinary inculcation of normed behavior invariably revolves around delayed gratification—the very notion of which is now struck by neoliberal paradox. This is why Foucault makes a point of saying that the rise of neoliberalism coincides with "A MASSIVE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE NORMATIVE-DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM" (Foucault 2008, 260). Under neoliberalism, the right to choose in accordance with one's self-interest becomes inalienable: "irreducible and nontransferable." Satisfaction is the sign of a self-interest well served, and so becomes the human-capital measure of the success of the economic entrepreneurship driving the economy. Its uncertain deferral has become under neoliberalism an irreducible and nontransferable problem. The neoliberal process assumes the problem. Neoliberalism finds it far more satisfying to live out the paradoxes of its own doctrine of choice—to surf the perturbational limit-zones of indistinction between affectivity and rationality that riddle its relational field—than to return to the normative containment of self-interest as a palliative or regulatory principle. Its passion is for deregulation. It happily chooses "creative destruction" over palliative care. It affirms the perturbations of far-from-equilibrium "oscillatory processes" over the normative stability of regulated change. Zones of indistinction between affectivity and rationality such as deliberation-without-attention and choice-blindness are something it can work with (a gold-mine for new marketing strategies!). Good citizenship is altogether too unenterprising.

It might still be objected that the experimental examples of fabulatory choice-blindness given above seem to have less to to do with self-creation, than with conditioning by others. But what is meant by CONDITIONING here needs to be examined. It is not assimilable to either of the two phenomena most aften associated with the term, classical Pavlovian conditioning and Skinnerian operant conditioning. The first creates reflex associations between stimuli, while the second uses a rigid system of punishment and reward to reinforce or deter target behaviors. Both function in a highly controlled, closed environment, and operate according to a stimulus-response model. The conditioning in the examples just presented, on the other hand were in uncontrolled, open environments. The tea-and-jam survey was conducted from a stall in a supermarket, and in the moral convictions survey passers-by were recruited in a city park. In neither case was a stimulus-response model employed. Rather, participants were brought into an interaction proposed to them in the open environment. The interaction constituted a subset of the activity occurring in the environment. In other words, a situation of encounter was produced within a larger context. The observed effects were the result of how the encounter was set up within these conditions. IT WAS THE SITUATION AND THE ENCOUNTER THAT WERE CONDITIONED, NOT DIRECTLY THE PARTICIPANTS. This qualifies the experimental intervention as ENVIRONMENTAL in the sense discussed earlier: as acting on the rules of the game, rather than directly on the players. The behavior of the participants was MODULATED through the way in which the parameters for the interaction were set, in the chosen contexts. The survey procedure and its structure of judgment are known genres of interaction, and as such can be expected to implant certain PRESUPPOSITIONS in the situation (such as that a survey-taker is unlikely to have studied sleight of hand magic tricks) and activate certain tendencies in the participants (such as a desire to cooperate with a seeker of knowledge and an eagerness to please someone in a relative position of authority). 

This form of conditioning, which modulates behavior by implanting presuppositions and activating tendencies in an open situation of encounter, is called PRIMING. Priming operates less through stimulus-response than through CUES whose force is situational. Priming addresses threshold postures (presuppositions) orienting a participant's entry into the situation, plus the associated tendencies that carry the orientation forward through the encounter. Accordingly, it does not exercise the same kind of power as normative-disciplinary mechanisms (of which both traditional forms of conditioning are highly distilled forms). Precisely because priming is orienting and activating, modulating rather than molding, it cannot guarantee the same level of uniformity of result. The results in the studies are impressive statistically speaking. It is stunning that the choice-blindness effect was observed in a majority to two-thirds of participants. But that still leaves a great deal of room for deviance and variation ("minority" tendencies), and nothing in the way the study was designed can indicate anything about what made the difference. In other words, unlike in normative-disciplinary modes of power, deviance is left to its own devices. The setup was AFFIRMATIVE in the sense that it implanted and activated in order to effect—rather than squelch and punish in order to negate. A significant minority of participants brought counter-tendencies to the encounter which self-affirmed, against the statistically prevailing conditioning. In other words, those who did not display choice-blindness were more SELF-PRIMING than effectively conditioned by the other's setting of the situational parameters. But then, were not the participants whose actions did display choice-blindness also self-affirming their tendencies, in the sense that they acquiesced to their own tendencies leading in that direction, and whatever countervailing tendencies they had were not allowed to determine the end result? And who would not have countervailing tendencies? Who does not harbor some degree of resistance to authority, or some mischievous inclination to throw a wrench into the machinery of knowledge associated with it?

What all of this means is that priming works with the dividual. Its mode of operation presupposes a tendential undertow in the life of the individual that is best approached affirmatively, and whose complexity is such that only a certain ratio of success can be guaranteed. The tendential undertow crests into determinate action, and this process can be modulated by the implantation of presuppositional postures and the activation of associated tendencies. The mechanisms for inflecting outcomes must be affirmative of the dividual, and operate in AN OPEN RELATIONAL FIELD. Relative consistency of results is attained by triggering a subset of activity in the environment. This SPECIAL ACTIVITY is set off against the surrounding activity in the open field, without being divided from it by a strict dividing line. It is focalized, without being segregated. The ongoing activity in the environment is less excluded than it is backgrounded. Priming is an art of situational emphasis. In keeping with its affirmative modus operandi, it functions by incitation or triggering, rather than punishment and reward. It induces PARTICIPATION, rather than imposing a form. It brings something to life in the situation, rather than carving away at life to make it conform to a mold. PRIMING IS AN INDUCTIVE MODE OF POWER. It induces. It allows things to come out, rather than battening them down. It brings to be, rather than making conform. It effects, rather than negate. In a word, priming is a mechanism of ONTOPOWER. 

It is of the utmost significance that priming depends, on the one hand on the individual's susceptibility to its own tendential infra-churnings, and on the other, on its OPENNESS TO THE SITUATION—the individual's bipolar affectability. Priming operationalizes the cross-sensitivity between the INFRA- AND MACRO- POLES of the field of neoliberal life. It attaches its procedures to the relational event-sensitivity of the denizen of the oscillatory neoliberal field of life activity. Priming is the power mechanism most closely allied to the workings of the neoliberal economy, as it lives out the paradoxes of its doctrine of self-interested choice. Its eshewal of hard-edged normative-disciplinary procedures makes it an exemplary mechanism of "soft power." The preemptive mode of power that characterizes the neoliberal field of life, in WAR and POLICING as much as in relation to the market, pivots on priming. Priming is the royal way to the modulation of events before they fully emerge.

In the case of specifically targeted, consciously applied practices of priming, like the experiment surveys just discussed, in order to guarantee statistically significant results, they must be capable of setting off an area of subactivity from the background activity of the constitutively open relational field of neoliberal life. However, there are also SCATTER-TECHNIQUES: techniques for sowing primings to the wind, in the much less guaranteed statistical hope that when they fall it will be upon a ground conducive to a special activity self-organizing itself around their impact crater. The internet and mobile communication devices are the most widely available tools for this. They lend themselves both to deliberation-without-attention and choice-blindness. For deliberation-without-attention can also be induced by priming. The way in which new communicational technologies prime for distributed attention, as users click their way through lengthy sequences of linked choices, sets the conditions for the intuitive decisionmaking that the experiment on consumer choice presented earlier confirmed. Who, while surfing, has not had the sensation of decisions making themselves through them? At the same time, the areas of focus that occasionally stand out in the sea of clicks are prime opportunities of choice-blindness to set in. 

None of this is in any way meant as a lament that the neoliberal environment in general, and the internet in particular, corrupts the sovereign power of individual choice, enslaves desires, and produces soft-powered citizens of regretful malleability. Netizens are not citizens in a degraded public sphere. They are denizens in a complex neoliberal field of life. The point is that mechanisms of priming are distributed everywhere throughout the field. They are networked into it, as well as being punctually set in place locally under certain circumstances by particular procedures of presupposition-planting and tendency-activation.18 Contemporary marketing strategies work at both ends, the distributed and the local. They exploit the ubiquity of communications technology to sow local seeds of priming that are encountered by the units of human capital that we are at every step in our wanderings: a free-range world of cues. 

The very ease with which the cue-sowing can spread and proliferate makes the habitat of homo oeconimicus a highly complex environment of primes. Under neoliberalism, priming goes feral. Priming in the wild saturates the field of life, forming a complex ecology with more institutional varieties involving particular encounters consciously foregrounding specialized activity (as was the case with the surveys). This makes it a necessity for individuals to learn to navigate their way through that environment, and cultivate tendencies for dealing with the churning of tendencies and the way it issues into actions that cumulatively determine the direction of their life. In other words, they are obliged, consciously or not (mostly not), to self-manage their prime encounters: to TEND THEIR TENDINGS. This is done through the patterns of navigation, access, and encounter they weave, and the cumulative effect can be significantly inflected by how their openness to chance encounter and sensitivity to relation is modulated by those patternings. This means that the neoliberal denizen is ultimately as self-priming as it is conditioned by the machinations of others. What direction their life takes is a complex collaboration playing out between their own dividual tendencies, conditionings of their behavior by other individuals and by situational setups, and accidents of chance encounter. CHOICE AND NON-CHOICE ENTER AN ACTIVE ZONE OF INDISTINCTION. 

Everything still turns around dividuating tendencies, because everything that happens recurs to bare activity. Everything feeds back into the mutually inclusive regressive end-point of the economy infra- to the individual, or resonates with it at an entangled distance. Neoliberal life oscillates around the zone of indistinction between affectivity (affectability) and rationality. In that zone, there is nothing so clear as the alternative between choice or non-choice, freedom or constraint. What there are instead are degrees of freedom: AUTONOMIES OF SELF-EFFECTING DECISION whose emergent movements of expression are liable to modulation by priming mechanisms; tendential playings-out that may be induced or inflected, but whose outcome is statistical; situational sensitivities and openness to relation that deliver the dividual to conditioning, but never divest it of the power to surprise. 

Towards a Politics of Dividualism

When the supposed sovereign power of choice is called into the question, the reaction is  often that an indignity has been done to PERSONAL FREEDOM—as if this notion could have survived unscathed the combined onslaughts of psychology, philosophy, and marketing, to name just a few of its historical nemeses. The indignation is based on the assumption that the opposite of rational choice is "IRRATIONALITY," the ultimate enemy of freedom. Irrationality is typically equated with "emotion," making affectivity enemy number two. But as we have seen, THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND IRRATIONAL IS NO LONGER SUSTAINABLE, if it ever was. Neoliberalism's pivoting around zones of indistinction between rationality and affectivity, its alloying of them as functional equivalents at critical points in its process, requires doing away with the duality. Instead, they must be seen as co-operating modes of activity that separate out under certain circumstances, no sooner to reconverge, feeding back and forward into each other with all the restlessness of bare activity. Only that bipolar oscillatory process as a whole can be seen as determining in the last instance. Except that it's not a last instance. It's a first and last and all-over instance: an irreducibly multiple and relational fielding, at the inmost endpoint of the economy as at its furthest reaches.

Fears of irrationalism construe the inability of an individual to choose wisely as the problem. But WHAT IF THE PROBLEM WERE INSTEAD THE RECEIVED IDEA THAT GROUNDING DECISION IN PERSONAL CHOICE IS FREEING? What if the problem is less the individual's affective inability to control its "impulses," or even the conditioning of its actions by others, than the fact that the freedom of choice is imposed. In both experiments, participants were called upon to judge. The imperative of rational choice calls upon the individual to act as if it were a rational animal all the way down. It attempts to lodge the individual's experience on the level of ratiocination, as if the spectrum of an experience could be reduced to the narrow bandwidth of conscious cognition, and perception were only a transparent window on a representation of the world from which the subject stands back in sovereign judgment. This amounts to an attempt to defuse the infra-individual level of bare-active tendency and any emergent autonomy of decision. It is a denial of nonconscious activity and of the dividuality for which it churns. The dividual infra-complexity of life can be backgrounded, but it cannot be entirely defused or denied. Its tendency is to reassert itself, across its silencing. The dividual rises, sometimes all the more insistently the more it is sidelined. All of this is neglected by the doctrine of rational choice and the simplistic opposition between rationality and affectivity on which it ostensibly relies. All of this is studiously neglected—and then the failure of someone to exercise their rational choice as wisely as a judge is greeted by ejaculations of scandalized surprise.

This is precisely what both experiments did. They generated their surprise results against the backdrop of the implicit assumption of rational choice. In both cases, the experimental subjects were required to justify their choices. What an odd request, to justify a taste. In everyday life, your response to the question "milk or sugar?" is rarely answered with "why?" The imperative to be rational about a matter of taste is likely to have distracted the subjects from their powers of deliberation-without-attention with which matters of taste are habitually approached. Interference was produced between the playing-out of the tendencies with which the most basic sensory experience is laden, and the duty to cogitate as if our perceptions were somehow fundamentally neutral and we stand back from our own tasting to hold it in judgment. As if the value of the tasting, its satisfactoriness, were separable from its occurrence, and the full-spectrum experiential IMMEDIACY OF THAT EVENT. In the consumer choice experiment, participants' powers of deliberation-without-attention were activated by complexity in the problem posed by the high-cost item of the car. The experimental setup invited, by admitting complexity into the situation as an active factor, tripping into action an autonomous decisionmaking power deciding through the experimental subjects. This "surprisingly" demonstrated the limits of consciously deliberative rational choice: it only works well under conditions of simplicity, in this case (as in most) coinciding with A LOWERING OF THE STAKES.

The fact that rational choice works best where it matters least indicates that rationality only effectively separates out under carefully controlled conditions where the ambit of life is reduced. It assumes, and demands, the reduction of vitality, a limiting of life's amplitude. Looked at this way, rationality is a limitative mode of power. REASON IS AN ANTI-ONTOPOWER. The question then arises: given this choice, why choose rational choice? What justifies that? Choosing anti-ontopower over ontopower is clearly not itself a rational choice. It is more a matter of inclination. But then, doesn't that make it a desire? Oops. Enter the zone of indistinction again: rationality is a desiring tendency; as a desiring tendency, it is as much a mode of affectivity as …. affectivity is rational given the intense situation that the life environment as a whole harbors uncertain conditions of complexity. If neoliberalism acted more on its doctrine of self-interested, rational choice than on the paradoxes it generates, it would miss its historic calling as an economic regime of ontopower.

Micro-economic considerations of the actual process of individual choice join macro-economics considerations of complexity and uncertainty, and together they lead to the inescapable conclusion: any politics of individualism unparadoxically predicated on an economy of self-interested personal choice, taking it for granted that units of human capital are rational animals, has missed the boat. That being the case, why not entertain the alternative of a politics of dividualism?

 A POLITICS OF DIVIDUALISM would affirm complexity, and the oscillatory autonomies of decision that come with it. It would find ways of tending tendencies, in order to navigate the zone of indistinction between choice and non-choice in such a way as to effect modulations of becoming that produce self-justifying surplus-values of life: pulses of life experienced as worth the living by virtue of the event they are, immanent to the event, as a function of its immediate experiential quality, without any tribunal of judgment hanging over them, sovereignly purporting to justify them extrinsically. These immanent event-values are not reducible to individual satisfactions, because they emerge from the oscillation between the dividual and the transindividual. Their emergence turns around the dividual, otherwise primed than by the doctrine of rational choice the paradoxes through which it neoliberally expresses itself. 

A politics of dividualism would operate in the unquantifiable currency of INTENSITY, as opposed to satisfaction. It would draw on the positive creative power of fabulation incumbent in perception, tending not only the tendencies dividually churning at the endpoint of the economy, but also to their situational openness and cross-scale sensitivities. This would be a directly qualitative, relational, and situational politics. It would see no contradiction between conditioning by others or by the collective texture of encounters, and the power of self-modulation each individual infra-carries in the playing-out of its dividual tendencies among themselves. It would define decisional autonomy as the co-operation of the orienting influence of situational conditioning and the spontaneity of tendential self-modulation, practicing at their dynamic intersection a POLITICAL ART OF DECISION. It would seriously experiment with the notion that FREEDOM IS IMPERSONAL: that it is at its highest power when decisions move through me, rather than being legislated by my all-too-cognitive, self-deceivingly "rational" I. It would involve care and sensitivity—care for the event of encounter, sensitivity to dividual-transindividual complexity. 

The role of the conscious, cogitating I would be to recognize the rationality of affectivity, and to contribute to its own modulation by forces moving through its micro-level from the infra- to the trans-. It would experience itself more as collaborator than the master of these forces. It would practice strategic self-surrender to them. (For more on this, see Supplement I.)

Double Involuntary / Autonomy of Decision

Before going further in the discussion of what a dividual politics might look like, it may help to summarize some of the implications of neoliberalism's unleashing of complexly self-organizing "oscillatory processes." 

Foucault highlights the key points. The subject of interest, he says, is "DOUBLY INVOLUNTARY" (Foucault 2008, 277). "The individual's enjoyment is linked to a course of the world that outstrips him and eludes him in every respect" (277). Each individual is "dependent on an uncontrollable, unspecified whole of the flow of things and the world" in which "the most distant event taking place on the other side of the world may affect my interest, and there is nothing I can do about it" (277; emphasis added). "Economic man," Foucault coninues, is situated in what we would call an indefinite field of immanence which links him, in the form of dependence, to a series of accidents [Involuntary No. 1: perturbations striking the dividual; emergent trust/distrust effects], and, on the other hand, links him, in the form of production, to the advantage of others [Involuntary No. 2: amplification; multiplier effects registering success/failure]  … The convergence of interest thus doubles and covers the indefinite diversity of accidents … so we have a system in which homo oeconomicus owes the positive nature of his calculation precisely to what eludes his calculation (277-78). 

Foucault makes it clear that for him the subject of interest, as human capital, cannot be understood in Marxist-humanist terms as "living labor" (Foucault 2008, 225). If the denizen of the market environment lives in a field of immanence that is constitutively open to "oscillatory processes" (259), then the individual is an immanent oscillatory point in "a MACHINE-FLOW COMPLEX" (225).19 The subject of interest is not humanistic but machinic. In order not to stream with the flow entirely at random, the decisions moving through have to machine cuts into the flow. Etymologically, that is what "decide" means: to cut (Whitehead 1978, 43). In Deleuze and Guattari's vocabulary, the very definition of "machine" is that which cuts a flow, and in doing so releases a quantum of subjective-systemic effect, as described in the above discussion of trust (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 1-8). The micro-economic level of the individual actor is thus sandwiched between Involuntaries No. 1 and  No. 2, or the infra- and the trans- levels respectively. The trans- level is the macro-systemic level, understood from the angle of its implication in a process that is more inclusive than the system itself, in that the process includes not only system-being but becoming. 

Under conditions of irreducible complexity where a range of potential differences are mutually included in each oscillatory point at every moment, it is precisely the autonomous cut of the EVENT of decision that makes something determinate come to pass, and come to be. The theorist who invented the concept of human capital, T. W. Schultz, proposed "an all-inclusive concept of technology" that would include "the innate abilities of man" (Schultz 1971, 10). Homo oeconomicus, Foucault agrees, is more appropriately classified as a live-wire technology than a biological species. Innately, it is an "ABSTRACT MACHINE" (Deleuze and Guattari 1987). Abstract, because the oscillatory point at which its abilities come through to decisive effect is a superposition of differences too overdetermined to be a specifically this or that as yet, in actually determined fact. The subject of choice is an abstract machine exactly at the point at which, and to the precise extent to which, it is a decider of complexity: it is an orderer out of quasi-chaotic intensity, in convergent co-operation with what eludes its calculations.

This line of thinking is much closer to Deleuze's later account of the mode of postindustrial capitalist power he named "CONTROL" than it is to Foucault's own concepts of BIOPOWER AND BIOPOLITICS of the late 1970s, elaborated in the period directly preceding The Birth of Biopolitics. Deleuze's short essay on "control" can be read as a capsule formulation of the "environmental" mode of power to which Foucault passingly alludes (Deleuze 1995; translation modified in all quotations from this essay).

Deleuze says that in control society, the individual is "undulatory, launched in orbit, on a continuous beam" (Deleuze 1995, 180). It "surfs" the flows, rides the waves. When surfing, your technology, the surfboard, has to slice the wave to ride it. It cuts in, to extract a quantum of forward momentum. The subject of interest as human capital does the same thing with economic flows. It cuts into the flow of labor to extract a quantum of forward life-momentum called a wage. It cuts again with its wage, this time into a flow of goods whose purchase extracts a quantum of life-satisfaction rewarding all the pain and sacrifice that has gone into energizing the forward momentum, encouraging one to stay on the wave. Behind closed doors, it may also, depending on how it invests its sensual desires, cut into the flow of sexed bodies in such a way as to extract a quantum of progeny: a reproductive human-capital investment for its own future well-being (intergenerational caregivers for when the old machine starts going to rust).21 The subject of interest as human capital surfs its future in range of ways, cutting into the flow of the days of its life to extract forward momentum from each of its investments in life-activity, endeavoring to sustain the momentum to the end as best it can. At every cut, it slices into its own nature—for it changes as it carries itself forward, becoming as it goes. It DOES NOT DIVIDE WITHOUT CHANGING IN NATURE (Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 33, 483). It does not cut without continuously becoming.

"In the society of control, the enterprise has replaced the factory" (Deleuze 1995, 179).  We are no longer in the disciplinary regime. The enclosed spaces producing and enforcing the norms of the well-disciplined life have developed cracks, and leak in all directions. For decades we have been experiencing a "generalized crisis of all of the sites of confinement, the prison, the hospital, the factory, the school, the family" (Deleuze 1995, 179). It is not at all that institutions of the disciplinary regime have disappeared. If anything, they have multiplied, and some, like the prison, have ballooned to unheard-of proportions in countries like the United States. It is less that they have disappeared than that the disciplinary regime they deploy within their enclosures no longer defines the overall field of power. The "massive withdrawal from the normative-disciplinary regime" that Foucault was sensing already in the late 1970s is best conceived as a resituating of disciplinary institutions within a larger ecology of regimes of power whose overall mode of power is of another cast (Massumi 2009). "New forces knocking at the doors" of disciplinary enclosures have integrated them into larger field. The passages through them and relays among them multiply and intensify. They are integrated as hard segments in the general conditions of flow, like boulders in a snow-melt flood. Swirling around them and in the cracks between them pass other movements, following other logics: "ultrarapid open-air forms of control" (Deleuze 1995, 179). It is these open-field effects that characterize the overall field of power. These are "environmental effects": emergent effects snatched on the fly from the complexifying flow. This capturing of effective energy from the flow occurs immanently to the field, in the "autonomy" of the open-air "environmental spaces" (Foucault 2008, 261). In the environment, many a disciplinary enclosure is set down, but none with the power to close itself to the field, so as not to keep on rolling over on itself.  

Deleuze gives another name to the regime of control: the "ENTERPRISE REGIME" OF POWER (Deleuze 1995, 182).22 An enterprise, he says, "is a soul, a gas," a lightness of being (179). A gas: the entreprise-subject's matter is dissipative, rather than frictional. Enterprise-being dissipates in the playing-out of its own gravity-defying lightness. It remains buoyant because rather than projecting an internal force outward, it borrows the energy of its outside and takes it into its own movement. It buoys itself on the quasi-chaotic air currents of the rapidly changing climate of life. Constantly banking, shifting, turning, churning with the flow, the life of the enterprise-subject continually assumes new shapes. It is dissipatively self-structuring, changing in nature as it goes. Its dynamics are nonclassical, far-from-equilibrium. They have no disciplinarily fixed form or "normal" structure. The enterprise-subject is a protean node of decisional autonomy, on the move in environmental spaces that are themselves moving, autonomous, and self-deciding, in the same way the weather is, and every bit as moody.

Disciplinary power molded the resistant body into normative shape. Control society does not mold, it modulates. A MODULATION is "like a self-deforming molding that is continually changing from one moment to the next, or like a seive whose mesh varies from point to point" (Deleuze 1995, 178). It is pulsing, liquid. It is waveform, in continuous transformation. Correlatively, the enterprise-suject is "undulatory" (180). The enterprise-regime's control society is populated at every scale by "the coexisting metastable states of a single modulation" process (179). Globally, it is "a universal deformer" (179), not unlike a synthesizer. The small-scale (in)dividuals populating the enterprise regime are  themselves populated by coexisting metastable states, wavily correlated to the larger modulations of the environment, to which, in their surf-a-thonic shape-shifting, they are moodily isomorphic. 

All of this marks "a technological evolution" accompanying the shift from second-generation to third-generation machines. But "more profoundly [it is] a mutation of capitalism" (180). The enterprise regime is capitalism become "essentially dispersive," waftingly dissociative in its self-relation, continually varying across the full range of its differentially correlated levels, integrating them wholesale into the same universal deformation. It is capitalism most becoming, given itself over gaseous matter and decisional soul, in dividuality and multiplier effect, to the deregulated market (181).

The discussion of decision-without-attention and choice-blindness added an essential dimension to this portrait of the neoliberal field of machinic life: the fact that punctual mechanisms of modulation can intervene at the nodal point where tendential infra-individual complexity of the dividual and the transindividual complexity intersect—where the subject of interest experiences its I, in a conscious registering of the force of the movements passing through it. At this intersection, decisional effect can be strategically leveraged. The cut can be modulated locally, as well as dispersively (as through the internet and mobile communications). 

Once again, the basic mechanism of this modulation is priming, of which there are many forms. All involve conditioning the situation, addressing the putative subject of interest from the angle of its constitutive openness to its own outside: from the angle of its relational sensitivities across scales, at the point where the feedback and feedforward between the dividual and the transindividual cross at what is experienced as the individual level. At that micro-level, priming works positively to induce emergent effects through cueing (or the lack thereof). Situational cues implant presuppositions and activate dividual tendencies. The presuppositional seeding of the field modifies the relative force of the multiple tendencies that are always churning on the infra-level, weighting the decision that is coming in certain directions, toward emergent determinations. The leveraging of effect by priming is inciting and orienting, rather than disciplining and punishing. It is inductive, a "POSITIVE" POWER in the sense in which Foucault uses the term. Conscious cogitation can always enter into the equation at this nodal point, but is never fully determining. It is the oscillatory process as a whole, as nodally modulated, that ultimately decides. All factors, including conscious cogitation, are CO-FACTORS in what always amounts to an exercise of processual autonomy producing complexly correlated subjective and systemic effects. 

In the experiments presented above, choice-blindness was the result of one form of priming. The priming consisted in withholding cues that would have signaled a change in the situation, while implanting presuppositions through the form of encounter of the exercise, which placed participants in a certain posture and activated tendencies favoring the "conformation of feeling" between the two tastings. In this experiment, as in the deliberation-without-attention experiment, participants were postured as subjects of interest called upon to exercise rational choice. The result varied, depending on the complexity of the consumer choice. The least complex choice was generally accomplished with nothing untoward happening to call the cogitational consumer prowess of the subjects into question. Deliberative rational choice, however, collapsed with the complex, higher-stakes choice. Participants who used their gut feelings to decide made better economic decisions by standard measures, and even aside from the question of cost effectiveness obtained greater satisfaction from the choice. These participants were obliged to make their choices while distracted (Dijksterhuis et al. 2006). With deliberative cogitation thus disenabled by the setup of the situation, the field was open for intuition to play a dominant role. Intuition took control of the situation.

 Intuition's taking-control was a coming pivotally into play of an autonomy of decision: a doing done through me. This is not so simple as a PASSIVITY on the part of the subject of interest. The subject's situatedness becomes one of the deciding factors of what transpires. The double involuntary of the feedback and feedforward between the dividual and the transindividual funnels through the situation, and is conditioned by the pressupositions and tendential orientations it highlights. Deleuze's theory of the control society construes the neoliberal field of life as A REGIME OF POWER IN ITS OWN ECONOMIC RIGHT, which operates through modulation. What the tripping into action of intuition demonstrates is THAT CONTROL'S MODULATION CAN ITSELF BE MODULATED. It would be nonsensical to say that control can be controlled. But it is eminently reasonable, intuitively speaking, to say that its movement of becoming can be inflected. The undulatory process of becoming oscillating the relational field can not only be surfed. The neoliberal denizen isn't limited to passively riding the waves, even if it cannot be the sole proprietor and master of its  action. It can make a splash, and experience the "gaseousness" of its "soul" as its own spray. A situational splash of activity can add to and alter the wave pattern: ripples on the surface of universal deformation. Under the far-from-equilibrium conditions of the field of relation, it is always possible that a small splash might amplify into a significant wave. If the neoliberal field of life is a regime of power, a situational splash deforming its surface in ways that goes against neoliberalism's dominant tendencies is a COUNTERPOWER. 

If there is counterpower, there can be a politics of neoliberalism's economization of life, in spite of its field-wide systemic reach and ontopowerful processual mutability. But counterpower cannot be found by returning to the subject of interest, for example in an attempt to rationally convince it to choose resistance in accordance with its "true" interests. Counterpower CANNOT RELY ON A PROGRAMMATIC POLITICS OF COGNITIVE PERSUASION. That strategy actually takes neoliberalism's key doctrine of the subject of interest as rational chooser at its cynical word—ignoring the accompanying paradoxes that make neoliberalism the formidable, undulatory regime of power it is. An effective counterpower politics must engage neoliberalism where it draws its power: in its paradoxes, infra- to its undulations. Counterpower must operate immanent to contemporary capitalism's paradoxical field, in resonance with the economy's inmost end. This means operating, like neoliberalism, as an ontopower. An IMMANENT COUNTER-ONTOPOWER: what other alternative is there, given the globalization of capitalism's neoliberal regime of power? There is no getting outside it. Immanence is not an option: it is a condition of life, and the seat of becoming. The biggest paradox of all is that countering ontopower with ontopower, immanent to its field of relation, requires practicing INTUITION AS A POLITICAL ART.

Fielding the Event

Intuition is not some mystical inner sense. It does not connote a deeper or more authentic relation to self. And it is not the opposite of rationality. There is a large body of studies on priming in which an image or word flashes by too quickly to be consciously registered, in the half-second or so when a perception is in readiness potential, just stirring in emergence, not yet having taken definitive form. This is the infamous Libet lag, in which experience is absorbed in its own formation, immanent to its own arising, at its inmost end, about to spill forth in a formed perception and a corresponding action: experience at the level of bare activity. It has been shown that at this level the meaning of unregistered words inflect the interpretation of following words that are perceived consciously, demonstrating that highly elaborated cognitive functions like reading can be performed nonconsciously (Massumi 2002, 29-31, 195-197; Sklar et al. 2012). It has also been shown that multi-step mathematical operations can even occur in this way (Sklar et al. 2012). It is not that rational operations are absent from this level. It is that they ARE PERFORMED IN THE FORMING OF PERCEPTION. They are not performed secondary to perception, in a manner reflective upon it. They are performed nonreflectively, absorbed in the immediacy of perception's emergence, in too short a lapse for them to be separate operations. Their operativity, their mode of activity, is enveloped in the movement of perception's arising. They figure in perception's genesis, in-mixed among its formative factors. Coming flush with perception's coming to be, they figure as ontogenetic factors of immediate experience. C.S. Peirce speaks of this in terms of "PERCEPTUAL JUDGMENT" (Peirce 1997, 199-201; Peirce 1998, 155, 191-195, 204-211, 226-242). A perceptual judgment expresses itself in an action that is inflected in such a way that would seem to indicate that a separate act of judgment had preceded and deliberately oriented it, when it has actually occurred in conditions under which NO SEPARATE ACT OF CALCULATION COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN PERFORMED. 

Intuition involves perceptual judgments. It is not, however, reducible to them. It is not just a faster ratiocination. For there are other modes of activity co-enveloped with perceptual judgments at the ontogenetic level of bare activity. Multiple tendencies are activated at the same time, and these cannot be separated from the "calculations" of perceptual judgment. 

Take this example of how a presuppositional field works, loosely based on the work of linguist Oswald Ducrot (Ducrot 1980, 69-101). You enter a field without noticing a rather crucial detail in the situational conditions: there's a bull at the other end. The moment the bull makes it presence felt, before you have had time to think consciously, even to the extent of registering the bull in a fully formed act of recognition, you are BRACED. You are braced into the necessity of living out the situation, for better or for worse. You have no choice about that. You're in it. Your life is entirely absorbed in the immediacy of the brewing event. You're taken into the incipience of an event you have no power to decide not to participate in. But the event has not yet played out, so there may be ways it might be inflected that will make a difference—one as fundamental as the difference between health and injury or even life and death. As you are braced into the event, the field changes. It becomes a FIELD OF POTENTIAL. 

Without having had the time to consciously think it through, potential lines of escape appear to you. You prefiguratively feel yourself avail yourself of them, in BUDS OF ACTIONS poised to play out. Incipient actions come together, in an immediate feeling of the alternatives they offer. You have been braced into the a field of potential composed of a multiplicity of paths of action. Your life is in that multiplicity, splayed between alternatives. Which to choose? No time to ponder. There is only time to act, and perhaps not even that, successfully. No sooner has the field of potential proposed itself than you have already assessed the alternatives. You have registered the distance between you and the bull, between you and the fence following different paths, without consciously puzzling it through. You have comparatively registered the time necessary for each potential escape, without actually having had any time to calculate the comparisons. You have considered which gestures will incite the bull and which will cause it to pause, without actually deliberating on bull behavior. Your body launches into movement, following what you viscerally feel to be the best course, with a rush of feeling you could never separate out from the situational assessments and the calculations that you didn't actually have the time to make—or from the experience of the movement itself. You have performed an EMBODIED THINKING-FEELING IN MOVEMENT, all it one splash. Your dawning realization of the presence of the bull included all of this. You escape. In effect, you have made a life-saving choice—without having performing anything like a separate act of choice. You have acted "rationally," without the ratiocination. You have gained your freedom from the bull, without exercising freedom of choice per se.

This embodied thinking-feeling in movement is intuition. Far from a mystical state one enters at a whim, it is AN INTENSE INVOLVEMENT IN A HIGHLY CONDITIONED, NON-OPTIONAL EVENT. Intuition does not have an object. It has a fielding. It comes with a field potential that is movingly thought-felt before its elements are consciously registered as the objects of a fully formed perception, and is immanent to what occurs as a function of that field. The immanence of this thinking-feeling can be parsed out, retrospectively, into a different aspects or elements. But each of them can only figure because the others are there for it to figure with. They are MUTUALLY INCLUDED in the energizing of the event, as co-operating factors in its playing-out. 

One aspect is the immediate registering of the IMPERATIVES of the situation. These are the nonconscious presuppositions implanted in the field as you brace into it, making the coming event non-optional. This is the aspect of perceptual judgment: CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE SITUATION THAT PRE-MAKE THEMSELVES AS THE PREMISES OF AN EVENT and as the energizer of the movements composing it. A second aspect is the taking form of a field of potential holding within itself a MULTICIPLICITY OF PATHS OF ACTION, corresponding to different outcomes. These potential alternatives come together in the immediacy of the situation, as a single complex. Their coming-together in all immediacy in-forms the perceptual judgment with an array of hypothetical unfoldings. This aspect of IMMEDIATELY LIVED HYPOTHESIS is what Peirce calls ABDUCTION. Both of these aspects, perceptual judgment and abduction, come with yet another aspect: tendency. The imperatives of the situation registering in perceptual judgment actuate a tendency—to stay alive. The abductive registering of hypothetical unfodings inhabiting the perceptual judgment bifurcate that dominant tendency into an array of subtendencies. These fight it out among themselves, in a time too short for them to actually interact with each other as separable actions/reactions. Rather, they come together in commotion: in immanent co-motion. For each is an incipient action path: a poising for movement; an orientation toward a terminus. That's a fourth aspect: BARE ACTIVITY, as a coming-together in readiness potential of what can actually only terminally unfold as a parting of the ways. Only one path with come about. The co-motion of tendencies works itself out, and one issues forth into action, as of its own accord. This is a fifth aspect: cut. A decision has been moved to make itself; you are moved to embody it. The decision comes through you. Which leads to another, utterly crucial, aspect: all of this is felt to matter. The tendential commotion only works itself out due to the forward pressure exerted by the fact that the coming event is intensely felt to matter. It is the affective intensity of the situation that powers its playing out. In the end, it will have all been about desire, from the beginning. You effectively desired to survive. You wanted it. Or rather: the eventful decision that moved you by moving through you affirmed that tendency in you. "In you": in the dividual sense. 

All of this has occurred not on the individual level, but in-the-dividual. The autonomy of decision that expressed itself in your action-path effectively has a WILL. More precisely, it IS a will: its autonomy is a willing willing itself to occur in the local arena of a situated subfield of the overall field of life, uncertainly oscillating between the poles of the dividual and the transindividual. HERE, AFFECTIVE INVOLVEMENT IS THE FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT OF WILL. Affectivity and will are in a zone of indistinction—which includes aspects which would be considered eminently rational were they separable from the zone of indistinction with affectivity, in its functional equivalence with will. But they did not occur separately. The "RATIONAL" ASPECTS of the event – judgment,  hypothesis, comparative evaluation of alternatives, decision—were mutually included in the event along with all they other co-operating factors. In the event, they came as perceptual judgment, abductively thought-felt hypothesis: tendential auto-evaluation. Decision inseparable from the embodied fact of movement. The rational aspects came FUSED INTO the singular complex that was the playing-out of this event. Because of the effective dominance of the aspect of affective involvement, the fusional complex can be qualified overall as affective. But it is in fact more an EVENT COMPLEXION: a complex of co-composing factors, including ones we may categorize as rational.23 You can think of the event's complexion as its unfolding's immanent oscillation between all of its contributory factors, already resolving into an action path in a interval smaller than the smallest perceivable: in the infra-instant of bare activity, turning out; in a regression to the inmost end, turning instantly about.

Every event is complexioned, exhibiting its own signature fusion of affectivity and rationality. Events of decision that we experience as rational choices, seemingly without the motive force of affect to move them, envelop in their complexion all the infra-aspects just described, including the functional equivalence of affective involvement and will. They just ignore or deny them. For as we will see with Hume, there is no purely rational reason to make any particular choice, or even to make a choice at all. REASON HAS NO MOTIVATING FORCE. For one thing, its rational calculations could go on forever. Reason ruminates, in a way that can never fully digest itself. The rumination may came closer and closer to a rationally justifiable conclusion, but left to its own devices it would never actually reach one because there will always remain a logical possibility that some crucial factor had been overlooked or miscalculated. Rationality, practiced as if it effectively had decisional autonomy, is THE FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT OF DOUBT. It is haunted by its own version of the "stopping problem" in computer programming. Ultimately, the cut has to happen. And it can only happen if something cuts into the rumination, to cut it off. Calculatio interruptus. This is the feat of affect. It will always occur at a point which, from the point of view of rationality's constitutive indigestion, can only be arbitrary.

Rationality is in no way the opposite of affect or emotion. As Pixley remarked, rationality positively requires emotion. Rational choice only works if it arbitrarily surrenders itself to an autonomy of decision that is one with an affective willing. Ratiocination chews its cud. Affect cuts to the quick. In the final analysis, this makes the outcome of every event an affective fact.

Tribunals of Reason ((SKIP TO PHYSICAL INTUITION))

None of this prevents structures of rationality from building, and settling into the world, evolving what become critical functions, as the field of relation wraps itself around them. Structures of rationality make them indispensable, including, of course, for the economy. This process requires the creation of relatively closed milieus capable of filtering the noise of the overall field of relation. Setting up boundary conditions pre-reduces incoming complexity, controlling the destabilizing power of field-perturbations. The result is an eddy of relative stability (a less provisional metastability) in which rational procedures can institutionalize themselves in way that guarantees a regularity of result. Technoscience, of course, is the most outstanding example (and bureaucracy the basest). 

Technoscience's boundary conditions are patrolled by what Bruno Latour "tribunals of reason"—mechanisms of judgment pronouncing certain phenomena and modes of activity as admissible for rational proceduralization and rejecting others as irremediably "irrational" (Latour 1987, 183-184). The result is less an enclosure than a set of transactional parameters regulating both the interactions occurring internal to milieu, and the coupling of the work of the internal milieu to the forces of the outside: a differential network. The control of field perturbations is not only exerted at the boundary. It is repeated inside the network, in the proceduralization of its signature activities.24 Activity is painstakingly formatted for the production of the promised regularity of result. The scientific method's procedures for ensuring "controlled experiments" fulfill this role for technoscience. They amount to disallowing field-interferences by isolating which contributory factors will be allowed to express themselves, so that they can be effectively treated as independent variables, making them more manipulable. Complexity is then built back up toward, from these basic building blocks—as if the world were an edifice rather than an "unspecified whole of flow," and as if the ordering of the world rode a one-way elevator to the upper stories (at the very top of which is perched the penthouse of analytic reason). In a word, a highly strategized, and standardized, practice of event-conditioning is set in place. 

Reason's stopping problem is pragmatically solved on the elevator ride up. Criteria for what constitutes acceptable results draw the procedural finish line, imposing the paradoxical but eminently practical mechanism of a regularized arbitrary cut-off point. In science, the main criterion of acceptability is reproducibility. The reproducibility of results caps the filtering-out of the singularity of unbidden field-effects, making them, against all odds, predictable (more or less, and under certain, relatively-closed field conditions). A second criterion is falsifiability (the bureaucratic counterpart of which is the right to appeal). The scientific method's principle of falsifiability is of particular significance here. It expresses the fact that the entire rational structure is built not on overcoming reason's riddling with doubt, but quite the opposite on its institutionalization. Given reason's constitutional inability to expunge doubt, any structure of rationality that does not build doubt into its edifice will end up crumbling. Doubt will return, in form of cracks fatally undermining the edifice (such is the fate of the totalitarian bureaucratic State). Better to build it in constructively than attempt to disavow it. This strategic openness to doubt constitutes the liberalism of structures of rationality, and is the vector by which they are able to settle into the great open neoliberal world, negotiating a self-protective settlement with its far-from-equilibrium fickleness. That, and the fact, in the case of technoscience, that its regularity of results feeds the capitalist process's voracious appetite for product development and constant turnover. 

For any structure of rationality to produce a regularity of results, and on that basis to settle in and make itself indispensable, it cannot in point of fact completely filter out what it brands as "irrational." For technoscience, the "irrational" boils down to uncontrolled complexity-effects, and the intuitions of perceptual judgment and abduction which alone are capable of fielding them. As science studies has amply shown, the everyday practice of science does not in fact suppress the superposition of modes of activity found at the germinal level of any and all action-perception. Laboratory life is a "mangle of practice"—a site of complex "intertwinements" among a plurality of active factors (Pickering 1995, 23). The "mangle" is irreducibly relational. Active factors mutually "capture" each other, in an emergent "reciprocal tuning" (20). This differential attunement gives the lie to any simple notion of intentionality, understood as a calculated rational choice exercised by an individual decider (17-20). Every rational structure is rationalizing. It is rationalizing in both senses of the word. First, in the sense that the construction of its edifice resides on the shifting ground of the mutual inclusion of modes of activity whose "reciprocal tuning" cannot be considered rational as a whole—but from whose unspecified whole rational results are procedurally extracted. Second, in the sense that it must excuse itself of this germinal sin of relational openness by explaining the mangle away (think of the scandalized reaction on the part of many scientists to science studies's poking its nose into the relational complexity of the everyday workings of the laboratory). Rationalizations aside, the mangle cannot not be negotiated, in order for any enduring settlement to be arrived at. Yet for reasons of institutional pride of place (i.e., for purposes of power-positioning in the larger relational field), the guards of the tribunal of reason are duty-bound to occult it, or at least background it.

The filtering-out of complex relational effects can actually hinder the course of science. Evolutionary biologist Lynn Margulis revolutionized the scientific understanding of the origin of multicellular life by reintegrating relational complexity-effects, and then accomplishing the feat of extracting from them a scientifically admissable notion—that of endosymbiosis (or immanent intertwinement; see Margulis 1999). "She simply refused not to believe her own intuition" (Archibald 2012, R6). The most far-reaching advancements in scientific understanding invariably involve dipping back into the superpositive "chaos" of the affective wave-packet, in order to extract a rationalizable complexity-effect, and to formulate it in such a way that it can gain admission to controlled experimentation as an independent variable lending itself to reproducible results (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, 130-131, 202). This construction of independent variables as building blocks for a larger structure makes science's achievements as much inventions as discoveries. These are not mutually exclusive terms. (Stengers 1997, 146; Stengers 2000, 80-81; Stengers 2011, 306). The creativity proper to science as a structure of rationality is a function of its typically disavowed fishing in the pond of singularity. Nobel-prize winning microbiologist Barbara McClintock was unabashed about this. She described her scientific process, which led to crucial advances in the understanding of genetics, as revolving around her ability to use "empathy" to intuitively "descend" into the complexity of the internal milieu of the cell (Stengers 1997, 115). It is a rarely spoken secret of science that perceptual judgment and abduction are prime factors entering into the mangle of its everyday practice.

One of the most important implications of this for the present essay is that it requires the statement made earlier that "gut feeling" fails when it comes to probabilities to be amended. Philosopher Michael Strevens has written on the central role of "PHYSICAL INTUITIONS" in scientific discovery (Strevens 2013). Probabilities are difficult to handle intuitively in general—which is to say in the abstract. However, in the singularity of embodied situations, as in the bull example, our understanding of the regularities of causal relationships, as ingrained in our body's sensorimotor habits, kicks in. This is accomplished not, as Strevens understands it, by the automatic application of "rules of inference." It is not a separable, cognitive operation, as Strevens himself admits, although without drawing the necessary implications of that insight for his cognitivist vocabulary: you just "see what will happen next," directly, without actually performing calculations (Strevens 2013, 1; emphasis added). This perceptual ability, by the account developed here, arises from the complex relation between the modes of activity constitutive of the life of the body, co-contributing to an outcome through their mutual inclusion in the unfolding event, on the germinal level of bare activity, in the production of an emergent perceptual judgment. It results from the co-operation of the sense modes, at the core of which in many situations is an effective fusion of vision and proprioception, with sound a close second in terms of its superpositional trigger-happiness (Massumi 2002, 58-61, 179-184; Massumi 2011, 95-97, 112, 124-125, 137, 143-144). 

The irreducibility of "physical intuition" to the cognitive category of inference or the application of rules is well understood by anyone (or even anyone's dog) who has played frisbee. The flight of the frisbee is oriented, but subject to modulation on the fly by irreducibly complex playing-out of atmospheric conditions: in a word, the wind. The complexity of the dynamics of frisbee flight are already so complex that a rule-based calculation of the curve of the frisbee's path, even without unexpected affections of the wind, can only be accomplished by calculus (Lynn 1999, 23-25). And yet I, and your average dog, neither of whom has studied calculus, can catch it more often than not. We catch as if we had carried out a complex operation of calculus. And not only that, we instantaneously correct for perturbations occurring en route. This requires an amendment to the earlier statement that "multi-step" arithmetic operations can be performed nonconsciously. The multistep operations are not performed in multiple steps. They are performed in one go, as if they had come consecutively—but, as it happens, fused into a perceptual  judgment. Perceptual judgement is capable of packing the multiple into the dynamic unity of an occurrence. 

We catch the frisbee because of this capacity of perceptual judgment. But not only perceptual judgment. We also rely on perceptual judgment's capacity to extrapolate itself into a perception not just of what is presently occurring, but of what is coming next. We abductively live out the intuitive hypothesis of where the frisbee is wafting, shifting our posture and position on the fly in attunements with the disc's modulations, all as smoothly as the wind. When we catch the frisbee, in spite of the incalculable complexity of its chance-inflected flight path, what we have done is to effectively perceive chance (Massumi 2014). Strevens calls this "tychomancy" (the divining of chance). 

What humans can do that dogs cannot is to extrapolate further, into theoretical constructs capturing the perception of chance for science, and its signature activity of regularizing results. Strevens studies in depth the central role of "physical intuition" in such scientific advances as Maxwell's discovery of the probability distribution of the molecular movement of gases. This discovery laid the foundation for "statistical mechanics, this theoretical scaffold that now supports a great part of all physical inquiry" (Strevens 2013, 7). In other words, the capacity of science to operationalize probabilities is actually an outgrowth of intution's abductive prowess. Can not the same be said of statistics as a whole? However, the more general and abstract the realm of probability, the more extenuated becomes the role of perceptual judgment, to the point that it is all but lost in domains of such large-scale, open-system complexity as the economy.  

This prepares the way for the next section's discussion of Hume's theory of the limits of reason, as well as on the roles it can play in its relation to affectivity. The crucial point here is that STRUCTURES OF RATIONALITY LIVE BY WHAT ESCAPES THEM. They feed on affective-relational intuition. What positive power they possess is extracted from perceptual judgment and abduction. RATIONALITIES ARE APPARATUSES OF CAPTURE OF AFFECTIVITY. As we will see, so are emotions. A rationality is not unlike a collective structure of emotion (just vastly more proceduralized). That is why we become so easily invested in them.

It must be said that little of this applies to economics. The status of economic's rationality as a "science" is widely, and rightly, contested. The true status of the "dismal science" is more a fusion of wishful thinking and market boosterism, than of perceptual judgment and abduction. The tribunal of reason has not been kind to it. The denizen of the neoliberal field is largely left to its own abductive devices.

Finessing the Event

Now, back to the paddock. Add a frisbee to the bull. We can be the wind. We can throw the bull a curve. I mean, we can throw it a gesture that inflects its course, just as a gust inflects the path of the frisbee. Make the bull gaseous. Wind it onto another path.
When the field of potential arose with the dawning of the event, it did not just include paths of escape. It also included potential gestures that might immediatly modulate the relation between you, the intruding field perturber, and the territorial bull. If performed with just the right accent, a RELATIONAL GESTURE of that kind can alter the complex of action-paths coming into force. A potential line of escape might appear that wouldn't otherwise have been activated. Thus in the heat of the event, a potential is coined. It is INVENTED, not as an independent variable extracted from the event: as an immanent point-modulation of the integral field. A differential path deviation appears out of nowhere. Or rather, it punctually emerges out of the full-spectrum complexity of the event. The change in the field of potential takes effect as a function of how all the elements have happened to come together toward the coming event, but it was triggered by one factor among them. A punctual gesture CATALYZES a modulation of the whole of the field of action-potential. The gesture would come to nothing if it did not factor into its own performance the potential of the event in all of its contributing factors. It works by finessing the way they come together. Even an almost imperceptible tweak, a slight turning of the eyes or subtle change in posture, can pivot the bullish relational field around itself, catalyzing it into a change of state. 

The modulatory gesture is a CATALYTIC EVENT CONVERTER. In its inventiveness, it is a punctual whole-field resynthesizer. This is the positively creative kind of fabulation referred to earlier: the invention of potential flush with the event's dynamic form of expression, movingly one with its unfolding. Finessing the relation: the fabulatory art of the event. 

Now take all of these considerations, subtract the bull, move into a different kind of situation implanted with presuppositions we would tend to call political. What would POLITICAL FABULATION Think-feel like? What gestures might catalyze a whole-field change of state? Answer that question, and you have intuition as a political art of the event. 
One thing is clear: such an art of politics would not be grouded in the personal freedom of choice of the individual subject of interest. Rather, it would pivot around the relational fabulation of affective facts. It would register that FREEDOM IS NOT CHOSEN: IT IS INVENTED. It is invented—in a way that is not easily distinguishable from a discovery.

This political-intuitive invention is a necessity of life. There is a need to escape the presuppositions of the field of relation into which we are collectively braced. Not by opposing them with an alternate utopian universe where individual choice is finally enabled and allowed free reign (as if such a thing were conceivable, given the web of interdependencies and cross-sensitivities that are part of the warp and woof of life). Not by rationalizing the entire field of life through the good graces of a tribunal of judgment acting from on high (were such a thing possible, even if it were desirable). Rather, by immanently event-converting this rabbit-holed neoliberal world in which we churn. By inventively gesturing neoliberal life toward a whole-field change of state.


PART 3
Beyond Self-Interest


It is not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger. It is not contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an Indian or person wholly unknown to me. It is as little contrary to reason to prefer even my own acknowledged lesser good to my greater good …
		—Hume (1984, 2.3.3, 463)

Politically, things are never as simple as a bull in a ring. Capitalism's fences don't keep its bullishness in, or the movements it's most afraid of out: unofficial or unregistered flows of goods and people, unregistrable financial flows, and systemically imperceptible forms of capital. Unofficial and unregistered flows include the smuggling of legal and illegal commodities such as drugs, and the press of refugees and undocumented workers. Unregisterable flows include highly abstract forms of financial capital such as derivatives and credit default swaps whose complexity defies calculation,25 and at times even makes tracing ownership impossible (this has been a problem in the wake of the US subprime mortgage crisis). Systemically imperceptible forms of capital include neo-currencies like Bitcoin. Capitalism is afraid of these movements to the extent that it tends to its own metastability, counter to its dominant tendency of irrationally exuberant passion for reckless liquidity. But at the same time, these movements are its indispensable crutches, and its cutting-edge (its profit hedges, and its probe-heads of futurity). Hence: porosity is the order of the day. Through the pores, distant events resonate, and correlate. To paraphrase Foucault, the neoliberal denizen is complexly dependent on an uncontrollable, unspecified whole of the flow of things and the world in which "the most distant event taking place on the other side of the world may affect my interest, and there is nothing I can do about it" (Foucault 2008, 277). 

Given the cross-scale sensitivity of the dividual to the transindividual, and considering the troubled equation between choice and satisfaction, a question arises that is as challenging to neoliberalism's founding figure of the subject of interest as the question as to whether rational choice actually works. What if by events that "affect my interest" we don't just understand events that can go against my interests? WHAT IF EVENTS OCCUR THAT AFFECT MY COMMITMENT TO MY OWN INTEREST? After all, for what good reason should a nonpersonal autonomy of decision that does itself through me do what it does for me? Given the resonant sensitivity of infraindividual oscillatory processing, is there any a  priori reason why decisions pivoting on the individual should cut the flows of the unspecified whole of relational activity for my benefit? Given the transindividual attunement of my dividual dimension to that of others elsewhere in the economic-relational field of life, why should the decisions moving through me not benefit a distant me, even to my me's disadvantage? On the other hand, what prevents decisions that I do manage to make, against the odds, according my own best rational interest, from harming others? In the long run, the theory goes, everybody benefits. But who can deny the collateral damage that occurs along the way, as inequalities grow and whole swathes of the earth's population are consigned to misery? What if the long run gets lost along the route, and dead-ends in yet another crisis? What if the neoliberal promise of prosperity and satisfaction for all runs permanently off-course? From our present perspective, with no end in sight of the last crisis years later, and the threat of irreversible climate change and the attendant global upheavals hanging over our heads, and international efforts to reverse it foundering for fear that it will harm the neoliberal economy (never mind the people it theoretically benefits), the question is more: what are the odds that it won't run permanently off-course? 

Your Life for My Little Finger?

The two-pronged question of what ensures that choices are made in accordance with the decider's self-interest and, when that is the case, what prevents the choices made here from doing immediate harm elsewhere before multiplier effects have had a chance to bubble through the relational field, in theory to everyone's satisfaction, were of central concern to the early theorists whose thought informed the doctrine of the subject of interest. They sought to respond to them by turning to moral philosophy. Turning instead to politics—as will be suggested here—was excluded on the one hand by their mistrust of the State, and on the other by the fact that non-State-based collectivist politics are pointedly incompatible with the economic individualism they advanced. Foucault cites Adam Smith's elder, David Hume, on these points, rather than Smith's own The Theory of Moral Sentiments. This is presumably because the radicality of Hume's position on the relation between rationality and affectivity is more resonant with the unspecified whole of the flow of things and the world of today's neoliberalism, and involves a significantly different view of how self-interest plays out. Foucault cites a famous passage from Hume's Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals on the decisional impotence of reason: It appears evident that—the ultimate ends of human actions can never, in any case, be accounted for by reason, but recommend themselves entirely to the sentiments and affections of mankind, without any dependance on the intellectual faculties. Ask a man WHY HE USES EXERCISE; he will answer, BECAUSE HE DESIRES TO KEEP HIS HEALTH. If you then enquire, WHY HE DESIRES HEALTH, he will readily reply, BECAUSE SICKNESS IS PAINFUL. If you push your enquiries farther, and desire a reason WHY HE HATES PAIN, it is impossible he can ever give any. This is an ultimate end, and is never referred to any other object. Perhaps to your second question, WHY HE DESIRES HEALTH, he may also reply, that IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE EXERCISE OF HIS CALLING. If you ask, WHY HE IS ANXIOUS ON THAT HEAD, he will answer, BECAUSE HE DESIRES TO GET MONEY. If you demand WHY? IT IS THE INSTRUMENT OF PLEASURE, says he. And beyond this it is an absurdity to ask for a reason. It is impossible there can be a progress IN INFINITUM; and that one thing can always be a reason why another is desired. Something must be desirable on its own account, and because of its immediate accord or agreement with human sentiment and affection. (Hume 1912, Appendix 1)

It is an absurdity, Hume says, to push the questioning further. To do so would tip it into an infinite regress. We'd end up in a black hole from which something monstrous, something more ugly and destabilizing than the merely unreasonable, might pop out. Not just a white rabbit. Beyond unreasonable lies the realm of what does not accord with human affect. Somewhere in the infinite regress that we must avoid there lies the limit of what is AFFECTIVELY UNTHINKABLE: what we as humans think to be unfeelable. Viewed from the lip of the rabbit-hole, this impossible limit of human feeling is abject. But what if we do push past, in spite of that horror we feel as putative subjects of interest, to the "regressive endpoint" of human sentiment? What if we confront the abject question, Why should I prefer my pleasure over pain? So what if I prefer your well-being to mine? If the ultimate ends of human action can never, in any case, be accounted for by reason, then "it is not contrary to reason to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an Indian or a person wholly unknown to me" (Hume 1984, 2.3.3, 463).27 And in any case, aren't there even more horrific monstrosities that arise from self-interest? For neither is it "contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger" (ibid.). What prevents an individual from skirting around the human endpoint and spiralling into the beyond of its own self-interest? On the other hand, what prevents human self-interest itself from being taken to abject and monstrous extremes? 

Hume's explanation of why the endpoint is not regressive, and why the choices made there both serve the individual's interests and rebound for the common good, appeals to "natural sentiment." It is simply a characteristic of human nature to prefer pleasure over pain in all circumstances. One of the things that human nature obtains most pleasure from, Hume continues, is the approbation of others: what pleases others pleases us, and we benefit by the affective synergy because conventions of mutual benefit emerge from it ("general rules" of  conduct, "custom," "habit"). The reason that what pleases others pleases us has nothing to do with reason. It is in no way a calculation. Rather than a calculation, it grows from an "affectation." We are directly, affectively touched by the pleasure and pain of others. We literally feel their pleasure and pain through a direct "communication of sentiments" due to our natural faculty of SYMPATHY, "which makes us partake of the satisfaction of every one" (Hume 1984, 2.3.5, 407). "'Tis sympathy which is properly the cause of the affection" that establishes the communication between myself and others (2.3.5, 408). It works like this:  When any affection [of another, causing pain or pleasure] is infused by sympathy, it is at first known only by its effects, and by those external signs in the countenance and conversation, which convey an idea of it. This idea is presently converted into an impression, and acquires such a degree of force and vivacity, as to become the very passion itself, and produce an equal emotion, as any original affection. However instantaneous this change of the idea into an impression may be, it proceeds from certain views and reflections, which will not escape the strict scrutiny of a philosopher, though they may the person himself, who makes them. (Hume 1984, 2.1.11, 367-368).

The word "idea" should not mislead. For Hume, an idea is a type of PERCEPTION.28 This account of the transformation effected by sympathy is entirely compatible with the earlier discussion in this essay of perceptual judgment and abduction if the process is understood as a MUTUAL INCLUSION in the same event of differing modes of activity: affection, perception, impression, idea, passion. "Affection" is meant in the simple sense of a being-affected: an undergoing. A perception of another's affection gives rise to an idea of the other's pain or pleasure. The idea strikes me, and the force of the strike converts the idea into an impression. This yields a vivacity of feeling, which generates a passion—which I directly experience as an affection in me, of myself. All these modes must be seen as CO-OCCURRING "INSTANTANEOUSLY," fused into a single event occurring at a nonconscious level of immediate experience. The "communication" of the affective force of the other's experience into an affectation of my experience is no less direct for being multimodal. In the instant, the modes involved are in superposition—as are the other and me, in shared undergoing. The "views" and "reflections" are immanent to the sympathetic perception's arising.

Hume's concept of passion encapsulates this occurrent coming-together. He defines PASSION as the "double relation of ideas to impressions" (Hume 1984, 2.1.5, 338). A passion is when an affecting impression, and its "instantaneous" reflection in a simultaneously arising idea of the affection, fuse as two aspects of the same perceptual immediacy of experience. The event is then a DOUBLE RELATION BETWEEN THINKING AND FEELING, in the sense that a two-way circuit is established between them. In virtue of this, a passion can give rise to a sympathy, just as sympathy generates a passion (3.3.1., 627). In the back-and-forth, acquired tendencies may be created that work to mutual benefit (the "artificial virtues" of social convention; 3.3.1, 628). But already in the immediacy of the event, the thinking-feeling fusion launches a tendency: a self-driving of oriented activity. TENDENCY is part of the very definition of passion. With a passion, comes a vivacious "FACILITY FOR TRANSITION": activity more easily circulates among the modes of activity that come together in perception, and because of that can more readily transition into an acting out.30 PASSION IS ALREADY AN INCIPIENCE OF ACTION IN READINESS POTENTIAL. This means that perception is not only a thinking-feeling: it is an already-almost-doing thinking-feeling. It is a germinal fusion of action and perception: an INCIPIENT ACTION-PERCEPTION. More radically, not only social conventions but whole NEW PASSIONS may emerge from the "double impulse" provided by the emergence of the first-order passion (2.1.4, 336). Passion upon passion, in inventive proliferation, growing in a communicative contagion of actionable affectability. Hume's favorite word for what the force of passion does is "ACTUATE" (for example, 2.2.2, 393). Actuate: activate. The theory of perception, in its relation to understanding, is an activist philosophy. It would not be stretching it to equate the superpositional process of undergoing just described with "BARE ACTIVITY" coming to determinate expression. The bare activity that is the germ of experience's taking form is INSEPARABLE FROM SYMPATHY. Bare activity can be summed up as the TENDENCY FOR TENDENCIES to form and settle into the world, AS A FUNCTION OF SYMPATHY.

There is NO MEDIATION by the faculty of reason involved in the thinking-feeling process of sympathy. No subject of interest steps in. There is just the inventive complexity of the perceptual event, passing through me on the way to further transitions. The workings of reason come after the perception's genesis and the generative event, in the reflections of the philosopher in a moment of pause, or perhaps in the reflections of the person who was affected in all immediacy and now thinks back on the encounter at a remove. In the latter case, reason can inflect the process only if the thinking included in the feeling was for some reason off the mark. After all, "external signs" can be ambiguous. One way the process goes off the mark is when the perceived effect in the other's countenance or conversation that triggers the sympathetic process is erroneously attributed to the wrong object. For example, you might hurt someone by something you say, but you misconstrue which comment it was that caused the affection. The other way an error occurs is when the tendency that arises with the newly minted passion falls into the wrong groove, so that it is insufficient as a means of effecting the empassioned transition (Hume 1984, 2.3.3, 463). These errors are "false judgments"—FALSE PERCEPTUAL JUDGMENTS.31 Reason's only role is a reflective corrective to false perceptual judgments.

Hume has no patience for the standard rhetoric of the "COMBAT OF PASSION AND REASON" (Hume 1984, 3.1.3, 460-462). How could they enter into hand-to-hand combat when they really don't even touch? Reason holds itself at a reflective remove from the inventive life-process that comes flush with perception. Because of this, reason has no motive force. That is why it can't dictate that I should not prefer disaster for an other to a scratch on my little finger, or that I should not prefer my own pain to pleasure, potentially acting to the benefit of far-away other against my own self-interests.

"REASON ALONE CAN NEVER PRODUCE ANY ACTION, OR GIVE RISE TO VOLITIOn" (3.1.3, 460). There is simply no common ground between rationality and affectivity that can become a battle ground. "A PASSION IS AN ORIGINAL EXISTENCE, or, if you will, modification of existence, and contains not any representative quality, which renders it a copy of any other existence or modification" (ibid.). A thinking that contains a representative quality is what is referred to these days as a COGNITION, and as such belongs to reason. Passion, containing not any representative quality, is noncognitive. As a modification of existence, it is a becoming. Put the two together, and you get a NONCOGNITIVE BECOMING. As the processual hub around which tendencies grow, and grow into conventions of behavior that orient life activity, passion in of itself is TANTAMOUNT TO A VOLITION: its noncognitive becoming is an ONTOPOWER. 

This is where the issue of choice comes back in. Although a passion is a volition, it IS NOT A CHOICE: it is at the hub of a process that runs it course automatically, in the instant, without any intervention by a deciding subject. The process is self-deciding. Choice comes out between passions. It comes from passions entering into combat with other passions, tendencies with opposing or elsewise-oriented tendencies, in bare activity. "Nothing can oppose or retard the impulse of passion, but a contrary passion" (ibid.). In bare activity, passions duke it out among themselves, flush with perception, imbued with nonconscious thought, already potentially readying an issue in action. This affective thinking-feeling is not the opposite of rationality. It is not reducible to the simple negation of rationality. It may be NONRATIONAL, BUT IT IS NOT IRRATIONAL. The passion with which it comes is an "original existence." It is an original, tendentially self-affirming existence, and as such must be described in positive terms as its own ontopowerful process. 

Does that sound like a moral philosophy? If you add to this account the idea of priming and other forms of event-conditioning, and the wholesale modulation of the relational field effected by event-conditioning—including the potential for new, emergent action-paths to be invented—then what you have is much more like a politics: a FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECTIVE POLITICS. In the affective politics implied, rational choice has no foundational role or reality. Fundamentally, it's not about choice—it's about sympathy. And sympathy is in the immediate communication of affections between individuals: it is TRANSINDIVIDUAl.

This means that the individualism of self-interest also has no foundational role, despite Hume's own attempt to save it. At any rate, Hume doesn't seem convinced by his own argument that preferring pleasure over pain is an incontrovertible "natural sentiment" and that the approbation of others is naturally a pleasure, and that together they block any ungrounding approach to the regressive limit of the dividual, thus exorcising the possibility that out of the complex and uncertain oscillatory process of which the dividual is the inmost endpoint a decision might make itself that by the conventions of society would fall to an unacceptable extreme: either the callous extreme of preferring the destruction of the whole world to a slight discomfort of a little digit, or the opposite extreme of choosing my own total ruin to the slightest discomfort of a person on the other side of world who is totally unknown to me. Untempered by self-interest, sympathy would seem to move us naturally in the latter direction. In its own processual terms, there is no reason why a contagion of feeling of the kind Hume theorizes would not issue in actions expressing a preference for someone else's well-being over my own. With reason unable to give a motivation for why this should not be the case, the field would seem to be affectively weighted at least as much in this direction as toward callous disregard. 

Only systematic event-conditionings PRIMING FOR SELF-INTEREST could disarm this tendency, and they have their work cut out for them if they are to overcome in all cases the possibility of an "unnatural" outcome flowing from the formative role of sympathy in the very genesis of perception. It is no wonder neoliberalism keeps itself so busy touting the virtues of self-interest and implanting the presupposition that its denizens are subjects of rational choice, making all manner of maneuvers aimed at instilling transitions that make self-interested rational choice the dominant tendency. It is also no wonder—given reason's Humean impotence, on top of the necessary blindness of the subject of interest that Foucault sees as freeing the invisible hand of the market—that this tendency of neoliberalism to foster tendencies of self-interested rational chioce leads to the paradoxes of decision described earlier, as exemplified in deliberation-without-attention and choice-blindness. Oddly, given his skepticism toward religion, Hume appeals to the trump card of the "Supreme Will" to save some semblance of a solid foundation for self-interested choice, in what can only be read as an implicit admission that the argument from natural sentiment needs other-worldly reinforcement and is in the end no less convincing than its rivals: on the one hand, the argument that there is a combat of affectivity and reason and that reason wins; and on the other the specter of sympathy taken to unthinkable extremes.33 Invisible hands, it seems, have a finger in many liberal pies, of both economic and philosophic confection. 
What do invisible hands do when their finger gets scratched?

Contiguity, Most Distant

A key part of Hume's theory of the moderating, regulatory effect of natural sentiment is the argument by similarity: "we find, that where, beside the general resemblance of our natures, there is any peculiar similarity in our manners, or character, or country, or language, it facilitates the sympathy" (Hume 1984, 2.1.11, 368). Where there is difference, the familiarity bred by "contiguity" creates the conditions for sympathy (2.1.11, 369). According to these arguments, there is a hierarchy of sympathy based on established patterns of belonging, according to general kind (for example, the human solidarity of membership in the same species and class solidarities) or owing to the particularities of frequentation (family, community, nation): RESEMBLANCE/FAMILIARITY/CONTIGUITY-BASED SOLIDARITIES.

Although it may be generally the case that sympathy is preferentially structured in this way, there are enough exceptions to the general rule to raise once again the question of what might happen if the constant conditionings aimed at implanting this hierarchy were not in force. Under neoliberalism's "massive withdrawal" from the normative-disciplinary regime of power, hierarchizing conditionings of sympathy lose their anchoring in easily controllable enclosures. They are forced to operate in an open, oscillatory environmental field. This biases them toward the extremes. In order to retain resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based criteria for sympathetic belonging, affective primings are necessary to suppress or demonize the perception of difference. Given the proliferative nature of capitalism, and its ontopowerful tendency to augment differencings (the better to invent niche markets), virulent primings tending toward FASCIST contagion are required to shore up the sense of identity and reimpose boundaries. This can be seen in the rise of the far right in the United States, beginning with the formal setting in place of the financial mechanisms of the neoliberal economy starting in the late 1970s, and now affecting all areas of Europe, in particular since the destruction of what remained of the social democratic model by the crash of 2007-2008 and the subsequent policies of austerity brutally imposing an abrupt transition to a fully fledged neoliberal model. On the other hand, and at the same time, unleashed from the normative-disciplinary hegemony over the field of relation characterizing the previous phase of capitalism, sympathetic tendencies uninclined toward resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based hierarchies readily multiply, and go feral, against the grain of "natural sentiment."

These feral "PARTICIPATIONS AGAINST NATURE" take a number of expressions.34 Against general resemblance of kind, the early 2000s have been marked by a sea-change in perceptions of species-difference. There has been a passionate upsurge of concern, academic and activist, in nonhuman forms of life, inventive of new cross-species tendencies in the playing out of sympathy. Parallel to this, the geography of the field of relation has been fundamentally changed by the internet and social media, redistributing perceptions of contiguity and familiarity. Viral contagions rage on a daily basis, irrespective of distance or prior familiarity. In the network socieity, what is farthest away can hit closest to home. Conversely, one's immediate surroundings may seem oddly far away, affectively distanced by the intensities of experience communicated by free-roaming viralities.35 Examples of feral sympathy become a major social-media trope: images of "random acts of kindness," tales of "paying it forward," unexpected odd-couple bonds between individuals who have nothing in common or between animals of different species, cultural oddities that strike with sympathy-clinching affection in ways those experiencing it could never justify by any prevailing standards of tastes, to name just a few. On a more mainstream note, the media rhetoric of the everyday "hero" who actively accepts the possibility of his or her own total ruin to the misfortune of another, has become an inescapable daily presence, particularly since 9/11.

On the callous extreme of lack of sympathy for others, we see, in addition to what a normative point of view would consider "anti-social" actions by individuals, widespread collective attitudes that are actually based on what is purported to be "rational" economic reasoning. These are perhaps best understood less as a lack of sympathy per se, than A SYMPATHY FOR THE MARKET, of the kind corporate persons and enterprise-subjects are primed to feel—and to feel to be accordance with their own best interests as well as ultimately, in the long run of accumulating multiplier effects, to be in the common good. Most notable among these market-sympathies, or passions for the capitalist process itself—capital desires—are callousness toward the disadvantaged, expressed in policies to roll back social benefits for the love of the bottom line, and attitudes toward climate change and other ecological devastations. Do not the unapologetically obstructionist climate politics of some of the most economically developed countries, in particular Australia, Canada, and the United States, amount in the long run to preferring the destruction of the whole world to an economic scratch on the finger of the market's invisible hand?

Given this situation, the argument that natural sentiment grounds the passions in self-interest—but also trustably regulates sympathy according to principles of resemblance in kind, familiarity, and contiguity—seems disingenuous. Trustably? No reason to get started on that again. If this principle of "human nature" was ever in force, its force is noticeably enfeebled in our day.

The Argument from Intensity

The relative flattening out of the bell curve of sympathy, as the extremes of the spectrum gain currency, should not be understood to imply that more people become personally invested in taking pleasure in the pain of others, at the callous extreme, or at the other extreme, in experiencing pain in deference to other's pleasure. It is NOT A QUESTION OF SADISM OR OF MASOCHISM. And it should be clear by now that affectivity has to do not with personal, subjective investments, but rather with autonomies of decision that can be only said to reside in the relational field in its unspecified, oscillatory whole—or to be more precise, in the movements of dividual-transindividual cross-scale sensitivity traversing the relational field, communicating affections in a way that decidedly cuts the flows at each pass, effecting singular events of perceptual judgment that issue into action. THE PROBLEM IS THE VERY NOTION THAT THE HEDONIC FACTORS OF PAIN AND PLEASURE ULTIMATELY GROUND CHOICE, AND ORIENT SYMPATHY'S PRODUCTION OF PASSION-fueled, self-willing tendency. 

The alternative to grounding decision and volition in the hedonic distinction between pain and  pleasure is to introduce the category of INTENSITY into the affective picture. Intensity is nonhedonic. It is not a subjective state expressing an affective investment of the person. It is a DIMENSION OF EVENTS into which the life of the body is braced. The intensity of an event is the bracingness of its qualitative tenor: what Hume calls its "vivacity" or "LIVELINESS." Hume always speaks of the vivacity of a phenomenon in terms of degrees. Intensity is not binary, like pain/pleasure, but lies on a continuum. Hume never speaks of vivacity as a STATE, always as a FORCE. The vivacity or intensity of an impression or an idea makes it more affecting, and thus more forcefully effective as an generator of passion and tendency. The concept of intensity is a strange one, by the usual hedonic standards. It is the notion of a QUALITATIVE FORCE immanent to events that gives them their power to effect transitions: their decisional power to make a cut that continues the flow of events. INTENSITY IS WHAT AFFECTIVE VOLITION FEELS LIKE. Its motive force is clearly not beholden to self-interest. It is in the service of the liveliness it is. It's all about VITALITY, AS A SELF-AFFIRMING VALUE, expressed as a power to effect transitions in the world. An event of uncommon intensity produces A SURPLUS-VALUE OF LIFE: a boost of vitality that is communicated by sympathy, and tendentially spreads, affirming itself in and as a power of contagion. INTENSITY LIES AT THE BASIS OF ONTOPOWER. It is the qualitative force boosting of becoming. For as we saw earlier, new passions, corresponding to emergent tendencies, invent themselves through the affective process of sympathy's playing out.

Whitehead adds an essential element: CONTRAST (Whitehead 1967, 252-264; Whitehead 1978, 162-163, 279-280). What determines the intensity of an experience, he says, are the contrasts it holds together. In other words, AN INTENSITY IS A MEASURE OF THE MUTUAL INCLUSION OF WHAT UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES TENDS TO SEPARATE OUT. Certain events suspend the contrariety of what is normally present as mutually exclusive terms. The more such contrasts an experience is capable of holding in itself, the more intense it is. Because the "terms" are actually tendencies. Objects, perceptual forms and qualities of all kinds, operate as TRIGGERS for the coming activity, already incipiently stirring in the dawning of an experience. They figure as SIGNS OF AN EMERGENT PASSION potentially coming to determine a tendency (recall that Hume's account of the genesis of passion in sympathy began with the strike of a sign). The terms that are held together in their contrast, but minus their contrariety, stand in the incipient experience for co-possible tendencies that elsewhere, in other experiences, will refuse to cohabit. They are present as COMPOSSIBILITIES: co-present alternatives as to which transitions might potentially follow. Or, to return to the bull example, as alternative action-paths, experienced all at once and in their difference from each other, in the form of immediate perceptual judgments and the abductions into which they no sooner extrapolate (lived hypotheses directly experienced in the genesis of the perception). It is the packing into the event of a greater array of compossible tendential unfoldings that intensifies it. Simply put, the more contrasts are held in readiness potential, the more full of life the experience is—the more bracingly bare-active it is, the more lively, the more vital. The more surplus-value of life it produces. The more ample its affective wave-packet. 

It was asserted earlier that a politics of affect would be a political art. Whitehead defines the achievement of intensity as definitive of the AESTHETIC DIMENSION of existence (Whitehead 1978, 109, 197, 213, 244, 279-280). Art would then be the practice OF PACKING AN EXPERIENCE WITH CONTRASTS, AND HOLDING THEM IN SUSPENSE IN A COMPOSITION OF SIGNS: contriving for the affective wave-packet not to collapse, for an intensive interval. This is achieved through the way in which the event of perception is conditioned: which presuppositions are implanted and how; which tendencies are activated, in what rhythm, and in what abductive tension; and what new passions and emergent tendencies potentially arise from that tension. It is in this sense that an artwork is creative: in the manner in which it potentially invents new passions and tendencies. It is not the artist who is creative. CREATIVITY is not a subjective state. It is a manner of activity, passing through the life of the artist. It always expresses as an inventive event. 

An affective art of politics would similarly pack experience with contrasts, at the strike of a sign, or a composition of signs. It would also hold the actuated tendencies in suspense, trying not to allow the affective wave-packet to collapse in a way that would determine quanta of satisfaction and success to sort out—at least not right away, or in any way assimilable to a calculus of interests. Once again, interest is not fundamentally ingredient to the event's occurrence. Sympathy is its mode. However, as new passions and tendencies emerge and settle into the world, interests will inevitably grow up around the settlements. Far from interest being primary, it is INTENSITIES OF EXPERIENCE THAT GIVE RISE TO INTERESTS. Interests are the settled creatures of intensity. They are invented by affective means foreign to their own dynamic of avoiding pain and seeking pleasure. Hume, and the neoliberals, got it backwards. Satisfaction does not come at the end, arrived at by following one's own interest. It comes en route, in the SELF-AFFIRMING VALUE OF THE PROCESS ITSELF. It comes in the immediate experience of a qualitative "more" to life, a surplus-value of life that is lived intensely, such that its very living is its own reward. To call this satisfaction is to belittle it, so different it is from hedonic satisfaction, and so much more vital. Spinoza's term is best: JOY. Joy is much more than a pleasure. It registers the invention of new passions, tendencies, and action-paths that expand life's powers, flush with perception. It registers becoming. It is an immediate thinking-feeling of powers of existence, in passionate intensification and tendential increase.

Joy, understood in this sense, does not map onto pleasure. It can carry a mix of pleasure and pain, or any number of contrastive EMOTIONS. It doesn't map onto any particular emotion either, or onto any particular contrastive emotional pairing. It is the liveliness factor of all hedonic and emotional categories. It is not an emotion: it is VITALITY AFFECT (Stern 1985, 53-61; Massumi 2011, 43-44, 111, 152-153; Massumi 2014). There is an infinite variety of vitality affects. Every event of perception has its own vitality affect, with its own qualitative tenor and tendential force—its own degree of intensity. In this sense, every experience is its own joy. An emotion is a subjective state. A joy is a dividual-transindividual expression of life's potential inventiveness.

Whitehead goes so far as to say that the increase in intensity is the ULTIMATE AIM OF LIFE—even of the "universe" (Whitehead 1967, 201; Whitehead 1978, 107).

Hume also understands his account of the affective genesis of experience in aesthetic terms. But in keeping with his time, he considered the fundamental category of the aesthetic to be TASTE, not intensity. He understood the object of taste to be BEAUTY (a "gilding or staining of the object"), not the thinking-feeling of powers of existence under increase. In keeping with his doctrine of the nonrelation between affectivity and reason, he does not assimilate taste to judgment. He maintains an affective account of it. But for him that means consigning it, and with it the aesthetic as a whole, to the hedonic binary of pleasure and pain. He does, however, recognize taste as a motive force. Suggestively, he also recognizes it as "a productive faculty" that "raises in a manner a new creation." But the manner of creation it raises is a "sentiment" attached to the attainment of a new pleasure, or a familiar pleasure of rare "gilding." This obviates any politics of the aesthetic, returning his thinking to the realm of moral philosophy, albeit of a thoroughly constructivist slant stripped of any foundational "ought" and excluding any appeal to a priori categories of judgment. (All quotations in this paragraph are form Hume 1912, Appendix 1).

If joy must be distinguished from pleasure and satisfaction, and divorced from taste, it must also be saved from a final indignity: being mistaken for INSTANT GRATIFICATION. It is true that instant gratification is an activity that is entered into for its own sake, and is self-affirming. But it is consuming, not creative. But it is really is just one half of neoliberalism's paradoxes of self-interested satisfaction. Instant gratification (get it while you can, before the next crisis wipes you out) and the deferral of satisfaction (the "rational" calculus that it would be wiser in the long run to defer gratification) are two sides of the same neoliberal coin. They are an INFERNAL ALTERNATIVE: the "choice" between them binds you to the presupposition that you are effectively a subject of interest, whichever way you choose to go.37 It binds you to the hedonic dynamic of life, in its neoliberal expression, and as such is catastrophic from the point of view of the intensification of existence. Satisfaction, associated with consumption, is DEINTENSIFYING. Instead of holding the contrariety of contrasts in tension, it suspends the tension—thus losing the contrasts. It relieves tension, stilling tendency in a moment of entropic equilibrium that seems to offer succor in the oscillating seas of the stormy economic field of relation. Consumptive satisfaction is the ANTI-AESTHETIC OF CAPITALISM.

This is not to say that there is no possibility of joy arising in capitalism. There are intensities aplenty, and joys may even be found in consumption. The intensities potentially register counter-tendencies, and the joys of consumption are had by making a creative art of it, against the equilibrium-seeking impulse toward entropic satisfaction, instant or deferred. This can be seen, for example, in fan cultures, DIY cultures, hacking cultures, and culture-jamming activities, all of which turn consumption back around into productive activity. In all of these cases, a dividual-transindividual dynamic is affirmed and inflected, even if it is not explicitly thought of in those terms. The "subject" of the practices is collective, and the collective tendency is to invent new tendencies, in viral contagion. The object of consumption is reactivated, and reactuates, as a sign of passion (a sign that strikes in such a way as to give rise to a passion, and potentially to the invention of new passions to follow). Sympathy reasserts its rights as a force of existence. There are stirrings of joy. It is in virtue of this collective reaffirmation of sympathy-based passion as a "productive faculty" and a joy, that arts of consumption register counter-tendencies. This does not constitute a politics per se, but neither is it business as usual. 

The Other as Sign of Passion

To move sympathy further toward the political, it is sufficient to reconsider the role of the other in Hume's account of the genesis of sympathy. His account begins when a sign of an affection undergone by the other strikes me, triggering a passional process in which the affection communicates itself to me. In order to contain the movement of sympathy within the ambit of "natural sentiment," Hume is obliged to interpret the sign as a sign of the other's pain or pleasure. This needs to revised, in light of the all of the ways just enumerated in which the affective process triggered by the sign overspills the hedonic dimension of experience. 

Conveyed with the affection, mutually included in its vivacity, are incipient actions and buds of tendency. THE SIGN OF THE OTHER ACTUATES THESE. Your passion is the movement of their actuation. You are braced into a complexity of unresolved contrasts and alternate outcomes, all intensely thought-felt flush with the perception. The vitality affect of the event is the registering of this complexity, as exceeding any particular pole of contrast, contrastive pair, or determinate outcome. The multiplicity of modes of activity, further multiplied by the co-presenting of alternate runnings of each, produces an untenable tension. The tension is the churning of the dividual, in bare activity. Only an issue in action will resolve the tension. Only one action can effectively unfold. This NEED FOR A REDUCTION OF THE AFFECTIVE WAVE-PACKET itself produces an additional tension: between the bracingness of the instant and the future resolution, in the course of which the experience will be determined to distance itself from the germinal vivacity of its overfullness with contrast, incipiency, and tendency, as well as the vaguely but vitally sensed possibility of the invention of new passions and their attendant tendencies.

The sign of the other that triggers this affective process and its passional playing-out has a double sense, corresponding to the two tensions, that of the arising of a field of overfull potential, and between that arising and its resolving playing-out. What the SIGN OF THE OTHER stands for points in two directions. On the one hand, it points to the ACTUATED LANDSCAPE OF POTENTIAL just described. This is not the landscape that the other inhabits. It is NOT ANOTHER'S HOME TERRITORY. Rather, IT IS THE LANDSCAPE THAT INHABITS THE OTHER: the array of co-present passions and tendential action-perceptions actuated by the sign the other emits. The landscape of potential does not inhabit the other so much as it comes between the other and me, actuated in the communication of affectability that moves instantaneoulsy from the other to me, and in the so moving directly moves me. IT INHABITS THIS MOVING RELATION. The moving-relation is in the hyphen of the dividual-transindividual: my life is braced into bare activity by the transindividual movement of transition. The strike in the infra- of the dividual and the trans-affection from the other are one: two instantaneous poles of same relational movement. 

However, since it is the other that emitted the sign that triggers the movement, our engrained associative HABITS OF PERCEPTION are apt to assign THE OTHER AS CAUSE OF THE EVENT. The landscape of potential is then attributed to the other, and the tendency is then to construe it as belonging to the other. The affective communication now no longer appears as an immediate relation bringing about a transition between events: the other's affection and its eventual issuing forth in my actions as a function of sympathy. It is experienced instead as the transmission to me of a content of the other's life. As if the other and me were separate interiorities—rather than cross-sensitive, trans-correlated (in)dividualities. The landscape of potential is then experienced as the sign of a POSSIBLE WORLD that is subjective in nature.

It is upon this basis that LOVE and HATE arise. Spinoza defines love as a "joy with the accompanying idea of an external cause," and hate as "a sadness with the accompanying idea of an external cause" (with sadness defined as a diminution of the powers of existence enveloped in intensity, and interpreted in the present essay as lying on the same continuum as joy rather than being its opposite; Spinoza 1985, 3, P13, schol., 502). It is also upon this basis that the linking of sympathy to Hume's good friends, resemblance, familiarity, and contiguity, occurs. The interiorization of the affective event coincides with the transition from immediately-thinkingly-feelingly-lived to reflectively-thought. A POTENTIAL is bracingly experienced. It is nonconscious. A POSSIBILITY, for its part, can be consciously cogitated upon. Love and hate give rise to endless ruminations: scenarios of conquest and revenge, the strategems by which they might be obtained. Obtained—as satisfactions. It is also here that the hedonic duality between pleasure and pain kicks in in a way that begins to structure one's life in what almost inevitably plays out along conventional lines—too often embarrassingly clichéd lines—due to the relentless priming dedicated toward just this end. Love and hate are emotions corresponding to the interiorization of the affective event as a hedonic subjective content amenable to conventional formatting. As with all emotions, this containment of affective intensity is never complete. All emotions carry a remainder of intensity, to which they owe their vivacity—as well as their etymology ("e-mote": to move out of oneself, as in the phrase "to be beside oneself"). There is a quantum of joy even in hatred. Intensity cuts across the hedonic duality, on a transversal path of its own.

Thus in one direction, the sense of the sign of the other is a landscape of potential that tends to be translated into a possible world. Enveloped in the strike of the sign, mutually included with the potential it actuates, there is a world of subjective emotion in the key of possibility. 

This points to the second sense of the other as sign of passion: possibility points to the FUTURE. The strike of the sign affectively braces me for an unfolding in the course of which passions will be produced, tendencies will duke it out, and actions will issue. All of this occurs in the instant, nonconsciously, in perceptual judgment and abduction, in infra-trans cross-sensitivity, through what Simondon calls an unmediated "communication of subsconsciouses" (Simondon 2005, 249). The trans- communication CORRELATES my affective dividuality—my "preindividuality" in Simondon's vocabulary—with that of another. Our preindividualities differentially participate in the same event, as immediately linked polarities defining its strike. Enveloped in this transindividual correlation between preindividualities is the translation of the potential actuated in the event into the key of cogitative possibility. The bifurcation from affection to emotion, from joy to love, from in-between intensity to subjective content, and from perceptual judgment and abduction to reflective rumination, is included in the affective wave-packet of the event's readiness potential, in tendential bud. The future may unfold according to either path—or even following both, on parallel tracks. Simondon speaks of the "affectivo-emotive" in order to encompass this coming-together of this bifurcation (Simondon 2005, 247). From this perspective, on either or both tracks, THE SIGN OF THE OTHER IS A SIGN OF MY RELATION TO MY OWN FUTURE. This is why the sense of the other as sign of passion is double: in the event, it is both the immediate moving-relation, irreducibly infra-trans-, and my own affectivo-emotive self-relation, across the change the event will bring to my life. My infra-trans relation to the other IS my relation to myself, under two different but co-occurring aspects, in the two contrasting keys of life's polyphony: potentiation and possibilization.

When we speak of a politics of affect, or a politics of dividualism against neoliberal individualism, we are speaking of holding the event to the key of potential, to the extent possible. We are talking about making an abductive practice of perceptual judgment, bringing into relief the other as a sign of passion in ways that tend less easily to bifurcate toward conventionalized emotions and the general rules of social behavior they facilitate based on resemblance/familiarity/contiguity, as linked to the hedonic opposition between pleasure and pain. We are talking about intensity of moving-relation. We are talking about joy. We are talking about PASSION AS AN ONTOPOWER PRIMED FOR OPEN-ROAD BECOMING, veering off the beaten paths of conventional settlement. We are talking about the feral potential of sympathy, unleashed from the domination of self-interest and the exclusive aim of personal satisfaction. We are talking about life, enlivened, with its full charge of infra-trans cross-sensitivities. We are talking about the aim of life toward intensity, toward the production of qualitative surplus-values of experience. We are talking about RELATIONS TO THE OTHER THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY SELF-RELATIONS TO THE FUTURE. We are talking about reclaiming the future for collective potential.

Not forgetting that CAPITAL itself is defined in relation to the future. Capital is not a quantifiable sum of money. It is a potential quantitative increase in the future of a sum of money invested now. This potential increase is surplus-value. Surplus-value is "realized" in profit taken (rather than being rolled forward back into investment-capital). Profit, of course, is countable. Although surplus-value is not in itself quantitative, it is QUANTIFIABLE IN THE FORM OF PROFIT. Capitalism is the CAPTURE OF THE FUTURE for the production of quantifiable surplus-value. CAPITALISM IS THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING QUALITATIVE SURPLUS-VALUE OF LIFE INTO QUANTIFIABLE SURPLUS-VALUE. 

To the extent that our lives come to be dedicated to this conversion, our futures are captured by the capitalist process. We are consigned to live out our lives as human-capital, subjects of interest dedicated to the aim of obtaining pleasure rather than suffering pain—and suffering as a result of that the paradoxes of self-interest. As subject to those paradoxes, we are infernally burned by the alternative between instant gratification and the deferral of satisfaction. Given all the uncertainty associated with those paradoxes, we are beholden to exercise our gut-feeling to make our choices—but to do it in a way that brings the same result as a rational calculation would, knowing full that this is impossible for us, creatures that we are of the double involuntary of the neoliberal field of relation, becoming in a rhythm with its oscillatory process, affectively exposed to the ebb and flow of the unspecified whole of the world. This depresses us. To the point that some have made DEPRESSION the emblem of the times (Berardi 2011). If we weren't in depression already, the thought of depression as the emblem of the times is in itself enough to depress anyone. Apologists for the human-capitalization of life respond with …

"HAPPINESS ECONOMICS." Happiness economics deals with the paradox of self-interest produced by the tension between the "rational" imperative to defer satisfaction to maximize one's human capital in the long run, and the moment-to-moment need to act now, in fear and uncertainty, in the thick of the neoliberal field of relation's far-from-equilibrium conditions. The paradox is that the tension between the two can easily lead a unit of human-capital to throw up its all-too-visible hands and say, why not get what I can while I can? Instant gratification is better than working my life away for a pension that will be "austerity-ed" away before I can ever collect it. You can always bank on bankruptcy—and start the process all over again. In our capitalist day and age, isn't the subject of interest really just a polite term for the subject of debt in any case? (Lazzarato 2012). Or, on a less callous note: I'm going to concentrate on my quality of life, put time into my family and kids, my art or sports or pastimes, the kinds of things that I experience as having a value in themselves, and take the risk of being caught short later—which given the fact that the subject of interest is really the subject of debt is just as likely to happen anyway if I "rationally" calculate. 

Happiness economics responds to this by purporting to have discovered "the happiness equation" (Powdthavee 2010, 11). The happiness equation is a method for putting a MONETARY PRICE ON THE INTANGIBLES of experience from which we derive satisfaction. These are, in the main, modes of relation that we consider to the quality of our lives to hinge on, and to define "who we are" more than what we do for a living. Friendship and comaraderie, love and life-partnering, and personal health are at the top of the list. If economics can manage to quantify these relational values, it will have achieved the conversion of the citizen into an effectively satisfaction-fueled subject of interest, and of qualitative surplus-value of life into quantitative surplus-value. It will have completed the MONETIZATION OF EXISTENCE that is the project of human-capital. Affectivity will finally be subsumed to rational calculation. Unfortunately for these latter-day prophets of neoliberalism, outside economics and aside from its popularizing cheer-leaders, as few believe in this "equation" as believe in the well-groundedness of rational-choice theory. 

The work of happiness economics is made even more difficult by the paradoxical fact that studies consistently find that levels of self-reported happiness and life-satisfaction rise as incomes and standards of living rise above poverty level—but then level off and begin to decline beyond a fairly comfortable middle-class socio-economic status (see for example Potro and Rustichini 2013). This strange anomaly of the "happiness index" even has a name: the "Easterlin Paradox." It's not just that money doesn't necessarily make you happy—it's statistically guaranteed to make you less happy the more you have of it. The rebound effect on the dividual level is the associated fact that nonconscious PRIMING WITH IMAGES OF MONEY makes the following experience less satisfying (Quiodback et al. 2010). This is even the case for chocolate, the fabled pick-me-up of today's depressed units of human capital. The soothing pleasure of consuming chocolate and the taste of money don't mix. 

Why not let the qualitative surplus-values of life that are lived for their own worth stay what they essentially are, as corroborated by just about anyone's gut feeling: unquantifiable? WHAT ABOUT AN INTENSITY POLITICS, AS AGAINST A HAPPINESS ECONOMICS? Going that non-neoliberal route would involve tweaking and amplifying tendencies that intuitively understand the other as a sign of passion, and the relationship to the other that is immediately a self-relation, as an actuation of collective potential. It would involve as well inventing new tendencies that enable infra-trans cross-sensitivities to settle into frequentable action-paths in the world, as alternatives to the infernal alternatives of capitalism. Such a politics would be less grounded in the MACRO-POLITICS of PARTY PROGRAMS or IDEOLOGY-BASED CRITIQUE and resistance, than it would pivot on affirmative affective practices of event-conditioning and priming. It would not be conducted in the name of any individual's self-interest, or even in the name of any resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based group interest. It would reside in the intensive-collective affections of the unspecifiable whole of the relational field, oscillating itself toward a possible world of its own abductive invention, beyond neoliberal capitalism. Its power would be of affective contagion, for an ever-always qualitatively-more to life. 

Any human act accomplished at the level of transindividuality is endowed with an indefinite power of propagation that confers upon it a virtual immortality. (Simondon 2005, 249)

A Freedom of the Event

There are inklings of this potential for non-self-interested becomings in one of the most abject figures of contemporary capitalist culture: the "ordinary hero." The ordinary hero is thoroughly recuperated into rhetorics priming for resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based politics. Ordinary heros instill pride in country and community. Anyone might turn out to be one. They might look just like me. There might even be one living next door. We are all bathed in their second-hand glow. Their self-sacrifice elevates us. They achieve immortality. (The proof of it is that the pious celebrations of their martyrdom never end.) We feel our own lives have been given meaning. They will have been worth living thanks to our belonging to their kind. The ordinary kind: just human. Or … is it, the American kind? But what about the "first-responder" kind? Or the neighborhood-of-origin kind? All of the above—in a most satisfying confusion of structural levels.

Of course, the immortality is purely SYMBOLIC, not "virtual" (in a contagion of readiness potential rolling across the transition between events). Furthermore, the satisfaction to be had in the structural confusion of macro-levels energizes a politics that easily settles into a defense of group self-interests perceived to be under attack. The production of the ordinary hero is a working part of the politics of "terror." It has its own powers of affective propagation, revolving around the operative logic of preemption (Massumi 2007). Ordinary heros help implant in the field of relation an AFFECTIVE MEDIA-BORNE POLITICS that mass-converts intensity into emotion, in the politically useful register of fear, in oscillatory opposition to the contrasting emotion. That contrasting emotion is not trust, but the politically as well as economically useful emotion of chest-beating "confidence" (Massumi 2005). Who can forget the first responses of the time's most prominent public figures to the 9/11 attacks: 1) keep shopping, for love of country!41 and, 2) hate those swarthy foreign terrorists and hang on! because we're going on the preemptive attack. Don't lose confidence! This affective politics reinforces warlike tendencies toward neoconservatism, in tight processual embrace with the neoliberal economy (Massumi 2009a).

And yet … the ordinary hero did "choose" to feel something that it is ordinarily unthinkable. And she did it in the heat of the event, launched instantaneously into action by the sign of the life-threateing affection of the other. Heroic individuals are invariably portrayed as not consciously choosing. They rush headlong into the towering inferno, without pausing to ruminate for even a millisecond. They abduct themselves into risking their own life, braced into the intensity of an event that is far bigger than their small lives. The transition from the (in this case indexical) sign of the other's predicament to a decisive issue in action is accomplished in no time at all. The "heroic" cut into the flow of the event happens so quickly that the strike of the sign, its registering in an impression arousing an affection producing a passion actuating a tendency issuing into action—all of that barely registers. Or rather, only bare-actively registers, in the dividual recesses of a soon-to-be heroic life (in other words, a self-less death). A nonconscious decision has been made. The hero has been infra-trans-ed into action. THE CHOICE WAS MADE THROUGH HIM—BY THE RELATIONAL EVENT. Those who survive almost invariably describe it that way: I just ran into the wreckage, without even thinking about whether to do it or not, I just had an image of others on the brink of disaster, their lives about to be incinerated and the heart ripped out of their loved ones. A world of possibility about to go up in smoke. So much potential, about to be buried in rubble. What choice did I have? In other words: "I" DIDN'T DO IT—SYMPATHY DID IT. I was but its volitional vehicle, fueled by the other as sign of passion. 

The ordinary hero is MOVED BY THE RELATION OF SYMPATHY AS A MOTIVE FORCE, IN THE FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENT OF VOLITION. They didn't do it—the event did it, in the playing out of the double sympathetic tension of the relation-to-the-other-that-IS-a-self-relation that is one with its occurrence. It just happened. 

Yes, these ordinary heroes are just like you or me. There is nothing extraordinary in their makeup that separated them out from us by nature before the event. Their distinction is to have acted on gut feeling without a moment's hesitation in the heat of the event. IT IS THE EVENT THAT MADE THEM EXTRAORDINARY. They can only claim to have been bathed in the glow of its exceptional nature. They are haloed by the glow only because they surrendered themselves to the event. They opened their lives to it, such that what was to become of them, who they would be in the end, COINCIDED WITH ITS "INTERESTS": its freedom to play itself out as it will. 

If these are indeed just circumstantially extraordinary ordinary people, then all of us have it potentially within us to do this. We must all be susceptible to the tendency, to one degree or another. We all have it in us—in the inmost recesses of our dividuality—to surrender ourselves to the event. TO "CHOOSE," through an autonomy of decision deciding through us, for our life's potential to COINCIDE WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN EVENT, AGAINST our own considered choice, beyond our own best interests. How intense is that?

Of course, we all also have in us the contrasting tendency to self-preservation and the self-interested pursuit of happiness, guaranteed for US citizens by the Constitution. But there is ANOTHER CONSTITUTION: THAT OF BARE ACTIVITY. That constitution is not just institutionally powerful. It is ontopowerful. At the "endpoint" of the subject of interest, the two tendencies, to coincide with the freedom of an event and the tendency to assert our personal freedom as subjects of interest duke it out, mutually included in the superpositions of bare activity. When the event-conditions are such that the tendency to self-interest comes out of the churning of bare activity on top, the conventional social settlements clinch back into place, and the action-paths followed pass for the results of a "rational calculation." In affective fact, as we have seen over and over again in this exploration of the paradoxes of self-interest, IT IS STILL THE EVENT THAT HAS DECIDED, through an autonomy of decision, issuing out of the double involuntary of the oscillatory complexity of the field of relation. Selfishness is an achievement of the relational field's neoliberal tendency. When that tendency comes out on top, we live up to the systemically desired vocation as human-capital that has been presuppositionally implanted in the economy, and is continually reprimed. When the contrary tendency comes out on top, we have participated in an alter-economic ontopower—even if our action is in the next instant recuperated by the neoconservative politics in processual embrace with the capitalist economy. For a brief moment that passed faster than the smallest consciously thinkable interval, we lived a counter-powerful affection. 

This occurred in a cross-sensitivity braced into action by an EVENT WHOSE SCALE DWARFS THE HUMAN SCALE. Far from engaging our "natural sentiment," the event's deciding was nothing less than monstrous. Even if the setting is not as physically out-of-scale as the World Trade Towers, it was still excessive. The sense of it is still out of sync with the human scale of the everyday decisions passing through our ordinary lives: it something that it is HUMANLY UNTHINKABLE TO FEEL, AND HUMANLY UNFEELABLE TO THINK. You could say that it's sublime, if such is your philosophical inclination. You could also say it's wondrous—in a paradoxical, down-the-rabbit-hole kind of way. Or maybe, just quirky.

In any case, what has occurred has issued from the "regressive endpoint" of the human: that "INTERIOR ALTERITY" at our sympathetic endpoint (Lapoujade 2010, 68). It has come of something nonpersonal stirring at the inmost endpoint of the relational field, at the limit of the human capital we all are now—that is, that we all are to the extent that we are human and in the thrall of the paradox of our "natural sentiments." To the extent that a freedom-of-the-event has lived itself out through us, we have lived a counter-power: a participation-against-nature. The tendency in that direction is as much a part of our nature as any other. It is beyond the pale of "our" nature. It is an against-the-grain expression of the inhuman part in us, issuing into action. It is, simply, "NATURE," with no possessive—self-possessing. It is nature defined as THE BARE-ACTIVE RESERVE OF ACTIONABLE POTENTIAL IN THE WORLD (Massumi 2009a), issuing in excessive becomings expressing an autonomy of decision. At bottom, nature is world's tendency to grow feral again. Pat patriotic rhetoric aside, the ordinary hero, seen from the angle of the dividual in its transindividual cross-sensitivity, IS AN EXPRESSION OF THE INHUMAN AND THE NONPERSONAL IN US. If "heroism" is a virtue, it is a NONPERSONAL AND NONHUMAN VIRTUE OF THE RELATIONAL EVENT. However recuperated, it is a sign of the potential for feral becomings, done through me, beyond the human-capital pale, churning out from the inmost end of the relational field of life. 

It's a bit kitschy to call a self-deciding nonhuman virtue of the relational event "heroism," especially when the same tendency can take any number of minor expressions, so as to pass almost unnoticed. For example, anywhere a gratuitous act of generosity or kindness or feral connection comes about, without the vehicle it moves through even pausing to think about it, a mini-event has sympathetically decided itself, cutting modestly into the flow of everyday life. "Ordinary" events can express a freedom-of-the-event just as much as "ordinary hero" events, but moving through with little or no fanfare. Pat humanistic rhetoric aside, these events are also just as much expressions of the inhuman in us. 

Freedom-of-the-event comes in all sizes and in various degrees of vivacity, or affective force. The variety is as infinite as that of vitality affect. However small the splash, however fleeting or fading, its vital intensity still surpasses that of the grandest of self-interested gestures.  As well, by the way, as that of even the most celebrated of acts of ALTRUISM performed with the aim, conscious or not, of obtaining the satisfaction of other's approbation, or of achieving symbolic immortality. Such gestures observe the resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based conventions constitutive of the human settlement. They are, in effect, if not in actual point of fact, "rationally calculated." 
This, notably, excludes charity and the PHILANTHROPIC spirit from the politics of sympathy implied by this analysis. Sorry, Bill Gates: you're within the human pale after all.

The Flashpoint of Sympathy

Of course, it is in the exceptional event that the affective politics of intensive contagion is most palpable and forceful. It is of the nature of sympathy as a qualitative force that it can act INSTANTANEOUSLY AT A DISTANCE, on the wings of a sign. It doesn't have to exert a measurable force, and it isn't inclined toward the rational calculation of starting at point A and mosying to point B in a linear and orderly fashion. The strike of the sign of passion triggers, in all immediacy, at whatever distance: it is the FLASHPOINT of an event. 

"The most distant event taking place on the other side of the world may affect my interest, and there is nothing I can do about it." More radically, the slightest sign of passion flashing at a distance may affect my vital intensity—and there is much that the self-deciding event of sympathy can do with that. 

The distance doesn't have to be geographical. It could be between conventional categories of belonging—age, class, gender, religion, species—separated from each other by a social gulf sinking gaps of remoteness into proximity. The communication of affection at the heart of the sympathetic event is by transindividual nature NONLOCAL. It can reverberate across the relational field, faster than the speed of conscious calculation. It is as double-involuntarily contagious as a sneeze or a maniacal laugh. It can skip causal intermediaries, and pop up somewhere else, in no time flat. Or, its taking-effect can be SUSPENDED, because SIGNS CAN BE ARCHIVED. This suspension is not the same as a deferral. The event is suspended in the sign's readiness potential—the semiotic equivalent of bare activity. This is not a mediation. It is an archiving of affective immediacy. The time of the affective event's taking-effect is no more linear in time than its moving-relation is in space. It is only answerable to its own rhythm, which emerges as a whole-field effect from the way in which the relational field has been primed and conditioned. The affective event is not site-specific. It is WHOLE-FIELD-RELATION-SPECIFIC. It is not pinnable to a particular place—yet it effectively TAKES PLACE. Neither is it pinpointable in clocktime—even though the emission of its triggering sign is as punctual as the chiming of a clock. Its punctuality it that of a flashpoint: an explosion, an instantaneous amplification, sending out wave upon wave of impulse, such that it MAKES AND TAKES ITS OWN TIME. The sympathetic event occurs in different dimension to metric time and space: the pulsed time of the bare-activity, churning and turning around with nonlinear readiness potential. 

The CONDITIONING of the event, although a requisite of its occurrence, is not its CAUSE. Events of complexity are not answerable to causal determinism. The complexity of the oscillatory field opens the field for chance emergences. But that is not all. The undecidability that comes of these emergent complexity-effects is compounded by the SPONTANEITY OF INTUITION: abductive thinking-feeling, making the cut, flush with the event.

As we saw earlier, abduction can lead to the invention of new action-paths. That inventivity is already at the affective core of perception's genesis, which as we saw with Hume involves the production of passions and tendencies, and from these still more of both, in a cascade of decisional cut and ongoing transition. Emergence is one thing. Invention is another. They piggy-back on each other. Together, they are doubly ontopowerful. There is no cut-and-dried distinction between them. There is, however, a difference of degree. INVENTION carries a stronger charge of passional volition. It has a momentum fueled and refueled by pulses of passion carrying the event through transitions across which its qualitative force affectively changes and qualitatively evolves. Invention is the event deciding itself to become. IT IS WHAT THE EVENT WANTS, WHEN IT WILLS ITSELF CHANGE.

Flash, 2011: a self-immolation in Tunisia ignites passionate protest. The affection skips, across a geographical distance and a suspensive interval of bare activity, to Egypt. Passionate protest reignites in Tahrir Square. From there, it reverberates across the globe. A permutation on the event pops up again half-way across the globe, riding on the wings of media signs. Occupy Wall Street takes place, making an anomalous political time for itself: a slow time of otherwise co-inhabiting public space; slow-mo explosion of potential. Next North American stop: Montreal. It is without any advance warning, a student movement amplifies into the largest student strike in Canadian history, and not stopping there, bleeds into a repotentialization of previously flagging, if not yet moribund, community-based social movements (Barney et al. 2012). There WAS NO SPECIFIC CAUSAL CONNECTION from one event in the series to the next, but there was a nonlocal linkage that was immediately, unmistakeably, thought-felt. The events were AFFECTIVELY ENTANGLED AT A DISTANCE, one becoming the trigger-sign for the next, all resonating together in their BELONGING, DIFFERENTLY in each case, to the SAME SERIES. 

The event contagion did not produce a spreading conformation. Quite the contrary, what propagated were DIFFERENCINGs. Each event along the way, in addition to being stoked by the affective strike of the signs of the passion of the other trans-ing itself in at a distance, was also infra-stoked by an event occurring immanently to a more restrained field of relation: INFRA-TRANS CO-CONDITIONING. For each new occurrence in the series, there were what Simondon calls "GERMINAL FORMS." These are affections occurring immanent to a field of relation that already has a certain consistency, including a texture of conventional belongings (for example, along national, religious, and party lines). All fields of relation textured by such resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based constituencies are riddled with internal structural tensions. The germinal affection is small event that CATAPULTS THE RELATIONAL FIELD INTO A FAR-FROM-EQUILIBRIUM OSCILLATION, exacerbating the tensions and necessitating a resolution that does conform to any of the already arrived-at solutions on offer from a particular constituencies sharing the field. The germinal affection-event catapults the relational field toward a CRITICAL POINT, where it must either fragment into a turf-fight between constituencies, or pass, as an unspecified whole of flow, over a threshold to a new consistency. The passing of the threshold occurs in DIVIDUAL-TRANSINDIVIDUAL FEEDFORWARD AND FEEDBACK. No cause can be isolated. The germinal affection-event is catalytic (given the conditions), not causally determining. The effect it produces cannot be predicted: it must be invented. 

The rallying cry is always "FREEDOM." Freedom, as we saw earlier, is not owned as right, it is not consumed as a good, it is not chosen as an option: it is what is invented. The amplification of the germinal affection-event into a crisis—a whole-field oscillation poised to cross the threshold to a new consistency—makes the field of relation INTENSELY PROBLEMATIC. It urgently re-poses the problem of freedom, requiring the invention of a new solution: A NEW MODE OF FREEDOM. The solution can only come from a FABULATORY PLAYING out of the tendencies actuated by the strike of the sign of the other's affection. In the sudden uncertainty of the field, these tendencies are of many kinds—including counter-tendencies that reenergize, or passionately invent themselves on the spot, in an instantaneous TRANSITION IN PLACE. If a counter-tendency takes the ascendance, regime-change, or even revolution, may ensue. What began as a GERMINAL MICRO-EVENT, has then amplified into THE MOST FAR-REACHING MACRO-POLITICAL CHANGE imaginable. 

When this happens, who has decided? POLITICAL MILITANTS who had long been agitating for regime-change or revolution, following their own ideological platform, are invariably caught flat-footed, and are relegated to playing catch-up. If they are successful, that is exactly what they do with the potential released: catch it, capture it. It is not they who cause the revolution. Revolutions are catalytic, complexly co-conditioned and eventfully self-deciding, in dividual-transindividual osillation. It is the programmatic actions of the militants that invariably betray the revolution—for the simple reason that, however inclusive their ideology, in the affective commotion of the event, with its overcharge of contrastive tendencies, they ultimately only amount to a constituency. They themselves soon become the vehicles for the production and defense of resemblance/familiarity/contiguity-based solidarities, effectively reestablishing boundaries and patterns of exclusion. Every revolution is betrayed. The detonative potential released runs its course and is captured and recontained, if not by its partisans, then by its opponents, and if not by its opponents, by a newly minted constituency that the event itself has invented. The minting of a new postrevolutionary constituency that betrays the force of the revolution is typically assisted by the hero-worship of the figure of the militant, now safely dead.

This is not an argument against revolution. It is a reminder that affective-events of change have a LIFE CYCLE. They rise, and they subside. They live, on a wave of surplus-value of life that they themselves produce. And they die. It is a reminder that this should be factored in from the very beginning. It is not just the onset of the event that needs to be conditioned, but also its passing. What comes germinally modulates what happens after. Anarchist-oriented movements have always, rightly, reproached Marxist and other vanguardist movements of forgetting this, in their misplaced faith that the exclusions and hierarchies of the old order will simply "wither away" with the capitalist State. The history of the twentieth-century should have taught us by now that if the germinal conditions are not tended counter to this, the exclusions and hierarchies are apt to return in what can be an even more virulent form (as was the case with the "actually existing socialism" of the centralized industrial-State capitalism of the Soviet Union). The anarchist slogan that the mode of revolutionary activity must "prefigure" the society to come is not infantile idealism. It is the affective cry of revolutionary realism.

REVOLUTIONARY REALISM is an active recognition that when affective-events of change die, they lay themselves to rest having accomplished a level of transindividuality. The transdividual contagion, to paraphrase Simondon, endows the event with a VIRTUAL IMMORTALITY. The potential released remains in reserve, as what Whitehead would call a "COMPLEX ETERNAL OBJECT": a pure potential for the mutual inclusion of a diversity of contrasts, minus the requisite conditions for its determined return (Whitehead 1978, 271). After a suspensive interval, the potential is certain to reactuate, perhaps at a far-flung taking-place, at a time-taking of the next event's making. That is: if the conditions are given, again. This transmission of the GIFT of the conditions for change should be abductively built into the movements leading up to the event. A REVOLUTION ONLY ULTIMATELY BETRAYS ITSELF IF IT PROVES LESS WORTHY AFTER ITS DEATH THAN IT WAS NECESSARY AT ITS ONSET.

Setting the conditions for the event in a way that is already a re-giving of them beyond the event is not the preserve of the militant. It is the problem of the ACTIVIST. The conditions pass through bare-activity. ONLY ACTIVITY ACTS ON ACTIVITY, just as movement only arises from movement, and affection from affection. Freedom is ACTION UPON ACTION. Activism is catalytic-sign action upon the unspecified whole of a tensional field of activities already tendentially stirring. The militant indoctrinates and inculcates; the activist modulates and induces. The militant raises consciousnesses, and brutally punishes recalcitrance; the activist seeks to catalyze what Simondon called a sympathetic "communication of subconsciousnesses" (in the present vocabulary, affective nonconsciousnesses or dividualities). The militant works in the cognitive medium of judgment; the activist tweaks in the affective mode of perceptual judgment. The militant jumps over the stopping problem to "rationally" calculated conclusions; the activist jump-starts abductions. The militant strives to replace self-interest with class interest; the activist relationally moves BEYOND INTEREST.

Some of the events events of 2011 passed the threshold to revolution, or at least regime-change, as in the case of both Tunisia and Egypt. Both transitions were betrayed, the embryonic invention of freedom aborted by recapture. The whole-field macrpolitical threshold of change was not reached in the case of Occupy Wall Street, in spite of the fact that it induced its own extensively propagating event-series of Occupies of all description. Neither was it reached in the case of the Québecois "Maple Spring" (although electoral regime-change did occur). But these movements are NO LESS "IMMORTAL" FOR THAT "FAILURE." They remain successful on the "micropolitical," or affective-event-contagion level (Massumi 2009b). The MICROPOLITICAL is no more mutually exclusive of the macropolitical than affectivity is of rationality. It is a question of co-occurring modes of activity, constituting intertwined dimensions of events. The Québec student movement  of 2011-2012, unlike Occupy Wall Street, did have a specific macropolitical objective: to block an announced tuition increase. That objective was attained when the government was forced to call an election due to the unrest, and lost. The movement, however, had a micropolitical momentum that exceeded this macropolitical aim: toward not only a tuition freeze, but past that objective for free education, and even further, for an end to the neoliberalization of the university. This momentum developed, in the case of the largest and most radical student association, into an explicitly anti-capitalist manifesto issued in the leadup to the election in an attempt to prevent the movement from slipping into wholesale recapture by representative macropolitics. It is of the NATURE OF MICROPOLITICAL AFFECTIVE-EVENT MOVEMENTS THAT DO HAVE STATED MACROPOLITICAL OBJECTIVES TO EXCEED THEM. It is this EXCESS-OVER THE MACROPOLITICAL that gives macropolitical movements their intensity, and it is in their intensity that their power lies (their ontopower). The movement did subside after the electoral win—which amounted to little more than a change in the faces fronting essentially same, fundamentally neoliberal policies, given certain strategic differences. Thus the movement died by its own success. Failure is not the only way to fail.

"Micro" is a misnomer. The concept has little to do scale, and everything to do with CROSS-SCALE SENSITIVITIES and relational contagion. All of the events of 2011-2012 were micro-political successes, in spite of their macropolitical failures, in that they released a charge of potential that continues to percolate through the relational field, IN READY RESERVE TO JUMP-CUT TO NEW TAKING-PLACES AND MAKING-TIMES, GIVEN THE CONDITIONS. They HELD A MORE-TO-LIFE, AN EXCESS OF SURPLUS-VALUE OF LIFE, IN RESERVE. They released a quantum of affective-evental "immortality." Occupy Wall Street, for example, reactuated a tendency to "DIRECT DEMOCRACY," reinvented. It invented a new collective figure of freedom: the reclaiming of the public square (not the public sphere), for directly embodied cohabitation (not mediated speech); the open assembly model of indefinitely inclusive whole-field participation; practices favoring the communicative contagion model, as in the example of the "human megaphone;" the refusal to assign a leadership subset that would fragment the relational field and reproduce familiar structures of hierarchy; the refusal of representation, in favor of immediately affecting, effective speech (performative speech, or the use of the linguistic sign as affection-event trigger); and as part of the refusal of representation, a reluctance to enumerate a platform of demands that would make the movement insertable into existing macro-political structures of conflict resolution and negotiation. This is a formidable invention, undoubtedly with many afterlives to come. And with many pre-lives, in anarchist and autonomist event-series. 

"Given the conditions": it is paramount to remember that THE CONDITIONS INCLUDE SINGULARITy. The affection-event trigger in Tunis was utterly singular, to the point that it has a proper name: Mohamed Bouazizi. Bouazizi's singular act of self-immolation was explosive by virtue of the lay of the relational land in Tunisia, implanted as it was, and as is always the case, with an ensemble of presuppositions and tendencies that are utterly unique. Every event has its own affective complexion. For Occupy Wall Street, it was a signature composition of signs, including the economic trope of the "1% percent," the couterpowerful prestige of the Anonymous brand, and the mischievously symbolic leer of the Guy Fawkes mask. The cascade of affective events occurs through a multiplier effect, not unlike the kinds of multiplier effects that neoliberalism vaunts. The difference is that COUNTERPOWER CONTAGIONS MULTIPLY THE SINGULARITY OF SERIALLY LINKED EVENTS. 

Neoliberal multiplier effects return to the same old figure of human capital: the subject of interest as enterprise-subject, caught in the paradoxes of rational choice. Neoliberalism thrives on producing new variations on the enterprise-subject. This is a remarkably multiple-singular sameness. But a sameness it is nonetheless, in the sense that all of the variations revolve around an endlessly reproduced equation between corporate entities and individual entities. The "corporations are people too" aspect of neoliberalism imposes a single model of (non)personhood that operates across scales, but only in the register of private interest. The collective level and the individual level are required to share a formal identity: that of the person as enterprise-subject. They are required, formally, to conform to that overaching model. Amid the diversity, in and through the proliferation of singularities whose emergence its far-from-equilibrium oscillatory processual fielding fosters, neoliberalism strives to hook every enterprise fish in its swell with a formal equation whose aim is to hold it all together in the capitalist orbit of the tendency to produce quantitative surplus-value. 

Counterpower contagions affirm the multiple-singular, unhooked, or hooked only on the problem of the reinvention of the freedom of events. Unhooked from the enterprise-subject, they do not impose that equation—or any other equation. They pose the DIFFERENTIAL PROBLEM of a diversity of tendencies mutually included in the same affective wave-packet, without prejudging what might issue. To the extent that they live up to their vocation of living out the full complexity of the event, they are TENDENTIALLY ANTI-CAPITALIST BY NATURE: fabulations of anticapitalist freedom; open-range becomings; becomings-feral, potentially beyond the human, let alone human-capital, pale. "Machinic" autonomies of decision. In capitalist lingo: uncalculable "externalities."

The idea that counterpowerful tendencies to capitalism stir immanent to its field, should not be confused with the "accelerationist" position often attributed (erroneously) to Deleuze and Guattari. According to the ACCELERATIONIST MODEL, the tendencies of capitalism should be pushed to the utmost extreme, in order to precipitate a crisis to end all crises. The capitalist tendency toward the production of ever greater surplus-value, through ever faster turnover, is precisely what has created the far-from-equilibrium conditions in which it operates. Push this manic tendency further, the thinking goes, and the whole, constitutively unstable, balancing act will come crashing down. The problem is that even crises from which the capitalist process is able to recover occasion endless misery. It is difficult to imagine what degree of joy might possibly rebound from the final crash. Deleuze and Guattari do not subscribe to this analysis, which ignores a distinction that is as crucial to their thought as it is to the present account: the distinction between QUALITATIVE SURPLUS-VALUE OF LIFE and quantitative capitalist surplus-value. It also ignores a second, equally crucial, distinction: between consumptive activity (revolving around hedonic satisfaction) and CREATIVE ACTIVITY (aiming for intensification). The forecast final crash would come from over-production in the name of over-consumption. These are essentially capitalist virtues, and remain so at whatever extreme they are taken to.

The tendencies immanent to the capitalist field that Deleuze and Guattari argue hold the germs of revolutionary potential are not capitalist tendencies. They may become so, through recapture, as has sadly been the case for many of the tendencies of the '60s. But in their own stirrings, in their bare-active budding, they are TENDENTIALLY ANTICAPITALIST IN the most fundamental of ways: in that they affirm the production of qualitative surplus-value of life for itself, as a value in itself (or more precisely, of the event). In a word, they are micropolitical in the sense just defined. They tend not toward self-interested satisfaction, but relationally eventful joy. They are not consumptive. Rather, they are open-endedly creative. They do not calculate rationally. 

They invent abductively. They do not strategize the next step. They fabulate a jump-cut. They are catalyzed and cascade, leaving "immortal" remainders of newly constellated potentials that "want" nothing more than to return, in an autonomy of self-decision, as the functional affective equivalent of volition. They are dividual, in cross-sensitivity with the transindividual. They are their own self-affirming and self-effecting infra-trans desire.

Capitalist society can bear many manifestations of interest, but no manifestation of desire. (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 379, translation modified).

Toward an Anticapitalist Art of the Event
  
CAPITALIST POWER, IT WAS SAID EARLIER, IS AN ONTOPOWER: a positive power of becoming, a creative power operating relationally between the oscillatory poles of the dividual and the transindividual (its own individualist rhetoric notwithstanding; or, more precisely, withstanding all too well its paradox). ONTOPOWER, IT WAS ALSO SAID, CAN ONLY BE COUNTERED BY ONTOPOWER. Further, it was asserted that this requires practicing intuition as a political art. "Art," because a counter-capitalist ontopower brings into relief the aesthetic dimension of life, defined by Whitehead as the invention of modes of compossibility among normally mutually excluding contrasts, in accordance with life's "ultimate aim" of intensification. Intuition as a political art was said to be an art of finessing the event: tweaking its conditions, in order to modulate its tendings and their issuings into determinate action, toward the collective fabulation predicated on a QUALITATIVE ALTER-ECONOMY of directly lived life-value.

This is an eminently pragmatic undertaking. It involves experimenting with PRACTICES OF EVENT-CONDITIONING. What kind of perceptual judgments produce an expanding landscape of potential? How can presuppositions be eventfully implanted in the relational field to tend it for intensification? What compositions of signs of the passion of the other are apt to induce a sympathetic event of singular-multiple contagion, beyond the human pale of self-interest? What kinds of primings lend themselves to the emergence of contrastive compossibilities? How can relations be moved in such as way as to give rise to new passions? And the new passions to new tendencies? And the new tendencies to the invention of new settlements that do not, too quickly or too harshly, relimit the potential released? How can these settlements be so constituted as to desire their own surpassing, in a next freedom-of-the-event in an ongoing series, contagiously overcoming the containments into which each event in the series inevitably subsides? How can all of this be accomplished abductively, in the immediacy of the event? How can the affective nonconscious be politically operationalized, without fostering a fascism? How do you orient the political art of intuition toward the serial reinvention of freedom? How do you learn to self-prime in this direction, in cross-sensitive collaboration with the primings at large in the relational field, given the limits of reflective reason? In short, how do you MACHINE TRANSINDIVIDUAL AUTONOMIES OF DECISION, given their … autonomy? And in a way as resistant as possible to capitalist recapture?

There is only one answer to these questions: there is no general answer to them. The purpose of raising them is not to prefigure a solution, but rather to point to the need for a proliferation of practices aimed at developing TECHNIQUES OF RELATION that answer to this problematic delineated by the unanswerability-in-general of such questions. Although unanswerable in general, the problem is singularly stageable. It is eminently possible to set in place conditions that reactivate the problematic field these questions gesture toward. When that is done, with sufficient art—with sufficient technique leavened with a healthy dose of relational intuition—an affective event may well be occasioned. There is no way around a trial-and-error approach. Each event is the affective germ of a series of events that belong to each other, at a distance and across suspensive intervals. Practices of the political art of the event are experimental practices that want nothing so much as cascading company, commotionally taking-place as they serially make their own time.

The events need not be dramatic. And they need not wait for an exceptional conjuncture of catalytic conditions. Ordinary events can release potential, in their own intensely modest way. They can seriate, in the tensional gaps of the texture of the everyday. Micropolitical events ostensibly occurring on a small-scale always have the potential to ignite, and amplify. It happens when least expected. In any case, militating for revolution also only ever works when it is least expected—on the back of a self-deciding event-contagion whose trigger-conditions are by nature beyond militantism's consciousness-raising ken. And when it does succeed on its own steam, it is because it is capable of causal forcing—and thus already carries the germs of its own betrayal in its programmatically calculating macro-political genes.

So: no need to wait for the "right" conditions. There are no right conditions. There are only singular conditions. Experimentally tweak them. Emit signs of passion. Catalyze whatever events lie in your dividual-transindividual reach. Make joy. Take joy in what qualitiative surplus-values of life are potentially ready for the living where you are. Make a micropolitical commotion, and nudge it toward abductive action. Surrender yourself artfully, in a relation to others that is your self-relation to the future, in an activism of the event.


SUPPLEMENT I

THE AFFECTIVE TASKS OF REASON


After holding rationality's invisible fingers to the flame for so many pages, it is time to give it its due. Reason, there is no denying, has a crucial role to play—provided it reins in its own hybris and takes Hume's word for it that it has no motive force ("reason alone can never produce any action, or give rise to volition"; Hume 1984, 3.1.3, 460). By Hume's reckoning, reason plays two roles.

The first task is critique, understood in the very specific sense of the identification of errors of perceptual judgment. These can be thought of as objective illusions: incongruities effectively built into the relational conditions of an occasion of perception that embed a defect into its genesis. Whitehead's favorite example is taking an object in a mirror to lie behind it. Objective illusions are not simple glitches. They are the positive product of life's entropic tendency to the conformation of feelings: habitual presuppositions (for example, the regularities of perspective) that feed forward into a new situation because the usual cues are in force, while counter-cues that something is amiss, although they are also present, fail to take effect. Objective illusions are a conditioned failure to register the full singularity of the situation. They result in the newly arising occasion being likened, in its essential traits, to previously known situations. The new situation is erroneously experienced as being more similar to a class of other events, than it is different in its own occurrence. In its critical role, reason can exercise its historically acquired taste for foundations or grounds by returning perceptual judgment to its grounding in singularity, in cases where it strays too far toward the perceptual pole of the conformation of feelings. This task requires reason to overcome its also historically acquired, and perhaps even more strongly engrained, passion for generality, and the classificatory logic that sustains it. Thus reason must  concurrently conduct a self-critique of its love of the general idea. An objective illusion is precisely the form in which general ideas are effectively found in the world. Traditionally, "rationality" has aggrandized them—amplified them— rather than regrounding them in the singularity from which they come. The "subject" is the most widespread and processually significant of these rationally-aggrandized objective illusions.

The second task that Hume allows reason is corrective: to evaluate the efficacity of a means a tendency has decided upon to further itself along its chosen orientation, toward its desired terminus. This task allows reason to indulge in another of its loves: the passion for causality. "Rationality" traditionally favors explanation through the identification of local, antecedent causes, whose linear effects are proportional to the transmitted impetus. This is perfectly adequate to relatively closed, simple systems, on certain levels of reality (those answering to the classical laws of thermodynamics). Under conditions of complexity, many forms of rationality have upped their game to include structural or formal causes. This gives up on the locality of an isolatable cause, but retains a certain linearity of effect: for example, transitions between ages, epochs, or paradigms. Still further down the road toward complexity, systems theory and complexity theory itself have had to rationally recognize the reality of recursive causality: feedback. Once feedback is allowed, there is a boomerang effect that crushes any illusions that might have remained that linear cause-effect relations are generally salvageable: feedfoward. 

Feedforward rebounds on the very concept of tendency. Tendency is a passionate orientation governing movement toward an attractor, or desired terminus (using "desire" in the subjectless sense developed in this essay of an autonomy of decision affirming its own affective motive force). The emergent, nonlinear complexity-effects of feedback-feedforward operating together can alter or even reinvent the terminus. This is what it means to invent a tendency. Given the natural disposition of the world to becoming, this reinvention of tendential termini is more often the case than not. The terminus, as William James observed, "ninety-times out of a hundred" remains "virtual" (James 1996, 69, 71-72). It is not a "the" terminus: it is a singularly multiple constellation of superposed, potential terminal states, together in contrast, and under constant reformatting. There is only one thing a tendency, as an affective volition, wants more than to reach its terminus, and that is to continue—to affirm its reality as a tending-toward (as opposed to an arrival, which is a very different animal). Tending-toward is constitutively open-ended, by nature implicated in movements of invention. 

Reason's means-testing task is therefore much more complicated than it might seem at first. Rationality cannot presume to be capable of handling this corrective role in isolation, because what needs its evaluations are tendencies, whose open-ended emergent complexity is precisely the kind of thing that is beyond rationality's ken. The first thing reason needs to do to make itself worthy of this task is to conduct another self-critique, this time of its passion for causality. Like reason's love for generality, its attachment to causality is a glorification of habit: a product of the engrained expectation of a certain result based on the regularity with which like results were experienced in past occasions perceived to be of a similar kind.46 Rationality's overwrought attachment to traditional models of causality is thus another result of the objective illusion that consists in unperceiving the singularity of situations, specifically as regards the self-relation to their own future of the tendencies presently running through the situation's perceived configuration. The two self-critiques of reason must be intimately coupled. Together, they must disabuse reason of its instinctive distrust toward affectivity and intuition.

Thus disabused, reason can proceed to its second task. In order to succeed at its corrective task, reason must enter into the closest of cooperation with abductive experience. It must processually embrace what its hybris too often leads it to regard as its "irrational" opposite. It must become a fellow-traveller of the kinds of relational experimentations described at the end of the main essay above. It must lovingly accompany them, recognizing that the "means" it can test, and help construct, are techniques of relation: experimental setups for producing felicitous conditions for the inventive exercise of abduction, in the infra-transindividual mode in which it natively operates.

When reason abandons its hybristic belief in its power to be a motive force, and its overweened sense of its own grandiosity, when it surrenders itself to co-operation with affectivity, it actually gains something it can never attain by itself: creativity. The fact that reading and multi-step mathematical operations can occur nonconsciously means that highly elaborated, rational techniques can feedback-feedforward into the germinal level of experience, to operate flush with perception's genesis. Consciously elaborated means of action can become nonconscious, as part of a process whereby practice becomes perception. The results of cognition and rational cogitation go down the rabbit-hole that is the regressive endpoint of life, turning around from which life arises anew. There, rationality enters through its own results into superposition with the other modes of activity churning there, including of course those which give rise to perceptual judgments and abductions. Rationality actively enters into mutual inclusion with affectivity—effectively enfolding into the affective wave-packet. As enveloped in bare activity, reason becomes ontopowerful. By association, at least: in co-operation. It becomes a contributory co-operative factor of becoming. 

At this point, rationality has lost all pretense of passing final judgment, alone from on high. It loses its grim enjoyment for imposing "correctness": for normalizing situations through the imposition of general ideas, and disciplining processes by in the name of causality. It has found joy. It has lost its prescriptive vocation, and thrown its lot in with intuition. It has agreed to be in the service of spontaneity.

In the phrase "practice becomes perception," emphasis should be retained on the word "practice." A "corrective" function is not one that imposes a "correctness" on an activity from without. A corrective works immanently to a process to tweak it along from within. The mode of the corrective is not judgment, but trial and error: in other words, the iterative re-staging of event-conditions which progressively explore the reserve of potential in an event, as part of a continuing series of events, affectively interlinked at a distance. Trial-and-error assumes no posture of correctness. It enters the event-contagious stream with tweak-effective technique. Technique is applied to the catalytic conditions of the relational field whose characteristics are repeated and varied across the stream of the punctual events composing a series. A corrective contributes to steering the stream. If you want a metaphor for reason's mode of activity in its becoming-creative, it would be more nautical than juridical. Reason, in co-operation with intuition, is not a judge. It is more like a rudder.

All of this depends on rationality accepting the humbling fact that it does not have to be opposed to passion, and enter into heroic combat with affectivity. It has to distance itself from its own history. In experiencing the joy of ontopowerful invention, rationality will come to accept the fact that it is itself a passion after all. Just one of a contrary humor historically, overly enamored of its own hybris, and strangely overestimating of its own tendential force. When reason reconciles itself to its own passion, it can finally tend to the relational future of creative co-operation. This entails admitting that its love for generality and causality were always already passions—albeit of a limitative calling, acting to curtail more inventive and expansive passions, thus figuring as passionate factors of anti-becoming. Reason must admit its own passionate nature, in order to convert itself from its limitative exercse into a force for becoming, in an immanent self-overcoming internal to its own critical/corrective exercise. Now reason is in a position to return the favor affectivity has always done it, in allowing structures of rationality to live off the capture of its positive force for invention without so much as a thanks.

As a passion, the becoming-creative of reason is liable to conversion into emotion, as is the case for all affect. As oriented to the relational future, reason is in processual embrace with the process of sympathy. The emotions into which it is most helpful for its passion to convert, in pursuit of its second affective task, are concern and generosity: care for the relational event. But this should not be allowed to obscure the ontopowerful fact that these emotions are essentially personalized expressions of the potential for the relational event. At bare-active bottom, at the inmost endpoint rearising of life, they are nonpersonal virtues of the event. (Manning and Massumi, 2014).

Mission: affectively-rationally live the generosity of the event. 
Tend it, and enjoy.

KEYWORDS FOR AFFECT




Threshold

The concept of affect as mobilized here is adapted from Spinoza, via Deleuze. Spinoza speaks of the body in terms of its capacity for affecting or being affected. These are not two different capacities—they always go together. When you affect something, you are opening yourself up to being affected in turn, and in a slightly different way than you might have been the moment before. You have made a transition, however slight. You have stepped over a threshold. Affect is this passing of a threshold, seen from the point of view of the change in capacity. 

Body

It is crucial to remember that when Spinoza talks about affect he is talking about the body. What a body is, he says, is what it can do as it goes along. This is a totally pragmatic definition. A body is defined by what capacities it carries from step to step. What these are exactly is changing constantly. A body’s ability to affect or be affected—its charge of affect or power of existence—isn’t something fixed. Depending on the circumstances, it goes up and down gently like a tide, or maybe storms and crests like a wave, or at times simply bottoms out.

Tendency - Intensity

For Spinoza, the body is one with its transitions. There is no "the" body. There is a continuous bodying. Each transition is accompanied by a variation in capacity: a change in which powers to affect and be affected are addressable by a next event and how readily addressable they are, or to what degree they are present as futurities. That "degree" is a bodily intensity, and its present futurity is a tendency. The Spinozist problematic of affect offers a way of weaving together concepts of movement, tendency, and intensity, in becoming

Qualities of Life 

The feeling of the transition as the body moves from one affect, or power of existence, to another has a certain separability from the event it is bound up with, in that the transition itself is distinct from the capacitation activating the passage. What is felt is the quality of the experience. The account of affect will then have to directly address forms of experience, forms of life, on a qualitative register. 

Affective Return

The felt transition leaves a trace, it constitutes a memory. Consequently, it can’t be restricted to that one occurrence. Its quality of experience is bound to return. It has already returned, in some capacity. It was already part of a series of repetitions, to the extent that the body has a past.

Event

The affective capacitation of bodying as it’s gearing up for a passage towards a diminished or augmented state is completely bound up with the lived past of the body. That past includes what we think of as subjective elements, such as habits, acquired skills, inclinations, desires, even willings, all of which come in patterns of repetition. This doesn’t make the event any less rooted in the body. The past that the body carries forward in serial fashion includes levels we think of as physical and biological, such as genetic inheritance and phylogenesis. There is a reactivation of the past in passage toward a changed future, cutting across dimensions of time, between past and future, and between pasts of different orders. This in-between time or transversal time is the time of the event. This temporality enables, and requires you, to rethink all of these terms—bodily capacitation, felt transition, quality of lived experience, memory, repetition, seriation, tendency—in dynamic relation to each other.

Potential/Virtual – Freedom/Intensity

There’s a population or swarm of potential ways of affecting or being affected that follows along as we move through life. We always have a vague sense that they’re there. That vague sense of potential, we call it our freedom, and defend it fiercely. But no matter how certainly we know that the potential is there, it always seems just out of reach, or maybe around the next bend. Because it isn’t actually there—only virtually. But maybe if we can take little, practical, experimental, strategic measures to expand our emotional register, or limber up our thinking, we can access more of our potential at each step, have more of it actually available. Having more potentials available intensifies our life. We’re less enslaved by our situations. Even if we never have our freedom, we’re always experiencing a degree of freedom: wriggle room. Our degree of freedom at any one time corresponds to how much of our experiential ‘depth’ we can access toward a next step—how intensely we are living and moving. Its horizon varies at each transition, and new degrees of freedom can emerge. It’s all about the openness of situations and how we can live that openness. And you have to remember that the way we live it is always entirely embodied, and that is never entirely personal—it’s never all contained in our emotions and conscious thoughts.

Redoubling - Emotion

Because affect concerns the movements of the body it can’t be reduced to emotion.  It is not subjective in the sense of belonging to a subject to which the body belongs. Which is not to say that there is nothing subjective about it. Spinoza says that every transition is accompanied by a feeling of the change in capacity. The affect and the feeling of the transition are not two different things. They’re two sides of the same coin, just like affecting and being affected. This is one sense in which affect is about intensity—every affect is a doubling. The experience of a change, an affecting-being affected, is redoubled by an experience of the experience. The two together give each event a unique subjective form. It gives the body’s movements a kind of intensive depth that stays with it across all its transitions, accumulating—in memory, in habit, in reflex, in desire, in tendency. Emotion is the way the intensive depth of that ongoing experience registers personally at a given moment. It is only on the level of emotion that this subjective form of the affective event comes to be experienced as belonging to a subject separate from the event.

Containment

An emotion is a subjective content, the socio-linguistic fixing of the quality of an experience which is from that point onward defined as personal. Emotion is qualified intensity, the conventional, consensual point of insertion of intensity into semantically and semiotically formed progressions, into narrativizable action-reaction circuits, into function and meaning. It is intensity owned and recognized. It is crucial to theorize the difference between affect and emotion.

The Autonomy of Affect - Escape

Affect is autonomous to the degree to which it escapes confinement in the particular body whose vitality, or potential for interaction, it is. Formed, qualified, situated perceptions and cognitions fulfilling functions of actual connection or blockage, are the capture and closure of affect. Emotion is the intensest (most contracted) expression of that capture—and of the fact that something has always and again escaped. Something remains unactualized, inseparable from but unassimilable to any particular emotional expression. That is why all emotion is more or less disorienting, and why it is classically described as being outside of oneself, at the very point at which one is in most intimately and unshareably in contact with oneself and one’s vitality. If there were no escape, no excess or remainder, the universe would be without potential, pure entropy, death. Structures, of all kinds, emotional and otherwise, live in and through that which escapes them. Their autonomy is the autonomy of affect. The autonomy of affect is its participation in the virtual: potential remaindered by the past, left in reserve for the future. Its autonomy is its openness. Its openness is to the escape-hatch of its own futurity.

Perception of Perception – Vitality Affect

The escape of affect cannot but be perceived, alongside the perceptions that are its capture. This side-perception may be punctual, localized in an event (such as the sudden realization that happiness and sadness are something besides what they are). When it is punctual, it is usually described in negative terms, typically as a form of shock (the sudden interruption of of functions of actual connection). But it is also continuous, like a background perception that accompanies every event, however quotidian. When the continuity of affective escape is put into words, it tends to take on positive connotations. For it is nothing less than the perception of one’s own vitality, one’s sense of aliveness, of changeability (often signified  as “freedom”). One’s “sense of aliveness” is a continuous, nonconscious self-perception (unconscious self-reflection or lived self-referentiality).  It is the perception of this self-perception, its naming and making conscious, that allows affect to be effectively analyzed.

Remainder - Excess

You can think of affect in the broadest sense as what remains of life potential after each or every thing a body says or does—as a perpetual bodily remainder. Looked at from a different angle, this perpetual remainder is an excess. It's like a reserve of potential or newness or creativity that is experienced alongside every actual production of meaning in language or in any performance of a useful function—vaguely but directly experienced, as something more, a more to come—a life overspilling as it gathers itself up to move on.

Shock – Cut/Flow

Affect is about shock, but doesn’t have to be a drama. It’s really more about micro-shocks, the kind that populate every moment of our lives. For example a change in focus, or a rustle at the periphery of vision that draws the gaze toward it. In every shift of attention, there is an interruption, a momentary cut in the mode of onward deployment of life. The cut can pass unnoticed, striking imperceptibly, like a prime, with only its effects entering conscious awareness as they unroll. This is the onset of the activation that marks a coming transition. This onset of experience is by nature imperceptible. 

Microperception

This is one way of understanding “microperception,” a concept of great importance to Deleuze and Guattari. Microperception is not smaller perception, it’s a perception of a qualitatively different kind. It’s something that is felt without registering consciously. It registers only in its effects. According to this notion of shock, there is always a commotion under way, a “something doing” as James would say. There is always a something-doing cutting in, interrupting whatever continuities are in progress. For things to continue, they have to re-continue. They have to re-jig around the interruption, toward a new transition. At the instant of re-jigging, the body braces for what will come. It in-braces, in the sense that it returns to its potential for more of life to come, and that potential is immanent to its own arising. 

Worlding

You can sometimes feel the in-bracing itself, most noticeably in startles or frights. Before you can even consciously recognize what you’re afraid of, or even feel that it is yourself that is the subject of the feeling, you are catapulted into a feeling of the frightfulness of the situation. It only dawns on you in the next instant that you’d better figure out what might have done the catapulting, and what you should do about it. It is only then that you own the feeling as your own, and recognize it as a content of your life, an episode in your personal history. But in the instant of the affective hit, there is no content yet. All there is is the affective quality, coinciding with the feeling of the interruption, and of the coming transition. That affective quality is all there is to the world in that instant. It takes over life, fills the world, for an immeasurable instant of shock. Microperception is this purely affective rebeginning of the world.

Bare Activity – Suspense – Nonconscious

The world in which we live is literally made of these reinaugural microperceptions, cutting in, cueing emergence, priming capacities. Every body is at every instant in thrall to any number of them. A body is a complex of in-bracings playing out complexly and in serial fashion. The tendencies and capacities activated do not necessarily bear fruit. Some will be summoned to the verge of unfolding, only to be left behind, unactualized. But even these will have left their trace. In that moment of interruptive commotion, there’s a productive indecision. There’s a constructive suspense that I call bare activity. Potentials resonate and interfere, and this modulates what actually eventuates. The concept of affect is tied to the idea of modulation occurring at a constitutive level where many somethings are doing, most of them unfelt. Or again, felt only in effect. No less real for passing unfelt.

Affective Politics

Politics, approached affectively, is an art of emitting the interruptive signs, triggering the cues, that attune bodies while activating their capacities differentially. Affective politics is inductive. Bodies can be inducted into, or attuned to, certain regions of tendency, futurity, and potential, they can be induced into inhabiting the same affective environment, even if there is no assurance they will act alike in that environment. A good example is an alarm, a sign of threat or danger. Even if you conclude in the next instant that it’s a false alarm, you will have come to that conclusion in an environment that is still effectively one of threat. Others who have heard the alarm may well respond differently, but they will be responding differently together, as inhabitants of the same affective environment. Everyone registering the alarm will have been attuned to the same threat event, in one way or another. It is the sum total of the different ways of being interpellated by the same event that will define what it will have been politically. The event can’t be fully predetermined. It will be as it happens. For there to be uniformity of response, other factors must have been active to pre-channel tendencies. Politics of conformity pivoting on the signalling of threat, like the politics that held sway during the Bush administration, must work on many levels and at many rhythms of bodily priming to ensure a relative success. And again, there will be minor lines that won’t be emphasized or come out into relief or be fully enacted but that everyone will have felt in that unfeeling way of negatively prehending. Those are left as a reservoir of political potential. It is a potential that is immediately collective. It’s not a mere possibility, it’s an active part of the constitution of that situation, it’s just one that hasn’t been fully developed, that hasn’t been fully capacitated for unfolding. This means that there are potential alter-politics at the collectively in-braced heart of every situation, even the most successfully conformist in its mode of attunement. You can return to that reservoir of real but unexpressed potential, and re-cue it. This would be a politics of micro-perception: a micropolitics. The Obama campaign’s recueing of fear toward hope might be seen as targeting that micropolitical level, interestingly, through macro-media means.
	
Affective Attunement

Say there are a number of bodies indexed to the same cut, primed to the same cue, shocked in concert. What happens is a collective event. It’s distributed across those bodies. Since each body will carry a different set of tendencies and capacities, there is no guarantee that they will act in unison even if they are cued in concert. However different their eventual actions, all will have unfolded from the same suspense. They will have been attuned—differentially—to the same interruptive commotion. “Affective attunement”—a concept from Daniel Stern—is a crucial piece to the affective puzzle. It is a way of approaching affective politics that is much more supple than notions more present in the literature of what’s being called the “affective turn,” like imitation or contagion, because it finds difference in unison, and concertation in difference. Because of that, it can better reflect the complexity of collective situations, as well as the variability that can eventuate from what might be considered the “same” affect. There is no sameness of affect. There is affective difference in the same event—a collective individuation.
	
Subject/Object – World

Calling affect, or that felt moment of bodily moving on, intersubjective is misleading, if intersubjective is taken to mean that we start from a world in which there are already subjects that are preconstituted, or a pregiven structure of subject positions ready for subjects to come occupy. What is in question is precisely the emergence of the subject, its primary constitution, or its reemergence and reconstitution. The subject of an experience emerges from a field of conditions which are not that subject yet, where it is just coming into itself. Those conditions are not yet necessarily even subjective in any normal sense. Before the subject, there’s an in-mixing, a field of budding relation too crowded and heterogeneous to call intersubjective. It’s not at a level where things have settled into categories like subject and object. It’s the level of what William James called pure experience. When I say that it all comes back to the body, I don’t mean the body as a thing apart from the self or subject. I mean that the body is that region of in-mixing from which subjectivity emerges. It is the coming together of the world, for experience, in a here-and-now prior to any possibility of assigning categories like subject or object. That affective region we were talking about is not in-between in the intersubjective sense. And it’s not intentional in the sense of already carrying a subject-object polarity. It’s a brewing, the world stirring. It’s a coming event, through which such categories will return.

Belonging

In affect, we are never alone. That’s because affects in Spinoza’s definition are basically ways of  connecting, to others and to other situations, affecting and being affected. They are our angle of participation in processes larger than ourselves. With intensified affect comes a stronger sense of embeddedness in a larger field of life—a heightened sense of belonging, with other people and to other places.

Aesthetic Politics 

I think that advocating affective politics is advocating aesthetic politics. I think about the connection between affective politics and aesthetic politics in terms of Whitehead’s idea of “contrast.” Contrasts are tendential unfoldings that are held together in the same situation. They are alternate headings that come together in the instant, even though their actual unfoldings are mutually exclusive. Their mutual exclusiveness is a kind of creative tension: an intensity. The  contrasts between headings interfere and resonate, and this commotion modulates what may come. Whitehead defines the aesthetic in terms of this intensity of contrasts. The aesthetic act extends the creative tension of contrast that characterizes the emergence of every action. It prolongs the suspension of the cut, the commotion of interference and resonance, gives it duration, so that it passes the threshold of perceptibility and is consciously felt as potential. This prevents the heading from being an automatic feedforward to the end, like a reflex response to a stimulus. Resolution is suspended. The termini in play remain virtual ends. Their mutual exclusivity is still informing the situation, contributing to what it might be, but the tension doesn’t have to resolve itself to be consciously felt and thought. Aesthetic politics is irresolute. It is commotional. It’s the thinking-feeling of the virtual incompletion of definitive action. 

Affective Alter-Politics

This might not sound political, at least in the way we usually understand the political. But it is, because the virtuality is of an event to come, and as we saw before the event always has the potential to affectively attune a multiplicity of bodies to its happening, differentially. Aesthetic politics brings the collectivity of shared events to the fore, as differential,: a multiple, bodily potential for what might come. Difference is built into this account. Affective politics, understood as aesthetic politics, is dissensual, in the sense that it holds contrasting alternatives together without immediately demanding that one alternative eventuate and the others evaporate. It makes thought-felt different capacities for existence, different life potentials, different forms of life, without immediately imposing either a choice—or compromise—between them. 

Ecology of Practices

The political question, then, is not how to find a resolution. It’s not how to impose a solution. It’s how to keep the intensity in what comes next. The only way is through actual differentiation. Different lines of unfolding bring the contrast into actuality, between them. The political question is then what Isabelle Stengers calls an “ecology of practices.” How do you tend this proliferation of differentiation? How can the lines not clash and destroy each other? How do they live together? The “solution” is not to resolve the tension through a choice, or find a general compromise, but to modulate the tension into a complex symbiosis. A cross-fertilization of capacitations that live out, to the fullest, the intensity of the event of their coming together.



1. THE AUTONOMY OF AFFECT



I. 

A man builds a snowman on his roof garden. It starts to melt in the afternoon sun. He watches. After a time, he takes the snowman to the cool of the mountains, where it stops melting. He bids it good-bye, and leaves.

Just images, no words, very simple. It was a story depicted in a short shown on German TV as a fill-in between programs. The film drew complaints from parents reporting that their children had been frightened. That drew the attention of a team of researchers. Their study was notable for failing to find much of what it was studying: cognition.

Researchers, headed by Hertha Sturm, used three versions of the film: the original wordless version and two versions with voice-overs added. The first voice-over version was dubbed “factual.” It added a simple step-by-step account of the action as it happened. A second version was called “emotional.” It was largely the same as the “factual” version, but included at crucial turning points words expressing the emotional tenor of the scene under way.

Sets of nine-year old children were tested for recall, and asked to rate the version they saw on a scale of “pleasantness.” The factual version was consistently rated the least pleasant, and was also the worst remembered. The  most pleasant was the original wordless version, which was rated just slightly above the emotional. And it was the emotional version that was best remembered.

This is already a bit muddling. Something stranger happened when the subjects of the study were asked to rate the individual scenes in the film simultaneously on a “happy-sad” scale and a “pleasant-unpleasant” scale. The “sad” scenes were rated the most pleasant, the sadder the better.

The hypothesis that immediately suggests itself is that in some kind of precocious anti-Freudian protest, the children were equating arousal with pleasure. But this being an empirical study, the children were wired. Their physiological reactions were monitored. The factual version elicited the highest level of arousal, even though it was the most unpleasant (i.e., happy) and made the least long-lasting impression. The children, it turns out, were physiologically split: factuality made their heart beat faster and deepened their breathing; but it made their skin resistance fall. The original nonverbal version elicited the greatest response from their skin. Galvanic skin response measures autonomic reaction.

From the tone of their report, it seems that the researchers were a bit taken aback by their results. They contented themselves with observing that the difference between sadness and happiness is not all that it’s cracked up to be, and worrying that the difference between children and adults was also not all that it was cracked up to be (judging by studies of adult retention of newsbroadcasts). Their only positive conclusion was the primacy of the affective in image reception.i
Accepting and expanding upon that, it could be noted that the primacy of the affective is marked by a gap between content and effect: it would appear that the strength or duration of an image’s effect is not logically connected to the content in any straightforward way. This is not to say that there is no connection and no logic. What is meant here by the content of the image is its indexing to conventional meanings in an intersubjective context, its socio-linguistic qualification. This indexing fixes the determinate qualities of the image; the strength or duration of the image’s effect could be called its intensity. What comes out here is that there is no correspondence or conformity between qualities and intensity. If there is a relation, it is of another nature.

To translate this negative observation into a positive one: the event of image reception is multi-leveled, or at least bi-level. There is an immediate bifurcation in response into two systems. One, the level of intensity, is characterized by a crossing of semantic wires: on it, sadness is pleasant. The level of intensity is organized according to a logic that does not admit of the excluded middle. This is to say that it is not semantically or semiotically ordered. It does not fix distinctions. Instead, it vaguely but insistently connects what is normally indexed as separate. When asked to signify itself, it can only do so in a paradox. There is disconnection of signifying order from intensity – which constitutes a different order of connection operating in parallel. The gap noted earlier is not only between content and effect. It is also between the form of content – signification as a conventional system of distinctive difference – and intensity. The disconnection between form/content and intensity/effect is not just negative: it enables a different connectivity, a different difference, in parallel.

Both levels, qualification and intensity, are immediately embodied. Intensity is embodied in purely autonomic reactions most directly manifested in the skin – at the surface of the body, at its interface with things. Depth reactions belong more to the form/content (qualification) level, even though they also involve autonomic functions such as heartbeat and breathing. The reason may be that they are associated with expectation, which depends on consciously positioning oneself in a line of narrative continuity.  Modulations of heartbeat and breathing mark a reflux of consciousness into the autonomic depths, coterminous with a rise of the autonomic into consciousness. They are a conscious-autonomic mix, a measure of their participation in one another. Intensity is beside that loop, a nonconscious, never-to-be-conscious autonomic remainder. It is outside expectation and adaptation, as disconnected from meaningful sequencing, from narration, as it is from vital function. It is narratively de-localized, spreading over the generalized body surface, like a lateral backwash from the function-meaning interloops traveling the vertical path between head and heart.

Language, though head-strong, is not simply in opposition to intensity. It would seem to function differentially in relation to it. The factual version of the snowman story was dampening. Matter-of-factness dampens intensity. In this case, matter-of-factness was a doubling of the sequence of images with a narration expressing in as objective a manner as possible the common-sense function and consensual meaning of the movements perceived on screen. This interfered with the images’ effect. The emotional version added a few phrases that punctuated the narrative line with qualifications of the emotional content, as opposed to the objective-narrative content. The qualifications of emotional content enhanced the images’ effect, as if they resonated with the level of intensity rather than interfering with it. An emotional qualification breaks narrative continuity for a moment to register a state – actually re-register an already felt state (for the skin is faster than the word). 

The relationship between the levels of intensity and qualification is not one of conformity or correspondence, but of resonation or interference, amplification or dampening. Linguistic expression can resonate with and amplify intensity at the price of of making itself functionally redundant. When on the other hand it doubles a sequence of movements in order to add something to it in the way of meaningful progression – in this case a sense of futurity, expectation, an intimation of what comes next in a conventional progression – then it runs counter to and dampens the intensity. Intensity would seem to be associated with nonlinear processes: resonation and feedback which momentarily suspend the linear progress of the narrative present from past to future. Intensity is qualifiable as an emotional state, and that state is static – temporal and narrative noise. It is a state of suspense, potentially of disruption. It’s like a temporal sink, a hole in time, as we conceive of it and narrativize it. It is not exactly passivity, because it is filled with motion, vibratory motion, resonation. And it is not yet activity, because the motion is not of the kind that can be directed (if only symbolically) toward practical ends in a world of constituted objects and aims (if only on screen). Of course the qualification of an emotion is quite often, in other contexts, itself a narrative element that moves the action ahead, taking its place in socially recognized lines of action and reaction. But to the extent that it is, it is not in resonance with intensity. It resonates to the exact degree to which it is in excess of any narrative or functional line.

In any case, language doubles the flow of images, on another level, on a different track. There is a redundancy of resonation that plays up or amplifies (feeds back disconnection, enabling a different connectivity), and a redundancy of signification that plays out or linearizes (jumps the feedback loop between vital function and meaning into lines of socially valorized action and reaction). Language belongs to entirely different orders depending on which redundancy it enacts. Or, it always enacts both more or less completely: two languages, two dimensions of every expression, one superlinear, the other linear. Every event takes place on both levels – and between both levels, as they resonate together to form a larger system composed of two interacting subsystems following entirely different rules of formation. For clarity, it might be best to give different names to the two halves of the event. In this case: suspense could be distinguished from and interlinked with expectation, as superlinear and linear dimensions of the same image-event, which is at the same time an expression-event.

Approaches to the image in its relation to language are incomplete if they operate only on the semantic or semiotic level, however that level is defined (linguisitically, logically, narratologically, ideologically, or all of these in combination, as a Symbolic). What they lose, precisely, is the expression event – in favor of structure. Much could be gained by integrating the dimension of intensity into cultural theory. The stakes are the new. For structure is the place where nothing ever happens, that explanatory heaven in which all eventual permutations are prefigured in a self-consistent set of invariant generative rules. Nothing is prefigured in the event. It is the collapse of structured distinction into intensity, of rules into paradox. It is the suspension of the invariance that makes happy happy, sad sad, function function, and meaning mean. Could it be that it is through the expectant suspension of that suspense that the new emerges? As if an echo of irreducible excess, of gratuitous amplification, piggy-backed on the reconnection to progression, bringing a tinge of the unexpected, the lateral, the unmotivated, to lines of action and reaction. A change in the rules. The expression-event is the system of the inexplicable: emergence, into and against (re)generation and (the re-production of a structure). In the case of the snowman, the unexpected and inexplicable that emerged along with the generated responses had to do with the differences between happiness and sadness, children and adults, not being all they’re cracked up to be, much to our scientific chagrin: a change in the rules. Intensity is the unassimilable.

For present purposes, intensity will be equated with affect. There seems to be a growing feeling within media, literary and art theory that affect is central to an understanding of our information and image-based late-capitalist culture, in which so-called master narratives are perceived to have foundered. Fredric Jameson notwithstanding, belief has waned for many, but not affect. If anything, our condition is characterized by a surfeit of it. The problem is that there is no cultural-theoretical vocabulary specific to affect.ii Our entire vocabulary has derived from theories of signification that are still wedded to structure even across irreconciliable differences (the divorce proceedings of poststructuralism: terminable or interminable?). In the absence of an asignifying philosophy of affect, it is all too easy for received psychological categories to slip back in, undoing the considerable deconstructive work that has been effectively carried out by poststructuralism. Affect is most often used loosely as a synonym for emotion.iii But one of the clearest lessons of this first story is that emotion and affect – if affect is intensity – follow different logics and pertain to different orders. 

An emotion is a subjective content, the socio-linguistic fixing of the quality of an experience which is from that point onward defined as personal. Emotion is qualified intensity, the conventional, consensual point of insertion of intensity into semantically and semiotically formed progressions, into narrativizable action-reaction circuits, into function and meaning. It is intensity owned and recognized. It is crucial to theorize the difference between affect and emotion. If some have the impression that affect has waned, it is because affect is unqualified. As such, it is not ownable or recognizable, and is thus resistent to critique.

It is not that there is no philosophical antecedents to draw on. It is just that they are not the usual ones for literary and cultural studies. On many of these points there is a formidable philosophical precursor: on the difference in nature between affect and emotion; on the irreducibly bodily and autonomic nature of affect; on affect as a suspension of action-reaction circuits and linear temporality in a sink of what might be called “passion,” to distinguish it both from passivity and activity; on the equation between affect and effect; on the form/content of conventional discourse as constituting a separate stratum running counter to the full registering of affect and its affirmation, its positive development, its expression as and for itself – on all of these points, it is the name of Baruch Spinoza that stands out. The title of his central work suggests a designation for the project of thinking affect: Ethics.iv

Another story, about the brain: the mystery of the missing half-second.

Experiments were performed on patients who had been implanted with cortical electrodes for medical purposes. Mild electrical pulses were administered to the electrode and also to points on the skin. In either case, the stimulation was felt only if it lasted more than half a second: half a second, the minimum perceivable lapse. If the cortical electrode was fired a half second before the skin was stimulated, patients reported feeling the skin pulse first. The researcher speculated that sensation involves a “backward referral in time” – in other words, that sensation is organized recursively before being linearized, before it is redirected outwardly to take its part in a conscious chain of actions and reactions. Brain and skin form a resonating vessel. Stimulation turns inward, is folded into the body, except that there is no inside for it to be in, because the body is radically open, absorbing impulses quicker than they can be perceived, and because the entire vibratory event is unconscious, out of mind. Its anomaly is smoothed over retrospectively to fit conscious requirements of continuity and linear causality.

What happens during the missing half second? A second experiment gave some hints.
Brain waves of healthy volunteers were monitored by an electroencephograph (EEG) machine. The subjects were asked to flex a finger at a moment of their choosing, and to note the time of their decision on a clock. The flexes came 0.2 seconds after they clocked the decision. But the EEG machine registered significant brain activity 0.3 seconds before the decision. Again, a half second lapse between the beginning of a bodily event and its completion in an outwardly directed, active expression. 

Asked to speculate on what implications all this might have for a doctrine of free will, the researcher, Benjamin Libet, “proposes that we may exert free will not by initiating intentions but by vetoing, acceding or otherwise responding to them after they arise.”

In other words, the half-second is missed not because it is empty, but because it is overfull, in excess of the actually-performed action and of its ascribed meaning. Will and consciousness are subtractive. They are limitative, derived functions which reduce a complexity too rich to be functionally expressed. It should be noted in particular that during the mysterious half-second, what we think of as “free,” “higher” functions, such as volition, are apparently being performed by autonomic, bodily reactions occuring in the brain but outside consciousness, and between brain and finger, but prior to action and expression. The formation of a volition is necessarily accompanied and aided by cognitive functions. Perhaps the snowman researchers of the first story couldn’t find cognition because they were looking for it in the wrong place – in the “mind,” rather than in the body they were monitoring. 

Talk of intensity inevitably raises the objection that such a notion involves an appeal to a pre-reflexive, romantically raw domain of primitive experiential richness – the nature in our culture. It is not that. First, because something happening out of mind in a body directly absorbing its outside cannot exactly said to be experienced. Second, because volition, cognition, and presumably other “higher” functions usually presumed to be in the mind, figured as a mysterious container of mental entities that is is somehow separate from body and brain, are present and active in that now not-so “raw” domain. Resonation assumes feedback. “Higher functions” belonging to the realm of qualified form/content in which identified, self-expressive persons interact in conventionalized action-reaction circuits following a linear time-line, are fed back into the realm of intensity and recursive causality. The body doesn’t just absorb pulses or discrete stimulations; it infolds contexts, it infolds volitions and cognitions that are nothing if not situated. Intensity is asocial, but not presocial – it includes social elements, but mixes them with elements belonging to other levels of functioning, and combines them according to different logic. How could this be so? Only if the trace of past actions including a trace of their contexts were conserved in the brain and in the flesh, but out of mind and out of body understood as qualifiable interiorities, active and passive respectively, directive spirit and dumb matter. Only if past actions and contexts were conserved and repeated, autonomically reactivated, but not accomplished; begun, but not completed. Intensity is incipience, incipient action and expression.  Intensity is not only incipience, but the incipience of mutually exclusive pathways of action and expression that are then reduced, inhibited, prevented from actualizing themselves completely – all but one. Since the crowd of pretenders to actualization are tending toward completion in a new context, their  incipience cannot just be a conservation and reactivation. They are tendencies – in other words, pastnesses opening onto a future, but with no present to speak of. For the present is lost with the missing half-second, passing too quickly to be perceived, too quickly, actually, to have happened.

This requires a reworking of how we think about the body. Something that happens too quickly to have happened, actually, is virtual. The body is as immediately virtual as it is actual. The virtual, the pressing crowd of incipiencies and tendencies, is a realm of potential. In potential is where futurity combines, unmediated, with pastness, where outsides are infolded, and sadness is happy (happy because the press to action and expression is life). The virtual is a lived paradox where what are normally opposites coexist, coalesce, and connect; where what cannot be experienced cannot but be felt – albeit reduced and contained. For out of the pressing crowd an individual action or expression will emerge and be registered consciously. One “wills” it to emerge, to be qualified, to take on socio-linguistic meaning, to enter linear action-reaction circuits, to become a content of one’s life – by dint of inhibition.

Since the virtual is unliveable even as it happens, it can be thought of as a form of superlinear abstraction that does not obey the law of the excluded middle, that is organized differently but is inseparable from the concrete activity and expressivity of the body. The body is as immediately abstract as it is concrete; its activity and expressivity extend, as on their underside, into an incorporeal, yet perfectly real, dimension of pressing potential.

It is Bergson who stands as a philosophical precursor on many of these points: the brain as a center of indetermination; consciousness as subtractive and inhibitive; perception as working to infold extended actions and expressions, and their situatedness, into a dimension of intensity or intension as opposed to extension; the continual doubling of the actual body by this dimension of intensity, understood as a superlinear, superabstract realm of potential; that realm of the virtual as having a different temporal structure, in which past and future brush shoulders with no mediating present, and as having a different, recursive causality; the virtual as cresting in a liminal realm of emergence, where half-actualized actions and expressions arise like waves on a sea to which most no sooner return.

Bergson could profitably be read together with Spinoza. One of Spinoza’s basic definitions of affect is an “affection (in other words an impingement upon) the body, and at the same time the idea of the affection.” This starts sounding suspiciously Bergsonian if it is noted that the body, when impinged upon, is described by Spinoza as being in state of passional suspension in which it exists more outside of itself, more in the abstracted action of the impinging thing and the abstracted context of that action, than within itself; and if it is noted that the idea in question is not only not conscious but is not in the first instance in the “mind.”

In Spinoza, it is only when the idea of the affection is doubled by an idea of the idea of the affection that it attains the level of conscious reflection. Conscious reflection is a doubling over of the idea on itself, a self-recursion of the idea that enwraps the affection or impingement, at two removes. For it has already been removed once, by the body itself. The body infolds the effect of the impingement – it conserves the impingement minus the impinging thing, the impingement abstracted from the actual action that caused it and actual context of that action. This is a first-order idea produced spontaneously by the body: the affection is immediately, spontaneously doubled by the repeatable trace of an encounter, the “form” of an encounter, in Spinoza’s terminology (an infolding, or contraction, of context in the vocabulary of this essay). The trace determines a tendency, the potential, if not yet the appetite, for the autonomic repetition and variation of the impingement. 

Conscious reflection is the doubling over of this dynamic abstraction on itself. The order of connection of such dynamic abstractions among themselves, on a level specific to them, is called mind. The autonomic tendency received second-hand from the body is raised to a higher power to become an activity of the mind. Mind and body are seen as two levels recapitulating the same image/expression event in different but parallel ways, ascending by degrees from the concrete to the incorporeal, holding to the same absent center of a now spectral– and potentialized – encounter. Spinoza’s Ethics is the philosophy of the becoming-active, in parallel, of mind and body, from an origin in passion, in impingement, in so pure and productive a receptivity that it can only be conceived as a third state, an excluded middle, prior to the distinction between activity and passivity: affect. This “origin” is never left behind, but doubles one like a shadow that is always almost perceived, and cannot but be perceived, in effect.

In a different but complementary direction, when Spinoza defines mind and body as different orders of connection, or different regimes of motion and rest, his thinking converges in suggestive ways with Bergson’s theories of virtuality and movement.
It is Gilles Deleuze who reopened the path to these authors, although nowhere does he patch them directly into each other. His work and theirs could profitably be read together with recent theories of complexity and chaos.viii It is all a question of emergence, which is precisely the focus of the various science-derived theories which converge around the notion of self-organization (the spontaneous production of a level of reality having its own rules of formation and order of connection). Affect or intensity in the present account is akin to what is called a critical point, or a bifurcation point, or singular point, in chaos theory and the theory of dissipative structures. This is the turning point at which a physical system paradoxically embodies multiple and normally mutually exclusive potentials, only one of which is “selected.” “Phase space” could be seen as a diagrammatic rendering of the dimension of the virtual. The organization of multiple levels that have different logics and temporal organizations but are locked in resonance with each other and recapitulate the same event in divergent ways, recalls the fractal ontology and nonlinear causality underlying theories of complexity.

The levels at play could be multiplied to infinity: already mentioned are mind and body, but also volition and cognition, at least two orders of language, expectation and suspense, body depth and epidermis, past and future, action and reaction, happiness and sadness, quiescence and arousal, passivity and activity...  These could be seen not as binary oppositions or contradictions, but as resonating levels. Affect is their point of emergence, in their actual specificity; and it is their vanishing point, in singularity, in their virtual coexistence and interconnection – that critical point shadowing every image/expression-event. Although the realm of intensity that Deleuze’s philosophy strives to conceptualize is transcendental in the sense that it is not directly accessible to experience, it is not transcendent, it is not exactly outside experience either. It is immanent to it – always in it but not of it. Intensity and experience accompany one another, like two mutually presupposing dimensions, or like two sides of a coin. Intensity is immanent to matter and to events, to mind and to body and to every level of bifurcation composing them and which they compose. Thus it also cannot but be experienced, in effect – in the proliferations of levels of organization it ceaselessly gives rise to, generates and regenerates, at every suspended moment.ix Deleuze’s philosophy is the point at which transcendental philosophy flips over into a radical immanentism, and empiricism into ethical experimentation. The Kantian imperative to understand the conditions of possible experience as if from outside and above transposes into an invitation to recapitulate, to repeat and complexify, ground level, the real conditions of emergence, not of the categorical, but of the unclassifiable, the unassimilable, the never-yet felt, the felt for less than half a second, again for the first time -- the new. Kant meets Spinoza, where idealism and empiricism turn pragmatic, becoming a midwifery of invention -- with no loss in abstractive or inductive power. Quite the contrary -- both are heightened. But now abstraction is synonymous with an unleashing of potential, rather than its subtraction. And the sense of induction has changed, to a triggering of a process of complexifying self-organization. The implied ethics of the project is the value attached – without foundation, with desire only – to the multiplication of powers of existence, to ever-divergent regimes of action and expression

FEEDBACK (DIGRESSION)

A key to the rethinking of affect is the feedback of atoms of “higher” modes of organization into a level of emergence.x The philosopher of science Gilbert Simondon sees this functioning even on the physical level, where “germs” of forms are present in an emergent dimension along with unformed elements such as tropisms (attractors), distributions of potential energy (gradients defining metastabilities), and nonlocalized relations (resonation). According to Simondon, the dimension of the emergent – which he terms the “preindividual” – cannot be understood in terms of form, even if it infolds forms in a germinal state. It can only be analyzed as a continuous but highly differentiated field that is “out of phase” with formed entities (has a different topology and causal order from the “individuals” which arise from it and whose forms return to it).xi A germinal or “implicit” form cannot be understood as a shape or structure. It is more a bundle of potential functions localized, as a differentiated region, within a larger field of potential. In each region, a shape or structure begins to form, but no sooner dissolves, as its region shifts in relation to the others with which it is in tension. There is a kind of bubbling of structuration in a turbulent soup of regions of swirling potential. The regions are separated from each other by dynamic thresholds rather than by boundaries. Simondon calls these regions of potential “quanta,” even as they appear on the macrophysical level, and even on the human levelxii (hence the atomic allusion). The “regions” are as abstract as they are actual, in the sense that they do not define boundaried spaces, but are rather mobile differentiations within an open field characterized by action at a distance between elements (attractors, gradients, resonation). The limits of the region, and of the entire field (the universe), are defined by the reach of its elements’ collective actions at a distance. The limit will not be a sharp demarcation, more like a multidimensional fading to infinity. The field is open in the sense it has no interiority or exteriority: it is limited and infinite. 

“Implicit” form is a bundling of potential functions, an infolding or contraction of potential interactions (intension). The playing out of those potentials requires an unfolding in three-dimensional space and linear time – extension as actualization; actualization as  expression. It is in expression that the fade-out occurs. The limits of the field of emergence are in its actual expression. Implicit form may be thought of as the effective presence of the sum total of a things’s interactions, minus the thing. It is a thing’s relationality autonomized as a dimension of the real. This autonomization of relation is the condition under which “higher” functions feed back. Emergence, once again, is a two-sided coin: one side in the virtual (the autonomy of relation), the other in the actual (functional limitation). What is being termed affect in this essay is precisely this two-sidedness, the simultaneous participation of the virtual in the actual and the actual in the virtual, as one arises from and returns to the other. Affect is this two-sideness as seen from the side of the actual thing, as couched in its perceptions and cognitions. Affect is the virtual as point of view, provided the visual metaphor is used guardedly. For affect is synesthetic, implying a participation of the senses in each other: the measure of a living thing’s potential interactions is its ability to transform the effects of one sensory mode into those of another (tactility and vision being the most obvious but by no means only examples; interoceptive senses, especially proprioception, are crucial).xiii Affects are virtual synesthetic perspectives anchored in (functionally limited by) the actually existing, particular things that embody them. The autonomy of affect is its participation in the virtual. Its autonomy is its openness. Affect is autonomous to the degree to which it escapes confinement in the particular body whose vitality, or potential for interaction, it is. Formed, qualified, situated perceptions and cognitions fulfilling functions of actual connection or blockage, are the capture and closure of affect. Emotion is the intensest (most contracted) expression of that capture – and of the fact that something has always and again escaped. Something remains unactualized, inseparable from but unassimilable to any particular, functionally anchored perspective. That is why all emotion is more or less disorienting, and why it is classically described as being outside of oneself,  at the very point at which one is in most intimately and unshareably in contact with oneself and one’s vitality. If there were no escape, no excess or remainder, no fade-out to infinity, the universe would be without potential, pure entropy, death. Actually existing, structured things live in and through that which escapes them. Their autonomy is the autonomy of affect.

The escape of affect cannot but be perceived, alongside the perceptions that are its capture. This side-perception may be punctual, localized in an event (such as the sudden realization that happiness and sadness are something besides what they are). When it is punctual, it is usually described in negative terms, typically as a form of shock (the sudden interruption of of functions of actual connection).xiv But it is also continuous, like a background perception that accompanies every event, however quotidian. When the continuity of affective escape is put into words, it tends to take on positive connotations. For it is nothing less than the perception of one’s own vitality, one’s sense of aliveness, of changeability (often signified  as “freedom”). One’s “sense of aliveness” is a continuous, nonconscious self-perception (unconscious self-reflection or lived self-referentiality).  It is the perception of this self-perception, its naming and making conscious, that allows affect to be effectively analyzed – as long as a vocabulary can be found for that which is imperceptible but whose escape from perception cannot but be perceived, as long as one is alive.

Simondon notes the connection between self-reflection and affect. He even extends the capacity for self-reflection to all living thingsxvi – although it is hard to see why his own analysis does not constrain him to extend it to all things (is not resonation a kind of self-reflection?). Spinoza could be read as doing this in his definition of the idea of the affection as a trace – one that is not without reverberations. More radically, he sees ideas as attaining their most adequate (most self-organized) expression not in us but in the “mind” of God. But then he defines God as Nature (understood as encompassing the human, the artificial, and the invented). Deleuze is willing to take the step of dispensing with God. One of the things that distinguishes his philosophy most sharply from that of his contemporaries is the notion that ideality is a dimension of matter (also understood as encompassing the human, the artificial, and the invented).

The distinction between the living and the nonliving, the biological and the physical, is not the presence or absence of reflection, but its directness. Our brains and nervous systems effect the autonomization of relation, in an interval smaller than the smallest perceivable, even though the operation arises from perception and returns to it. In the more primitive organisms, this autonomization is accomplished by organism-wide networks of interoceptive and exteroceptive sense-receptors whose impulses are not centralized in a brain. One could say that a jelly-fish is its brain. In all living things, the autonomization of relation is effected by a center of indetermination (a localized or organism-wide function of resonation that de-linearizes causality in order to re-linearize it with a change of direction: from reception to reaction). At the fundamental physical level, there is no such mediation.xviii The place of physical nonmediation between the virtual and the actual is explored by quantum mechanics. Just as “higher” functions are fed back – all the way to the subatomic (i.e., position and momentum) – quantum indeterminacy is fed forward. It rises through the fractal bifurcations leading to and between each of the superposed levels of reality. On each level, it appears in a unique mode adequate to that level. On the level of the physical macrosystems analyzed by Simondon, its mode is potential energy and the margin of “play” it introduces into deterministic systems (epitomized by the three-body problem so dear to chaos theory). On the biological level, it is the margin of undecidability accompanying every perception, which is one with a perception’s transmissibility from one sense to another. On the human level, it is that same undecidability fed forward into thought, as evidenced in the deconstructability of every structure of ideas (as expressed, for example, in Gödel’s incompleteness theorem and in Derrida’s différance). Each individual and collective human level has its peculiar “quantum” mode (various forms of undecidability in logical and signifying systems are joined by emotion on the psychological level, resistance on the political level, the specter of crisis haunting capitalist economies, etc.). These modes are fed back and fed forward into one another, echoes of each other one and all.

The use of concept of the quantum outside quantum mechanics, even as applied to human psychology, is not a metaphor. For each level, it is necessary to find an operative concept for the objective indeterminacy that echoes what on the subatomic level goes by the name of quantum. This involves analyzing every formation as participating in what David Bohm calls an implicate order cutting across all levels and doubled on each.xix Affect is as good a general term as any for the interface between implicate and explicate order.xx Returning to the difference between the physical and the biological, it is clear that there can be no firm dividing line between them, nor between them and the human. Affect, like thought or reflection, could be extended to any or every level, providing that the uniqueness of its functioning on that level is taken into account. The difference between the dead, the living, and the human is a not a question of form or structure, nor of the properties possessed by the embodiments of forms or structures, nor of the qualified functions performed by those embodiments (their utility or ability to do work). The distinction between kinds of things and levels of reality is a question of degree: of the way in which modes of organization (such as reflection) are differentially present on every level, bar the extremes. The extremes are the quantum physical and the human inasmuch as it aspires to or confuses itself with the divine (which occurs wherever notions of eternity, identity, and essence are operative). Neither extreme can be said to exist, although each could be said to be real, in entirely different ways (the quantum is productive of effective reality, and the divine is effectively produced, as a fiction). In between, lies a continuum of existence differentiated into levels, or regions of potential, between which there are no boundaries, only dynamic thresholds. 

As Simondon notes, all of this makes it difficult to speak of either transcendence or immanence.xxi No matter what one does, they tend to flip over into each other, in a kind of spontaneous Deleuzian combustion. It makes little difference if the field of existence (being plus potential; the actual in its relation with the virtual) is thought of as an infinite interiority or a parallelism of mutual exteriorities. You get burned either way. Spinoza had it both ways (an indivisible substance divided into parallel attributes). To the extent that the terms transcendence and immanence connote spatial relations – and they inevitably do – they are inadequate to the task. A philosophical sleight of hand like Spinoza’s is always necessary. The trick is to get comfortable with productive paradox.

All of this – the absence of a clear line of demarcation between the physical, the vital, the human, and the superhuman; the undecideability of immanence and transcendence – also has implications for ethical thought. A common thread running through the varieties of social constructivism currently dominant in cultural theory holds that everything, including nature, is constructed in discourse. The classical definition of the human as the rational animal returns in new permutation: the human as the chattering animal. Only the animal is bracketed: the human as the chattering of culture. This reinstates a rigid divide between the human and the nonhuman, since it has become a commonplace, after Lacan, to make language the special preserve of the human (chattering chimps notwithstanding). Now saying that the quantum level is transformed by our perception is not the same as saying that it is only in our perception; saying that nature is discursively constructed is not necessarily the same as saying that nature is in discourse. Social constructivism easily leads to a cultural solipsism analogous to subjectivist interpretations of quantum mechanics. In this worst case solipsist scenario, nature appears as immanent to culture (as its construct). At best, when the status of nature is deemed unworthy of attention, it is simply shunted aside. In that case it appears, by default, as transcendent to culture (as its inert and meaningless remainder). Perhaps the difference between best and worst is not all that it is cracked up to be. For in either case, nature as naturing, nature as having its own dynamism, is erased. Theoretical moves aimed at ending Man end up making human culture the measure and meaning of all things, in a kind of unfettered anthropomorphism precluding – to take one example – articulations of cultural theory and ecology. It is meaningless to interrogate the relation of the human to the nonhuman if the nonhuman is only a construct of human culture, or inertness. The concepts of nature and culture need serious reworking, in a way that expresses the irreducible alterity of the nonhuman in and through its active connection to the human, and vice versa. Let matter be matter, brains be brains, jellyfish be jellyfish, and culture be nature, in irreducible alterity and infinite connection. 

A final note: the feedback of “higher” functions can take such forms as the deployment of narrative in essays about the breakdown of narrative.

III.

Next story. 
The last story was of the brain. This one is of the brainless. His name is Ronald Reagan. The story comes from a well-known book of pop-neurophysiology by Oliver Sacks.
Sacks describes watching a televised speech by the “Great Communicator” in a hospital ward of patients suffering from two kinds of cognitive dysfunction. Some were suffering from global aphasia, which rendered them incapable of understanding words as such. They could nonetheless understand most of what was said, because they compensated by developing extraordinary abilities to read extraverbal cues: inflection, facial expression, and other gesture – body language. Others on the ward were suffering from what is called tonal agnosia, which is the inverse of aphasia. The ability to hear the expressiveness of the voice is lost, and with it goes attention to other extraverbal cues. Language is reduced to its grammatical form and semantic or logical content. Neither group appeared to be Reagan voters. In fact, the speech was universally greeted by howls of laughter and expressions of outrage. The “Great Communicator” was failing to persuade. To the aphasiacs, he was functionally illiterate in extraverbal cueing; his body language struck them as hilariously inept. He was, after all, a recycled bad actor, and an ageing one at that. The agnosiacs were outraged that the man couldn’t put together a grammatical sentence or follow a logical line to its conclusion. He came across to them as intellectually impaired. (It must be recalled that this is long before the onset of Reagan’s Alzheimer’s disease – what does that say about the difference between normality and degeneration?)

Now all of this might have come as news to those who think of Reagan and other postmodern political stars on the model of charismatic leadership, in which the fluency of a public figure’s gestural and tonal repertoire mesmerize the masses, lulling them into bleary-eyed belief in the content of the mellifluous words. On the contrary, what is astonishing is that Reagan wasn’t laughed and jeered off the campaign podium and was swept into office not once but twice. It wasn’t that people didn’t hear his verbal fumbling or recognize the incoherence of his thoughts. They were the butt of constant jokes and news stories. And it wasn’t that what he lacked on the level of verbal coherence was glossed over by the seductive fluency of his body image. Reagan was more famous for his polyps than his poise, and there was a collective fascination with his faltering health and regular shedding of bits and pieces of himself. The only conclusion is that Reagan was an effective leader not in spite of but because of his double dysfunction. He was able to produce ideological effects by non-ideological means; a global shift in the political direction of the United States by falling apart. His means were affective. Once again: affective, as opposed to emotional. This is not about empathy or emotive identification, or any form of identification for that matter.

Reagan politicized the power of mime. That power is in interruption. A mime decomposes movement, cuts its continuity into a potentially infinite series of submovements punctuated by jerks. At each jerk, at each cut into the movement, the potential is there for the movement to veer off in another direction, to become a different movement. Each jerk suspends the continuity of the movement, for just a flash, too quick really to perceive – but decisively enough to suggest a veer. This compresses into the movement under way potential movements that are in some way made present without being actualized. In other words, each jerk is a critical point, a singular point, a bifurcation point. At that point, the mime almost imperceptibly intercalates a flash of virtuality into the actual movement under way. The genius of the mime is also the good fortune of the bad actor. Reagan’s gestural idiocy had a mime effect. As did his verbal incoherence, in the register of meaning. He was a communicative jerk. The two levels of interruption, those of linear movement and conventional progressions of meaning, were held together by the one Reagan feature that did, I think, hold positive appeal – the timbre of his voice, that beautifully vibratory voice. Two parallel lines of abstractive suspense resonated together. His voice embodied the resonation. It embodied the abstraction. It was the embodiment of an asignifying intensity doubling his every actual move and phrase, following him like the shadow of a mime. It was the continuity of his discontinuities.

Reagan operationalized the virtual in postmodern politics. Alone, he was nothing approaching an ideologue. He was nothing, an idiocy musically coupled with an incoherence. That’s a bit unfair. He was an incipience. He was unqualified and without content. But the incipience that he was, was prolonged by technologies of image transmission, and then relayed by apparatuses, such as the family or the church or the school or the chamber of commerce, which in conjunction with the media acted as part of the nervous system of a new and frighteningly reactive body politic. It was on the receiving end that the Reagan incipience was qualified, given content. Receiving apparatuses fulfilled the inhibitory, limitative function. They selected one line of movement, one progression of meaning, to actualize and implant locally. That is why Reagan could be so many things to so many people; that is why the majority of the electorate could disagree with him on every major issue, but still vote for him. Because he was actualized, in their neighborhood, as a movement and a meaning of their selection – or at least selected for them, with their acquiescence. He was a man for all inhibitions. It was commonly said that he ruled primarily by projecting an air of confidence. That was the emotional tenor of his political manner, dysfunction notwithstanding. Confidence is the emotional translation of affect as capturable life potential; it is a particular emotional expression and becoming-conscious of one’s side-perceived sense of vitality. Reagan transmitted vitality, virtuality, tendency, in sickness and interruption. (“I am in control here,” cried the general, when Reagan was shot. He wasn’t, actually.) The actualizations relaying the Reagan incipience varied. But with the exception of the cynical, the aphasic, and the agnosic, they consistently included an overweening feeling of confidence – that of the supposedly sovereign individual within a supposedly great nation at whose helm idiocy and incoherence reigned. In other words, Reagan was many things to many people, but within a general framework of affective jingoism. Confidence is the apotheosis of affective capture. Functionalized and nationalized, it feeds directly into prison construction and neo-colonial adventure.

What is of dire interest now, post-Reagan, is the extent to which he contracted into his person operations that might be argued to be endemic to late-capitalist, image- and information-based economies. Think of the image/expression-events in which we bathe. Think interruption. Think of the fast cuts of the video clip or the too-cool TV commercial. Think of the cuts from TV programming to commercials. Think of the cuts across programming and commercials achievable through zapping. Think of the distractedness of television viewing, the constant cuts from the screen to its immediate surroundings, to the viewing context where other actions are performed in fits and starts as attention flits. Think of the joyously incongruent juxtapositions of surfing the Internet. Think of our bombardment by commercial images off the screen, at every step in our daily rounds. Think of imagistic operation of the consumer object, as turnover time increases as fast as styles can be recycled.  Everywhere, the cut, suspense – incipience. Virtuality, perhaps?

Affect holds a key to rethinking postmodern power after ideology. For although ideology is still very much with us, often in the most virulent of forms, it is no longer encompassing. It no longer defines the global mode of functioning of power. It is now one mode of power in a larger field that is not defined, overall, by ideology.xxvi This makes it all the more pressing to connect ideology to its real conditions of emergence. For these are now manifest, mimed by men of power. One way of conceptualizing the non-ideological means by which ideology is produced might deploy the notions of induction and transduction – induction being the triggering of a qualification, of a containment, an actualization; and transduction being the transmission of an impulse of virtuality from one actualization to another, and across them all (what Guattari calls transversality). Transduction is the transmission of a force of potential that cannot but be felt, simultaneously doubling, enabling and ultimately counteracting the limitative selections of apparatuses of actualization and implantation.xxvii This amounts to proposing an analog theory of image-based power: images as the conveyors of forces of emergence; as vehicles for existential potentialization and transfer. In this, too, there are notable precursors. In particular, Walter Benjamn, whose concept of shock and image bombardment, whose analyses of the unmediated before-after temporality of what he called the “dialectical image,” whose fascination with mime and mimickry, whose connecting of tactility to vision, all have much to offer an affective theory of late-capitalist power.

At this point, the impression may have grown that affect is being touted here as if the whole world could be packed into it. In a way, it can, and is. The affective “atoms” that overfill the jerk of the power-mime are monads, inductive/transductive virtual perspectives fading out in all directions to infinity, separated from one another by dynamic thresholds.xxix They are autonomous, not through closure but through a singular openness. As unbounded “regions” in an equally unbounded affective field, they are in contact with the whole universe of affective potential, as by action at a distance. Thus they have no outside, even though they are differentiated according to which potentials are most apt to be expressed (effectively induced) as their “region” passes into actuality. Their passing into actuality is the key. Affect is the whole world: from the precise angle of its differential emergence. How the element of virtuality is construed – whether past or future, inside or outside, transcendent or immanent, sublime or abject, atomized or continuous – is in a way a matter of indifference. It is all of these things, differently in every actual case. Concepts of the virtual in itself are important only to the extent to which they contribute to a pragmatic understanding of emergence, to the extent to which they enable triggerings of change (induce the new). It is the edge of virtual, where it leaks into actual, that counts. For that seeping edge is where potential, actually, is found.

Resistance is manifestly not automatically a part of image reception in late capitalist cultures. But neither can the effect of the mass-media and other image and information-based media simply be explained in terms of a lack: a waning of affect, or a decline in belief, or alienation. The mass media are massively potentializing – but that the potential is inhibited, and both the emergence of the potential and its limitation are part and parcel of the cultural-political functioning of the media, as connected to other apparatuses. Media transmissions are breaches of indetermination. For them to have any specific effect they must be determined to have that effect by apparatuses of actualization and implantation that plug into them and transformatively relay what they give rise to (family, church, school, chamber of commerce, to name but a few). The need actively to actualize media transmission is as true for reactive politics as it is for a politics of resistance, and requires a new understanding of the body in its relation to signification and the ideal or incorporeal. In North America at least, the far right is far more attuned to the imagistic potential of the postmodern body than the established left, and has exploited that advantage for the last decade and a half. Philosophies of affect, potential, and actualization may aid in finding counter-tactics.

Last story:
A man writes a health-care reform bill in his White House. It starts to melt in the media glare. He takes it to the Hill, where it continues to melt. He does not say goodbye. 

Although economic indicators show unmistakeable signs of recovery, the stock market dips. By way of explanation, TV commentators cite a second-hand feeling. The man’s “waffling” on other issues has undermined the public’s confidence in him, and is rebounding on the health-care initiative. The worry is that President Clinton is losing his “presidential” feel. What does that have to do with the health of the economy? The prevailing wisdom among the same commentators is that passage of the health-care would harm the economy. It is hard to see why the market didn’t go up at the news of the”unpresidential” falter of what many “opinion-makers” considered a costly social program inconsistant with basically sound economic policy inherited from the previous administration, credited with starting a recovery. However, the question does not even arise, because the commentators are operating under the assumption that the stock market registers affective fluctuations in adjoining spheres more directly than properly economic indicators. Are they confused? Not according to certain economic theorists who, when called upon to explain to a nonspecialist audience the ultimate foundation of the capitalist monetary system, answer “faith.”xxx And what, in the late-capitalist economy, is the base cause of inflation, according to the same experts? A “mindset,” they say, in which feelings about the future become self-fulfilling prophesies capable of reversing “real” conditions.

The ability of affect to produce an economic effect more swiftly and surely than economics itself means that affect is itself a real condition, an intrinsic variable of the late capitalist system, as infrastructural as a factory. Actually, it is beyond infrastructural, it is everywhere, in effect. Its ability to come second-hand, to switch domains and produce effects across them all, gives it a meta-factorial ubiquity. It is beyond infrastructual. It is transversal.

This fact about affect – this matter-of-factness of affect – needs to be taken seriously into account in cultural and political theory. Don’t forget.

THE BLEED

Where Body Meets Image



SCENARIO
PASSAGE PRECEDES POSITION

	

THE BLEED
It is 1937. The future president of the United States is beginning his first acting job. “There I was– ,” confesses Ronald Reagan, “faced with my nemesis, reading. It isn’t that I flubbed the words, or stumbled and mispro­nounced; I even placed the emphasis on the right syllable. I just lack personality when I read.... The second day I was introduced to the rushes. This is the custom of going at the end of each day’s work and seeing on the screen what you shot the previous day. What a shock it was!”

Fast-forward, mid-paragraph, to 1965, the writing present of the now experienced actor on the cusp of a spectacularly improbable political career. Poised for the campaign for the governorship of California that was to set him on the road to the White House, and apparently no more comfortable with writing than reading, he is co-authoring his first autobiography. One of its primary functions is to explain how half a lifetime as a bad actor actually qualified him for high office, contrary to the then public perception that the roles of entertainer and governor were fundamentally incompat­ible. He couches his explana­tion in terms of a shocking deficiency in movie acting that can only be overcome in the public arena.

It has taken me many years to get used to seeing myself as others see me, and also seeing myself instead of my mental picture of the character I’m playing. First of all, very few of us ever see ourselves except as we look directly at ourselves in a mirror. Thus we don’t know how we look from behind, from the side, walk­ing, standing, moving normally through a room. It’s quite a jolt. Second is the fact that when you read a story you create a mental picture of each character. For the first few years this is true even in reading a script. You don’t see yourself because you haven’t had much experience in seeing yourself. Thus as you act the part, in your mind you envision your mental picture of the author’s character. You go to the rushes and somebody has stolen that heroic figure, and there you are‑-just plain old everyday you‑-up on the screen. It’s one hell of a letdown.

This deceptively complex statement does not condemn acting wholesale, for example on the grounds that it traffics in fakery, substituting appear­ance for reality. In fact, it implies that there is power in acting, which is faulted not for the kind of process it sets in motion but rather for its inability to take that process far enough to realize the power inherent in it. The process in question is seeing. A seeing of oneself. Specifi­cally, a seeing of oneself as others see one. The problem with acting isn’t that it carries the actor out of himself, out of his character into another, out of his real self into a false double; it is that it doesn’t take the actor far enough outside of himself. The movie actor’s success hinges on his ability to see himself as others see him, but this is circumvented by what Reagan calls “mental pictures.” These are private images the actor forms of the character he is portraying, developed from the script. The actor makes words into images, visualizes text, then renders that visualization public by embodying it before the camera. Watching the rushes is a jolt for Reagan precisely because he recognizes himself on the screen. “There you are,” “just plain old everday you.”

That Reagan should be jolted by this is jolting. As he sits in the screening room watching the day’s shoot, he is seeing himself exactly as the director and his fellow actors simultaneously see him, and as the public will later see him. He is indeed seeing himself as others see him. So what’s the problem? And who did he expect to see on the screen, if not himself? And if seeing a film of himself embodying a visualized text is seeing his plain old everyday self, does that mean that in everyday life he is an actor following a script? 

What is clear is that Reagan is not concerned with the difference between reality and appearance. He seems to be speaking of two orders of reality – both of which are composed of appearance, understood more in a performative than epistemological sense. The relevant distinction is not between reality and appearance, true and false, acting and not acting, seeing and not seeing oneself as others see one. The pertinent criterion of evalu­ation is ontological, and cuts across those registers. It bears on the completeness of an appear­ance, which it locates on a scale of intensity, as a higher- or lower-degree reality.

The plain old everyday self is an actor playing an ordinary role in the ordinary way. Reagan  defines that as mirror-like. Mirror-vision is by definition partial. There is a single axis of sight. You see yourself from one angle at a time, and never effectively in movement. If you keep your head motion­less and your eyes level, you can see parts of yourself move, for example your arms, from one perspec­tive. You can change perspective by immobiliz­ing your body and moving your head. But if you try to move your body and your head together in an attempt to catch yourself in motion, you only succeed in jumping from one frozen pose to another. The move­ment between is a blur, barely glimpsed. You can never see yourself “moving normally” as another sees you. Either you see move­ment, but the movement is partial, riveted to a stationary visual axis, stiffened by the effort of maintaining that line of vision, made wooden, deadened, turned into a caricature of itself; or you make a live move­ment at the price of losing sight of yourself for the duration. Every time you really see yourself, well, there you are. The single axis of vision stretches you between two surfaces recapitu­lating the same. On that axis, you resemble yourself perfectly. Stilted, static, a perfect picture. Change is excluded. Change is movement. It is rendered invisible.

This specular structure of doubled identity can be transposed into an intersubjec­tive structure with only slight adjustment. In the everyday intersubjective world there are of course multiple axes of vision, but they are still strung out along a single line that subordi­nates them to resemblance and self-sameness. This line is itself nonvisual, it is a narrative line. In the family or at work, you perform your assigned social role. You interpret the script, you visualize what it means for you to be what your are, parent or child, mother or father, boss or employee, cop or criminal, and  embody­ that visualiz­ation for the benefit of others occupying the contrasting but comple­mentary roles. For each role there is a privileged other, in whose recognition of you, you recognize yourself. You mirror yourself in your supporting actor’s eyes, and they in yours. A reciprocal difference stretches between paired retinal surfaces. Between them runs a narrative line carrying both social players across a series of regulated thresholds. You resemble each other more fundementally than you differ, by virtue of your shared participa­tion in the same narrative. The difference between you and your specular comple­ment is the minimal difference allowing movement. The axes of vision are at slightly skewed angles, so that the mutually self-defining recognition always impercep­tibly misses. This perspectival disjunction creates just enough of an imba­lance to prevent fusion. Saved from stasis, life goes on. There is change, but only minimal change, a skew-induced dynamic distortion generally consistent with sameness. You grow up, grow old, even reverse certain roles, perhaps becoming a parent, in any case turning into an adult after spending your entire life as a child. But you never outgrow yourself, however distorted your aging body and increasingly unfocused mind become. Privileged moments stand out clearly, perfect as pictures in a family album: birthday, graduation, marriage, anniver­sary, celebrating the raise, retirement. Plain old everyday you progresses through a sequence of life passages photo­graphically preserved as stilted poses. Your life passes before you in succeeding tableaux, contin­uity shots punctuat­ing a banal script just bad enough to systematically but modestly miss the mark. There is pro­gression, but no real transform­ation, the movement barely glimpsed. Wherever you go, there you are again. Unavoidably you. Then you die. This is utopia, 1950s style.

Reagan is not content with that. He wants to transcend, to be someone else. He wants to be extraordi­nary, a hero. It jolts him that when he strikes the pose he sees himself. Acting keeps him him, in spite of the fame, because it only allows him to cross a minimal distance, between himself and his complement, in this case the movie goer. Sitting in the screening room, he anticipates his fans crossing that same distance in the opposite direction. He sees them seeing themselves in their recognition of him. He sees himself seen, as privileged other. He wants out of that mirror-vision, but the film stock fixes him in it by objectifying the partial mental picture he embodied. As long as he is in the movies, he is condemned to be what he is, a second-rate actor in a bad fifties film, complementing, compen­sating small lives, on a larger-than-life screen. He is destined for greater things.

Complementarity is not completeness. The completeness Reagan yearns for is to be found in a way of appearing that goes beyond text and visualization, script and picture, beyond the dual structuring of specular identity in which one compensates for a lack in the other. He invokes a kind of vision that grasps exactly and exclusively what mirror-vision misses – the movement, only the movement (“walking, standing, moving normally through a room”). Reagan wants to see the lack in specular identity, and in the process transform it into a peculiar kind of fullness. The movement-vision he looks to is also perspectival (“from behind, from the side”). But its perspectives lie on the far side of a maximum distance, one that can be crossed but not bridged. Occupying one of these perspectives would render Reagan instantly unrecognizable to himself. In that instant, he would have become other, in a way unassimi­lable to reflective identity. Mirror-vision and movement-vision are discontinuous; between them there is no mediation. The first is relative (ongoing reciprocal determi­nation of I-me/I-you), the second is absolute (self-distancing).

Movement-vision is not only discontinuous with mirror-vision. It is discontinuous with itself. To see oneself standing as others see one is not the same as seeing oneself walking as others see one. Maintaining a simple continuity across standing and walking entails positing a commonality between moving and not moving, a generality in which their difference is resolved. It would miss, again, precisely what is being sought: movement as such, in its difference from stasis. The same goes for seeing oneself walking from behind and seeing oneself walking from the side. Movement is relational. Its specificity is compromised if any aspects of the relation are lost to generality – even if it is the generality of the terms in the relation, their self-sameness across time or in different coordinates in space.

Only as a generality can there be said to be a continuity between states (a body standing then walking) guaranteed by a unity of the observer (a subject that remains the same across changes of state in the object). The elementary unit of the space of movement-vision is not a generaliz­ing subject coupled with an object in general – a self-identical observer who recognizes the object as the same, as what is common to different move­ments and to move­ment and stasis. Its elementary unit is the singularity of a movement that includes a perspective which occludes the actual functioning of both the subject and the object. The objectness of the object is attenuated as the subject, seeing itself as others see it, comes to occupy the object’s place as well as its own. Simulta­neously oc­cupying its place and the object’s, the subject departs from itself. The subject-object symmetry of mirror-vision is broken. The subject overlays itself on the object, in a super­position of reciprocal functions. The gap left by the subject’s self-departure is filled not by a new subject or object, but by a process encompas­sing their dis­junction in a tide of change. This disjunctive encompassing is a kind of continuity, but in no way a simple one like that of mirror-vision (one whose implications may be exhausted following a single narrative line). It complicates things. The continuity of movement-vision ­is an included disjunc­tion. It is a continuous dis­place­ment of the subject, the object, and their general relation: the empiri­cal perspec­tive uniting them in an act of recog­nition. It is an opening onto a space of transformation in which a deobjec­tified movement fuses with a desubjectified observer. This larger processuality, this real movement, includes the perspective from which it is seen. But the perspective is that of a virtual observer that is one only with the movement (of the subject’s self-departure). Not: I see you Standing then Walking. But: I (other than) sees me (now you) standing(-from-the-side), standing(-from-behind), walk­ing(-from-the-side), walking(-from-behind).... The elemen­tary unit of the space of movement-vision is a multiply partial other-perspec­tive included in a fractured move­ment-in-itself: change. Change: that which includes rupture but is nevertheless continuous (but only with itself, without complement).

When Reagan enters the space of movement-vision, he is leaving behind the empirical world as he knew it. He is coincid­ing with a perspective that is neither that of his plain old self vis-à-vis the others and objects populating his everyday world, nor that of the others in that world vis-à-vis him as an object in their sight. He leaves the intersub­jec­tive world of the other-in-the-self, self and other identity bound in mutual missed-recogni­tion, for a space of dislocation, the space of movement-as-such, sheer trans­form­ation. There, movement is continuously fractur­ed, unhinged from subject and object, and they from each as other. The eye is out of its socket, hovering on an exorbital axis of vision, seeing elsewhere as a kind of other without other, actually seeing distance, the in-itself of distance, the as-such of differ­ence-from. Seeing oneself as others see one in fact means occupying an axis of vision on a tangent to self and other, both as actual entities and as conditions of identity. It is to enter a space that opens an outside perspec­tive on the self-other, subject-object axis. The tangent point at which movement-vision meets mirror-vision and diverges from it is the space between the subject-object poles, super­posed, fractured, multi­plied. It is relationality in itself, freed from its terms.

How can this be construed as completeness? Clues can be found in Reagan’s recounting of the one time as an actor that he achieved this vision. It happened when he was called upon “to portray a scene of total shock.”v It was in King’s Row, and he had to play a young, handsome “blade” who has an accident and wakes up to find that the bottom half of his body has been amputated. “Coming from unconsciousness to full realiza­tion of what had happened in a few seconds, it presented me with the most challenging acting problem in my career.” Reagan continues:
A whole actor would find such a scene difficult; giving it the necessary dramatic impact as half an actor was murderous. I felt I had neither the experience nor the talent to fake it. I had to find out how it really felt, short of actual amputation. I rehear­sed the scene before mirrors, in corners of the studio, while driving home, in the men’s room of restaurants, before selected friends. At night I would wake up staring at the ceiling and automatically mutter the line before I went back to sleep. I consulted physicians and psychologists; I even talked to people who were so disabled, trying to brew in myself the cauldron of emotions a man must feel who wakes up one sunny morning to find half of himself gone. I got alot of answers. I supplied some more for myself. None of mine agreed with any of theirs. Theirs did not agree with each other. I was stumped.

“Wan and worn” from a sleepless night, a despairing Reagan stumbles into the studio for the shoot: I found the prop men had arranged a neat deception. Under the gay patchwork quilt, they had cut a hole in the mattress and put a supporting box beneath. I stared at it for a minute. Then, obeying an overpowering impulse, I climbed into the rig. I spent almost that whole hour in stiff confinement, contemplating my torso and the smooth undisturbed flat of the covers where my legs should have been. Gradually, the affair began to terrify me. In some weird way, I felt some­thing horrible had happened to my body. Then gradually I became aware that the crew had quietly assembled, the camera was in position, and the set all lighted.... There were cries of “Lights!” and “Quiet, please!” I lay back and closed my eyes, as tense as a fiddlestring. I heard [the director’s] low voice call, “Action!” There was as sharp clack which sig­naled the beginning of the scene. I opened my eyes dazedly, looked around, slowly let my gaze travel downward. I can’t describe even now my feeling as I tried to reach for where my legs should be.... I asked the question – the words that had been haunting me for so many weeks – “Where’s the rest of me?” There was no retake. It was a good scene and it came out that way in the picture. Perhaps I never did quite as well again in a single shot. The reason was that I had put myself, as best I could, in the body of another fellow.... No single line in my career has been as effective in explaining to me what an actor’s life must be.... Seeing the rushes, I could barely believe the colored shadow on the screen was myself.

Reagan was so touched by his truncated self that he organized not just the opening chapter but his entire autobiography around this bed scene, and took that fateful line for its title: Where’s the Rest of Me? The passage is so rich that a close reading, especially in connection with Reagan’s later presidential perform­ances, would prove inexhaust­ible. The discussion here will be limited to retracing and retranslating the process he relives in it.

Reagan begins by saying that he was called upon to “portray” not a character but a “scene.” What he has to embody as an actor is more fundamen­tally an event than a personality. It is something that can’t be faked. He needs to know “how it really felt, short of actual amputation”: his challenge is to produce and coincide with a reality “short of” the actual. The event at issue is the culmination, in a verbalized coming to conscious­ness, of a transform­ation from one bodily state (characterized by mobility, the ability to walk) to a radically different one (character­ized by stasis, being bedrid­den). Reagan must embody the scene of a man recognizing himself as irretriev­ably changed, as having been transported in total darkness and unbeknown to himself from one perspective on life to another that is irreconciliably different from it. The actor’s labour is not one of the intellect – the act of recogni­tion is the end-result, not the means by which the scene’s reality is produced. Acting is a labor of feeling, but not only that. The feeling is inseparable from motility. Reagan becomes a travelling rehearsal. He moves from one place to another, and from one kind of observer to another, repeating the culminating phrase, “where’s the rest of me?” He starts from a difference between two unbridgeable perspec­tives which in their disjunction encompass an entire life, as telescoped into the absolute distance between being able to walk and being a cripple. Then he tries to learn how to cross from one of these perspec­tives to the other, by multiplying relative perspectives on the event they delimit but do not contain: the accident, by which the self becomes other than it was. The phrase marking the culmina­tion of the event in an act of instan­taneous recognition of self-as-other is dragged by his body through his everyday world. It functions through repetition as a trace of the transform­ation, a spectre of an ungraspable, unthinkable event haunting the flesh. He recites the phrase to different people from different angles: to himself in mirrors, alone in the car, in front of friends, phys­icians, psychol­ogists, and ampu­tees. He repeats it so often it becomes auto­matic. The event, still a trace, begins to circulate freely through all of the interlock­ing visual fields compos­ing Reagan’s empirical world. Finally, Reagan’s realm, that of the ordinary, and the realm of the extraordi­nary, the realm of the ungras­pable event, begin to contami­nate one another in a gradual contagion. Reagan’s entire world becomes colored by amputa­tion. He is stumped, repeatedly refer­ring to himself as a cripple. But he isn’t, actually, and he hasn’t yet produced the short-of actual reality of amputation. He only embodies its anticipation. The problem is that the perspectives he has connected to the event remain relative. They do not “agree.” They now communicate across their difference, but cannot be superposed. It takes an artifice to jolt them into a synthesis. One that Reagan is incapable of constructing. His compulsive rehearsing has only exhausted him and driven him into a panic. He can no longer act, in any sense of the word. His manic activity has only succeeded in working him into a state of heightened excitability that is at the same time the pitch of passivity: he has become a peripatetic panic autonomically repeating a line.

This marks the end of the first phase of the process. The second begins with a “deception” prepared without Reagan’s knowledge and to which he is passively subjected. He is loaded into a “rig,” a bed with a hole in it to conceal his legs. His activity in the real world is now suspended by artifice; his anticipation of the event is turned into dramatic suspense as he sinks, quilted, into the scene. Will it happen? For a painful hour, he contemplates his torso. A feeling slowly wells within him. The time of contemplation is like an infolding of his previous activity. As if all of the relative perspec­tives he placed into communication were overlaying themselves on one another and on the disjunct but encompass­ing perspec­tives of the before and after between which he now lies suspended. In this state of suspended animation, he is more than himself, but less than whole. His eyes close. “Action!” His eyes reopen. 

Phase three. The suspension of the suspense by the director’s signal transports him across a blackout of vision into the space of transform­ation. The feeling that was welling inside his body bursts forth in a gesture and a phrase. He bolts up, crying his line. At that moment, he enters the body of another fellow. It’s for real (short of actual). This time, he cannot recog­nize himself in the rushes.

In a way, it is both real and actual. Reagan has been changed by the experience. An actual event really did occur. He feels afterwards that as an actor he is “only half a man” (6). He is cut to the quick by his moment of triumph. The event he recreated has bled into his everyday life, coloring it forever. Reagan laments that he has “become a semi-automaton” (6), and will remain one as long as he is just an actor. The autonomic repetition into which he collapses during the preparatory phase leading up to the event has carried over into his everyday life. He can’t go on that way. He resolves to find the rest of him. He will look for it in conserva­tive politics.

If the event was in a sense real, and if it made him a semi-automaton,  does that mean that finding the rest of him entails becoming a complete automaton? The question is answered by his subse­quent career.

The reason Reagan gives for his determination to complete his transfor­mation is he felt like “a shut-in invalid, nursed by publicity. I have always liked space,” he writes, “the feeling of freedom, a broad range of friends, and variety (not excluding the publication [of the same name])”  (6). Again, it is not the fakeness of acting, nor the media hype, that he is objecting to. Hollywood is simply not big enough for him. He needs more space, more friends and observers, a greater variety of relative perspec­tives through which to circulate as he repeats his lines. Politics will allow him to multiply incalculably the contexts through which he drags his founding event of reality-producing acted amputation, extending the trajectory of its trace, widening the space it colours. If accompanied by adequate artifice, this will allow Reagan to enter innumerable bodies of other “fellows.” These bodies, in their eagerness (or at least willingness) to play their social roles, will have worked themselves into a state of height­ened receptivity, a kind of panicked passivity marked by auto­nomic repetition of assigned lines and a susceptibility to becoming-other, on cue. All the world will be a stage, with Reagan in the leading role, as carrier of a dehumanizing contagion.

To recapitulate: Reagan invents a technology of the event that is also a technology of the self, and a technologizing of the self. He starts from the need to portray a scene culminating in an event that can be taken as exemplary. The accident, in the suddenness of its inclusively disjunctive transformation not only of the shape of a body but of an entire life, can be seen as a figure of the event in general. The generic or exemplary event is short of actual. It need only be acted. But its acting yields a reality of its own. Through his performance of the exemplary event, Reagan effects an actual change in his life. That change is expressed as a blend between the exemplary event and his ordinary world, a bleed between the two. The bleed occurs in a moment of prolonged suspense. Reagan’s activity both as screen actor and as actor in the everyday world is artificially suspended. Reagan’s line of sight is trained on his own body. It moves down his torso toward his waist, his center of gravity, then disappears, as if moving through his body’s center into another space, experienced as one of affect. A feeling wells. Reagan’s vision and body collapse into an inten­sity that increases in pitch the longer it lasts. The way for the welling of that intensity was prepared by extensive means. Reagan had spent his time leading up to the bleed moving between empirical contexts, each of which was characterized by a certain kind of relative perspective, in the sense defined above: an object (always Reagan) appeared before the eyes of various observers (sometimes Reagan), and was recognized as itself. In each context, Reagan repeated the same words. The words were treated as a kind of incantation, as if they enveloped something of the desired event, contained its trace. Their repetition deposited a trace of the event in each of the contexts, gradually colouring the everyday world. Conversely, each context left its own trace in the words. It is as if the words were absorbing the relative perspectives, absorbing traces of the movements accomplished within them, as well as the movement from one to the other, blending the motion of acting the exemplary event with ordinary circulation through the world. The accumulation immob­ilizes Reagan under its weight. He enters a state of passivity marked by heightened excitability. When he is placed in the rig, he continues to move, but in place. He is reeling, overtaken by vertigo, as if his previous move­ments were repeating themselves in intensity. Unmoving, he circulates between empirical contexts and incantations of the exemplary event. He relives them sequentially and simultaneous­ly, as if he can pass into each of those contexts and perform all of his rehearsals at the same time without moving his body or parting his lips. He is all eyes and emotion. When his eyes descend to the blankness at his waist, he is only emotion. He is no one, nowhere, in dark­ness. He is in an in-between space composed of accumulated movements bled into one another and folding in upon the body. And he is in an in-between time after before but before after, in a gap of suspended animation following the preparation of the event but preceding its culmination. He is in the space of the duration of an ungraspable event.ix The feeling of the event washes through him (or that in-between of space and time), a wave or vibration that crests in the spoken lines. This time, the repetition of the lines effective­ly produces the event. But the event, as produced, is different. It has the reality of an acted event, a performance: short of actual. The “short of actual” is expres­sed as a prolonga­tion of the intensive in-between­ness of the event in the empirical world. It is a subsidence of the emotion, a flattening of the wave as it spreads out to fill a wider area. Reagan will now be extensively what he just was intensively. He will be an ambulant blend of the ordinary everyday and of the exemplary event: he will be a walking amputee. His flesh will carry the mark of the artifice that jolted him into the event, endowing it with a kind of half-life: he will be a semi-automaton. He will find a method that will take this new self, semi-technolo­gized through acting, through a similar transformation, after which he will feel it to be complete.

FLESHING OUT: DEFINITIONS

Call the closing of Reagan’s eyes as he sees himself at the pitch of panic and exhaustion movement-vision. It is a vision that passes into the body, and through it to another space. Call that infra-empirical space, what the blind-sight of movement-vision sees, the body without an image. The body without an image is an accumulation of relative perspectives and the passages between them, an additive space of utter receptivity retaining and combining past movements, in intensity, extracted from their actual terms. It is less a space in the empirical sense than a gap in space that is also a suspension of the normal unfolding of time. Still, it can be understood as having a spatio­temporal order of its own.

In its spatial aspect, the body without an image is the involution of subject-object relations into the body of the observer, and of that body into itself. Call the spatiality proper to the body without an image quasicorp­oreal­ity.x The quasicorporeal can be thought of as the superposition of the sum total of the relative perspec­tives in which the body has been implicated, as object or subject, plus the passages between them: in other words, as an interlock­ing of overlaid perspectives that nevertheless remain distinct. The involution of space renders these relative perspectives absolute: it registers movement as included disjunction. Subject, object, and their successive emplace­ments in empirical space are subtracted, leaving the pure relationality of process. Quasicorpor­eality is an abstract map of transformation. Its additive subtrac­tion simultaneously constitutes the spatiality of the body without an image and translates it into another kind of time. For pure relationality extracted from its terms can be under­stood at the extreme as a time out of space, a measureless gap in and between bodies and things, an incorporeal interval of change. 
Call that substanceless and durationless moment the pure event. The time of the event does not belong per se to the body in movement-vision, or even to the body without an image. They incur it. It occurs to them. As time-form it belongs to the virtual, defined as that which is maximally abstract yet real, whose reality is that of potential – pure relationality, the interval of change, the in-itself of transformation. It is a time that does not pass, that only comes to pass. It cannot be suspended because, unlike empirical time, it does not flow. The event is super-empiri­cal: it is the crystalli­zation, out the far side of quasicorporeal­ity, of already actualized spatial perspec­tives and emplace­ments into a time-form from which the passing present is excluded, and which for that very reason is as future as it is past, looping directly from one to the other. It is the immediate proximity of before and after. It is nonlinear, moving in two directions at once: out from the actual (as past) into the actual (as future). The actuality it leaves as past is the same actuality to which it no sooner comes as future: from being to becoming.

Thus far the body without an image has been discussed exclu­sively as an optical effect. But here are other modes of perception involved. The spatiality of the body without an image can be understood even more immediately as an effect of proprio­cep­tion, defined as the sensibil­ity proper to the muscles and ligaments, as opposed to tactile sensibility (which is “extero­ceptive”) and visceral sensibility (which is “interoceptive”).xi Tactility is the sensibility of the skin as surface of contact between the perceiving subject and the perceived object. Proprio­ception folds tactility into the body, enveloping the skin’s contact with the external world in a dimension of medium depth: between exodermis and viscera. The muscles and ligaments register as conditions of movement what the skin internalizes as qualities: the hardness of the floor under foot as one looks into a mirror becomes a resistance enabling station and movement; the softness of the fur of a cat becomes a lubricant of hand motion. Propriocep­tion translates the exertions and ease of the body’s encounters with objects into a muscular memory of relationality. This is the cumulative memory of skill, habit, posture. At the same time as proprioception folds tactility in, it draws out the subject’s reactions to the qualities of the objects it perceives through all five senses, bringing them into the motor realm of externaliz­able res­ponse. Proprio­cep­tion effects a double translation of the subject and the object into the body, at a medium depth where the body is only body, having nothing of the putative profundity of the self nor of the superfi­ciality of external encounter. This asubjec­tive and nonobjec­tive medium depth is one of the strata proper to the corpor­eal; it is a dimension of the flesh. The memory it consti­tutes could be diagrammed as a superposition of vectorial fields composed of multiple points in varying relations of movement and rest, pressure and resis­tance, each field corresponding to an action. Since it is composed of interactions subtracted from their actual terms, it is abstract in the same sense as is the included disjunction of movement-vision. Propriocep­tive memory is where the infolded limits of the body meet the mind’s exter­nalized responses, and where both rejoin the quasicorporeal and thence the event. As infolding, the faculty of propriocep­tion operates as a corporeal transformer of tactility into quasicorporeal­ity. It is to the skin what movement-vision is to the eyes. Its vectors are perspectives of the flesh. Although movement-vision opens onto the same space as propriocep­tion, the latter can be said to be the mode of perception proper to the spatiality of the body without an image because it opens exclusively onto that space, whereas the eyes also see in the intersubjec­tive space of mirror-vision, and because it registers qualities directly and continuously as movement, whereas the eyes do not register movement without also registering its arrest, in other words form (the visual image insofar as it is susceptible to geometric express­ion; movement as captured in a still, snapshot, or tableau giving it measure and propor­tion). It is because vision interrupts movement with formed images that it must interrupt itself to see movement as such. 

Movement-vision is sight turned proprioceptive, the eyes reabsorbed into the flesh through a black hole in the geometry of empirical space and a gash in bodily form (the hole in Reagan’s stage bed; amputation). Vision is a mixed mode of perception, registering both form and movement. For it to gain entry into the quasicor­poreal, the realm of pure relation­ality, pure movement, it must throw aside form in favor of unmed­iated participation in the flesh. Movement-vision is retinal muscle, a visual strength flexed in the extremities of exhaustion.

The temporality of the body without an image coincides with the eclipse of the subject in emotion. It is a time of interruption, the moment vision plunges into the body’s suspended animation. It is a gap, like the event, but one that is still attached to empirical time as a punctuation of its linear unfolding. It can be understood as the double, in the actual, of the event, whose reality as pure interval of transformation is virtual, on  the order of potential, more energetic than bodily, incorporeal. Or, its attach­ment to empirical time can be understood as the durational equiva­lent of the edge of the hole in empirical space into which the eyes of movement-vision disappear, in which case it would be the rim of the virtual at the crossroads of the actual. Reserve the term suspense for the temporality proper to the body without an image.

Just as the spatiality of the body without an image opens out onto another time-form, its temporality opens out onto another space. This opening occurs in a second dimension of the flesh: one that is deeper than the stratum of proprio­ception, in the sense that it is farther removed from the surface of the skin; but it is still at a medium depth, in that it also intervenes between the subject and the object. It too involves a cellular memory, and has a mode of perception proper to it: visceral­ity (“interoception”). Visceral sensibility immediate­ly registers excitations gathered by the five “exteroce­ptive” senses, even before they are fully processed by the brain.xiii Walking down a dark street at night in a dangerous part of town, your lungs throw a spasm before you conscious­ly see and can recognize as human the shadow thrown across your path. As you cross a busy noonday street, your stomach turns somersaults before you consciously hear and can identify as brakes the screeching careen­ing toward you. Having survived the danger, you enter your building. Your heart stops before you consciously feel the tap on your shoulder and identify it as the greeting of a friend. The immediacy of visceral perception is so radical that it can be said without exaggeration to precede the exteroceptive sense perception. It anticipates the translation of the sight or sound or touch perception into something recognizable associated with an identifiable object. Call that “something recognizable” a quality (or property). Movement-vision as proprioception su­btracts qualified form from movement; viscerality subtracts quality as such from excitation. It regist­ers intensity. The dimension of viscerality is adjacent to that of propriocep­tion, but they do not overlap. The dimension of proprioception lies midway between stimulus and response, in a region where infolded tactile encounter meets externaliz­ing response to the qualities gathered by all five senses. It performs a synthesis of those intersecting pathways in the medium of the flesh, thus opened to its own quasicorporeality. Viscer­ality, though no less of the flesh, is a rupture in the stimulus-response paths, a leap in place into a space outside action-reaction circuits. Viscerality is the perception of suspense. The space into which it jolts the flesh is one of an inability to act or reflect, a spasmodic passivity, so taut a receptivity that the body is paralyzed until it is jolted back into action-reaction by recognition. Call it the space of passion.xiv Its elementary units are neither the absolute perspec­tives of movement-vision, nor the vectorial fields of propriocep­tion proper, but degrees of intensity. The space of passion constitutes a quasiqualitative realm adjacent to the quasi­corporeal.xv Say that every absolute perspec­tive/vec­torial field composing the quasicorpo­real is associated with a certain intensity, a higher or lower degree of spas­modic passivity. The intensity can be thought of as filling the interval of quasicorporeal space with a time-derivative, as bathing its relationality with spatialized suspense. If quasicorporeality is a maximal­ly abstract spatial matrix, intensity is the nonqualified substance occupy­ing it. Passion, then, is best understood less as an abstract space than as the time-stuff of spatial abstrac­tion. Call the coupling of a unit of quasicor­pore­ality with a unit of passion an affect: an ability to affect and a susceptibility to be affected. An emotion or feeling is a recognized affect, an identified intensity as reinjected into stimulus-response paths, into action-reaction circuits of infolding and external­ization‑-in short, into subject-object relations. Emotion is a contamination of empirical space by affect, which belongs to the body without an image. 

(The need to keep deriving time from space and space from time testifies to the inadequacy of the terms. The body without an image is a seamless spatiotemporal mix [as is empirical space as understood by physics]. Still, time and space concepts are necessary heuristic devices for thinking the speci­fic­ity of the interlock­ing processes contribut­ing to the construc­tion of the body without an image. See chapter 8 below for more on spatiotemporality)

Call proprioception and viscerality taken together – as two comple­mentary dimensions of the “medium”-depth perception most dir­ectly implicated in the body’s registration of the in-betweenness of the incorporeal event – mesoper­cep­tion. Mesoperception is the synesthetic sensibility: it is the medium where input from all five senses meet, across sub-sensate excitation, and become flesh together, tense and quivering. Mesoper­ceptive flesh functions as a corporeal transformer where one sense shades into another over the failure of each, their input translated into movement and affect.xvi Mesoperception can be called sensation for short.

ACTION!

Affect contaminates empirical space through language. Entranced in his trick bed, Reagan moves through quasicorporeal space, accumulat­ing perspec­tives and passages, and with them affects. As regions of his quasicorporeality are superposed upon one another, their associated intensities mount. It is as if the body’s abstract matrix and its nonqual­ified filling form a resonating vessel rising to an unbearable pitch, reaching the point where it can no longer contain itself. The virtual resonation overflows as actual sound. A voice, perhaps his own, speaking words charged with feeling but whose meaning Reagan will not fully under­stand until many years later: “Where’s the rest of me?”

Bedded in passivity, Reagan cannot jolt himself out of his condition. He is freed from the body without an image and returned to the everyday world, albeit a changed man, by the words of another called out as a cue: “Action!” Call the cue-call an order-word. Call the question-response an expression – keeping in mind that the express­ion is precon­ceptual and even presubjective, more an existential cry than a communication. The expression is the unmedi­tated and unmediated speaking of the event by the flesh. It culminates Reagan’s trans­form­ation into half a man. It gives him a demi-self. What it expresses is less an idea or an emotion formed by a signifying subject than an ontological problem posing as an open question the very possibility of constructing such a subject. Feelings and ideas will follow from the expres­sion and, before solving the problem it poses, will develop its problematic nature even further. The line Reagan speaks makes him feel like a cripple, and gives rise to the idea that he has become a semi-automaton. He has found half of himself, but he happens to have found it in the “body of another fellow.” He is on the road to completing himself, to identifying his body, but he got there by mouthing a pre-scripted line that made him into a foreshortened other. Many secondary questions arise. All of them can be condensed into one: how can exalted difference be derived from banal repetition? Repeat: how can a difference born of becoming-other be self-identity? Again: how can higher being arise from abject becoming?

The cue-call or order-word that jolted Reagan into the body of another fellow had the force of a magic incantation. It induced a phenomena of possession verbally manifested in the automaton mouthing of pre-scripted words, that is to say as ventriloquism. Susceptibility to possession and ventriloquism are the requisite skills of the true actor Reagan now embodies. Together they define the actor’s talent: self-affectation. That term should be understood in the double sense of the artificial construction of a self and of the suffusing of that self with affect.
factors that enter in on the level of bare activity, in its own popping up.
Again, nothing would have happened without artifice. Reagan is extracted from the body without an image and delivered to the actuality of his becoming-actor by the good graces of a “rig.” The order-word simply tripped the rig into operation. Call the rigging of becoming induction. The activation of the rig by the order-word culminated his passion by inducing his possession of his body. Although he may think of himself as having been possessed by the other fellow of the script, it is ultimately the body without an image that takes his body, endowing it with a measure of potential. Reagan is now in becoming; his being is “short of actual.”  That is to say, his actual perceptions are coloured by the virtual. Unable to recognize the virtual-in-the-actual, Reagan develops it into feelings and ideas whose combined effect is to transpose it into a future possibility: an ultimate actuality in which the potential that has seeped into his body has been fully realized; the complete man that he desperately wants to become but which, as an ideal of being, prefigures the end of becom­ing. Reagan’s body reenters linear time, although it still carries with it traces of the body without an image, transposed into a phantom amputa­tion. Call the phantom amputation that comes to stand for the body without an image in Reagan’s mind and emotions the exemplary event (or central phantasm) of his life. Call each threshold he passes on the road to his ideal of being, each movement culminated in an everyday context or between contexts, an ordinary event (also a phantasm; as used here, the word phantasm does not connote irreality, quite the contrary; it connotes the mode of reality proper to events, however exalted or ordinary: insistent ontological ungraspabil­ity).

The exemplary event is a deferred completion. But the fact that it takes over his life indicates that Reagan has already attained a comple­tion of sorts. For the ideal implied by the exemplary event to have been produced, Reagan had to have rejoined the body without an image for a spasmodic moment. His empirical body was completed by its virtual double. The word “completion” is misleading. In the case of the exemplary event, it is misleading because it is not attainable: it denotes an ideal being, and as such lies beyond the reach of becoming. Call the ideal of being-complete unity. The ideas, emo­tions, and mirror-vision images attached to unity keep the ideal alive as the object of a compul­sion or tendency. Call them whole attractors. In the case of the body without an image, “completion” is mislead­ing because it is always already attained at every turn. Call that perpetual future-past doubling ordinary events supple­menta­rity. The exemplary event is the transposi­tion of supple­mentarity into the lure of unity. Transposed supplemen­tarity is the mode of being of the pure event. Call the event, to the extent that it continues to call from across its transposition, defining a compulsion or tendency to fracture the integrity attributed to the body in everyday action-reaction circuits and to shatter the symmetry attributed to subject and object in their mirrored mutuality, a fractal attractor.

Call the seeing of the body without an image by the blind-sight of movement-vision blank mimicry. The activity of the actor is less to imitate a character in a script than to mimic in the flesh the incorporeality of the event. Blank mimicry is supplemented seeming (acting injected with real passion and yielding real change) and seeming supplemental (the attainment of real passion and real change through the staging of the body in suspended animation). The rig, the order-word, the question-response, induction, possession, ventriloquism, the development of an emotionally charged ideal of unity and the quest to reach that ideal – all of these are technol­ogies for making seeming being,xviii for making a life of acting, for making something unified of supplemen­tar­ity, something central of liminality, for filling the fractal rim to make a (w)hole.

Reagan could not recognize himself in the rushes of King’s Row. In the screening room, he misrecognized himself as his new ideal. He looked back into the mirror, even as he was marked for ever by movement-vision. He saw himself as other without other that is the body without an image, then blinked and saw himself again as self-in-other, in a mirror image of his own future. His subsequent career would be characterized by a continual flicker between these two visions.
Reagan was a bad actor. This was not an accident. It was the accident, the accident of his career, his fate, his professional cripple­dom. If he had been a good actor, he would not have had to turn to politics in a quest to complete himself. He would have found passion in each new movie. Repetition of that rush would have been enough. He was a real actor only once. He became a politician for life. It is not that there is anything to prevent a good actor from going into politics. But it would be experi­enced as a career choice, not a compulsion. And the kind of political success a good actor could have would be very different, and undoubtedly lesser, than the success Reagan had. As a politician, Reagan did not stop acting, despite his tendency in his first autobiography to portray the two roles as mutually exclusive. He went about completing himself as a political actor.

“He once described to me how he got into politics by accident,” says a former senior Administration official. “He told me he told someone, ‘By God, what am I doing in politics? The kinds of things I’ve done so far are far away from this. But then I thought that a substantial part of the political thing is acting and role playing and I know how to do that. So I used to worry, but I don’t any­more.’”

There he goes again. Repeating lines: “he told me he told someone.” Ventriloquizing himself. Still at it after all those years. Reagan not only did not let go of the technologies of making seeming being; he did nothing to hide them. His spectacular political success in fact hinged on making seeming being visible. Reaganism is the regime of the visibility of seeming being. Reagan’s professional crippledom, his entry into public life, was the exem­plary event allowing the population of an entire nation to develop emotions and ideas along those same lines. As political actor, he catalyzed processes already at work in society. He was the Great Inducer, the national actor-cum-stage director who called a country to action in pursuit of the lofty lure of post-war unity. The amputa­tion written into the script was the “wound” of Vietnam. The all-too-visible rig was TV.

SCENARIO

Find a cultural-theoretical vocabulary specific to the body. Use it to express the unmediated par­ticipation of the flesh in the image (whether “natural” or mass-mediated). Find a logic for the corporeal (body and image) that does not oppose it to the virtual, even as it distinguishes­ them, as dimensions of each other. Find a logic for the virtual (imagelessness and potential) that does not remove it from the real; for example by equating it with the imaginary. Dissever, instead, the imageless from the Ideal. 

For an incorporeal materialism.
See the body get rigged. See the flesh suffuse with artifice, making it as pal­pably political as it is physical. For the artifice is always cued, and the cuing is collec­tive. 
Consider that there is no “raw” perception. That all perception is rehearsed. Even, especially, our most intense, most abject and inspiring, self-perceptions.

REPETITION PRECEDES RESEMBLANCE (even to oneself).xxii
Consider that although change is compatible with repetition, it is nonetheless ontologi­cally prior to sameness. See stasis, see station, as a special case of move­ment (a special case of reiterative movement: that allowing recognition).

PASSAGE PRECEDES POSITION.
Rethink body, subjectivity and social change in terms of movement, affect, force and violence – before code, text and signification. These latter reiterate ar­rest (the Law: where bodies cease, only to mean, and where meaning carries a sentence).
Even an arch-conservative politician can see and reach beyond the law long enough to catalyze a movement. A special case of reiterative movement (that allowing misrecog­nition: of the fractured time of the virtual for future Unity). This is becoming‑-against itself, because subsumed under that Ideal. Against itself, because its self-assigned meaning (“our Unity!”) contradicts its own senseless, eminently effective, rallying cry (“the rest of me?”). Remember the becoming-Reaganoid of America through the 1980s. And well beyond.xxiv Remember how one bad actor shed his self-likeness to steer a nation sameward. This is becoming – at once highly virulent and self-arresting. 
What is left of us, after “our” unity has completed “his” amputation?
Do we, cultural theorists, recognize ourselves in the rushes?
Rig writing, unarresting.
DISSEVER THE IMAGELESS FROM THE IDEAL.





TOO-BLUE
Color-Patch for an Expanded Empiricism

It’s very simple. The researcher asks a subject to match the blue of a certain friend’s eyes. The friend, of course, is absent. The procedure is repeated with the black of the subject’s hat, the red of his own lips, the brown of the bricks of the house he lived in. The idea is to test the effect of memory on color constancy. The researcher is David Katz, working in the first decade of the century.

It isn’t really that simple. As an uncontrolled experiment, unaccounted for variables entered in. All of the things Katz asked to be color-matched were intimate everyday objects, and could thus be expected to be charged with layers of interest and affect. What was being tested, then, was less memory than the co-functioning of affect with memory. Further, Katz assumed that language was operating neutrally. The word “blue” is assumed to play the role of a transparent designator of what two particular things have in common, a pair of eyes in the world at large and a test patch in the laboratory. Language is assumed to be a medium of commonality, in two senses. First, in the sense that it is posited to harbor a generality capable of effectively subsuming two particulars. Second, in the sense that the experimenter and the subject are assumed to have equal access to its operations of neutrality, or to stand in the same relation to “blue” as deployed in the laboratory. The word is used by the experimenter to stage a match or mismatch. The role Katz assigned to language is standardizing: to deploy and guarantee a standard of comparison in order to test a response against it. 

Under  the circumstances, however, the experimenter and the subject do not stand in the same relation to “blue.” There is an asymmetry in their relation to the word, due to the asymmetry of their respective stances in the laboratory context. Language is playing a primarily standardizing function only for the experimenter. For the subject, it is primarily operating as a trigger--for affect and memory. So what Katz has staged is a co-functioning of language, affect and memory. From his stance as experimenter, this complex co-functioning appears simply as a one-to-one correspondence (or lack thereof) between a present test patch and a past perception. Katz hasn’t reduced experience to another level, for example physiology or the physics of light. But he has extracted a simplicity from a complexity of experience. He has extracted a narrow correspondence-effect from a more encompassing asymmetry. What he has done is perform a reduction of experience operating on the level of experience itself. This kind of endo-reduction of experience might be argued to characterize the Gestalt approach to experimentation, of which Katz was an important forerunner.

You could say that this is bad science, and dismiss it out of hand. Or, you could say that it is proto-science or perhaps semi-science, and ask what precisely it semi-did and proto-how. For Katz’s procedure does constitute a kind of empirical investigation, and it did generate a repeatable result with some claim to factuality. The semi-fact is: under these circumstances, a match does not take place. What does the generation of this factoid allow one to think about the co-functioning of language, memory, affect, asymmetrical social relations, lived complexity, and produced simplicity? If you resituate the factoid in that encompassing co-functioning, the stakes change. The problem for the traditional scientist would be how to convert the factoid into a full-fledged fact: to verify it. This would involve purifying the experiment of uncontrolled variables. Language, affect, and social position would have to be neutralized to the greatest extent possible. In other words, ways would have to be found to make memory and color perception approach the physiological limit of bare brain-functioning. This is a more severe reduction than Katz’s. It is no doubt possible to carry out, and would quite possibly yield something of value, perhaps to neurophysiology, which down the line might in turn prove profitable, for example, to medicine, by supplementing its diagnostic or therapeutic techniques. 

But there are other ways of approaching the situation than bare-braining it. For one thing, you could try to think it. Again, you could resituate the factoid in its encompassing co-functioning, and ask what that co-functioning demands or allows one to think. The question is no longer whether the “fact” is truly a fact, or how it might profitably become one. The question bears on the encompassing co-functioning from which the fact or factoid, such as it is, was generated. In other words, what is at stake is no longer factuality and its profitability but rather relation and its genitivity. The question is: what new thoughts does this nexus of productively experienced relation make it possible to think? This is a philosophical question. This is the positive problem of the philosopher. Included in it is the further question: under what circumstances and to what effect might that new-thought relationality and genitivity be extracted from this nexus of experience and inserted into others, variationally? That is the pragmatic problem of the philosopher (or the pragmatic moment of the philosopher’s positive problem). In this second moment philosophical method segues into ethics and politics, just as scientific method relays in periodic fashion into technique and its capitalization.

Now it just so happens that the way in which Katz’s subjects positively produced their mismatch is quite telling. They “almost always” selected a color that was “too bright to match a bright object,” “too dark to match a dark object,” and “too saturated to match an object which is known to have a distinct hue.” The co-functioning of language, memory and affect “exaggerates” color. The exaggeration, Katz remarks, results from the “absolute striking character” of certain “color-peculiarities.” The remembering of a color is not effectively a reproduction of a perception, but a transformation or becoming of it. Matching, it would seem, is not inherent to the mechanism of color memory. Testing a correspondence between a past perception and a present one is what the experimenter does with the memory he is given. He takes the memory-color generated by his subject and submits it to a test of identity. He tests it for standard. What the subject does, it turns out, exceeds the standard. While the experimenter is representing standards, the subject is  surreptitiously trucking with singularity. He or she is exaggeratedly conveying an “absolutely striking peculiarity of color.” The memory of the friend’s eyes is in some way too “blue”: excess. The remembered color exceeds the testable meaning of the word. In the name of color constancy, the subject has expressed a singular and excessive becoming of color. Between “blue” used as the trigger for the production of a memory, and “blue” used to test the identity of that memory, something extra has slipped in which the color-word, as the common property of the experimenter and the subject, does not designate. The too-blue of the friend’s eyes dodges the standardizing language that triggers and tests it. It is spoken or written only negatively, as a miss. It is on that basis that it enters language, in the experimenter’s reporting of the test results. A normative deployment of language has provoked the production of a singular excess of meaning. Then in a second moment, of reporting about the production, that deployment brings the excess-over-itself into itself. Language is operating simultaneously to standardize (reduce) and convey (express) an ineffable singularity of experience.

If, in the interval between triggering and testing by “blue,” the subject is not doing what the experimenter is doing--setting up a correspondence between a past and present perception--then what exactly is he or she doing with color? Or is that even the right question? Isn’t the question rather: What is color doing to the subject? For the subject is not even aware of the excess she is producing until the experimenter reports the results. Until then, she is left in the belief that she has made the match. The exaggeration that she effectively produces is the result of some “absolutely striking” peculiarity of color. The subject has been singularly struck by color. Color has struck, and without either the subject or the experimenter willing it so, it has exceeded. It has gone over the instituted line, pushed past the mark set for it by the laboratory setup, as unwilled as it is unmatched by its human hosts. 

This pushiness is what Hume called the “vivacity” of an “impression.” It attests to a self-activity of experience. When color is interrogated by language, it displays a self-insistent dynamism that commands itself to the instituted context, into which it breaks and enters, delivering itself to the questioning. This self-delivery or ingressive activity of experience is neither a common property of the language acts that end up expressing it, nor the sole property of any of the language-users involved. The excess of color slips into language between the experimenter and the subject. It belongs to their joint situation. More precisely, it enters their situation. It is an impersonality of experience that makes social ingress. It becomes personal, when the subject is confronted by another with evidence of his exceptional miss and has to own up to it. The color experience is not fundamentally personal. It is more accurate to say that it becomes personalized, and that it does so only in the playing out of a very particular situation enveloping a social asymmetry: the differential in status and power between the roles of the experimenter and the subject. Experience becomes personal socially. This is attested to by the fact that its pushiness, as personalized, is struck by the social asymmetry. The produced excess is personally owned up to only by the “subject.” The experimenter keeps a distance on its owning. He cleaves to the neutralizing, standardizing operation of language as reportage. For him, the excess appears as an “object” of experience, however unexpected. The “subjectivity” of the experimentee emerges in co-functioning with “objectivity,” maintained against surprise, at a different pole of the same asymmetry. The emergence of the subjective, in this personal sense, and the maintenance of the objective are co-results of the same event. 

The event lies at the intersection of at least two (and in reality many more) process lines. One is the adoption and imposition by the experimenter of the institutional set-up of the experiment, as defined linguistically, architecturally, and on any number of other interlocking levels. Call this the context. Context pre-exists. The possibility of maintaining objectivity in the face of surprise comes from the context’s relative stability as a more or less determinate given. The second process line is the self-insistence of an autonomy of experience. Reserve the term situation for the event of an autonomy of experience pushing into and moving across a context. The color-singularity, by virtue of its self-motivating experiential autonomy can, in and of itself, be considered a kind of impersonal subjectivity. The owned subjectivity with which the experimentee leaves--the public memory of having personally misremembered--is a contextual expression of the insurgent, impersonal subjectivity that is the singularity of color. The personal and impersonal poles of subjectivity lie at two ends of the same process line. At the beginning of the line, a self-activity pushes in from outside. By the end, that vivacity has settled into a stable structural coupling that gives it reportable meaning, as the asymmetrical opposite of the objective. Except that there is no beginning, because the insistent singularity is immemorial, arriving, as far as this context is concerned, out of nowhere. The beginning is an indeterminate givenness, which by virtue of its indeterminacy cannot be said exactly to have pre-existed. But neither can it be expected to end. The next time the subject remembers his friend’s face, those familiar eyes will still be too-blue. Think of Frank Sinatra. The structural capture of the vivacity of color co-exists with its continued autonomy: dead, objectified ... but still. 

Although the singularity of experience has no assignable beginning or end, it does pass thresholds, arriving unbidden into a context, then settling in and no sooner slipping out to seek ingress elsewhere. Its traveling across thresholds from situation to situation may prove to have a periodicity, which if followed provides a more ample expression of its self-activity. Upon that expression a speculative narrative can be built. The narrative is “speculative” because even though the ambulation it follows exhibits a periodic consistency, at each departure the singularity disappears into itself, into its own pure activity (uncontextualized and inter-situational). The next arrival is always across the threshold of that subjective indeterminacy. This makes thoroughly reliable prediction impossible. It is the philosopher’s job to tell the story of that impossibility.

There is a certain slippery eternity to the color’s experienced singularity. Nothing is subtracted from experience when the singularity appears asymmetrically in a given context as a standard-beholden “object” of investigation. Something is added. What has happened is that a reportable (and thus intentionally repeatable, institutionally controllable, stablizable) structural coupling has been added to a traveling autonomy (an unintended, automatic repetition). In any case, experience continues. Experience is an additive “form of transition,”iii a continual motion of intersecting process lines: a co-motion (commotion) of mutual non-exclusion. As William James puts it, experience never stops “streaming,” and its streaming “snow-balls.”

The snow-balling is transformative. The singularity of color struck the prepared context, yielding an unexpected result; and the context structurally struck back, capturing the result for control purposes. The “impression” was mutual. It is this mutuality of transformation that makes it possible to hold, without a hint of contradiction, that the color was produced in context and eternally “insists” on itself, in pushy independence.iv The blue belonging to the situation is both “constructed” by the context, which in large part is language-determined, and insists or persists outside linguistic determination (ex-ists). Constructed and self-standing: far from being an indictment of “reality,” as an anti-speculative “science-warrior” of the Alan Sokal variety might have it, the philosophical story I have just told suggests a human definition of it. The real is that which expresses itself in language upon forcibly breaking-and-entering from an immemorial outside. Again in James’s words, the “ultimate fact” is the certainty of a “really-next-effect” whose nature cannot entirely be foreseen: an indefinite ever “more” “fringing” every determinate context with a timeless margin of chance and newness.v Reality is not fundamentally objective. Before and after it becomes an object it is an inexhaustible reserve of surprise. The real is the snow-balling process that makes a certainty of change. To be expected: the arrival of the new, the uninvited ingress of the singular. Produced and eternal, constructed and self-standing, unaccountably old and ever-changing, captive to context and eluding it, verified and storied, sitting true and in fictive travel to a future context--sci-fi (sci-phi). The fable of the real.

Katz’s color-singularity appears in and to the context structurally stabilized as an object of discourse susceptible to subsequent verification by fine-tuning the experimentation. It is in the same stroke that singularity enters discourse and is structurally stabilized as a proto- or semi-scientific object. The object has a life cylce. It passes from the “ultimate fact” of its unexpected arrival to the status of a “factoid” that is felt to be, and can be meaningfully discussed, but requires further investigation to determine precisely what manner of object it is and what can be done with it. In certain contexts, such as Katz’s, the factoid has a distinct calling to mature into a verified “bare” fact. The life cycle of the object is from active indeterminacy, to vague determination, to useful definition (tending toward the ideal limit of full determination). What we call common sense is the field of the factoid. Anecdote is its characteristic content as a genre of thought. Not all objects complete their life cycle, passing from the status of factoid to bare fact. However, all bare facts are born factoid. Science is not an enclosure. The specialized procedures and discourses of science are constrained by work-a-day circumstance to continually remix with common sense and anecdote, operating inside and outside the laboratory, passing freely across its walls. The maturing object of science emerges from this “mangle” of practice. 

The mangling enters the very heart of scientific method at the moment of “discovery,” when the laboratory set-up has staged a surprise. 

A factoid that hasn’t matured remains a mangled object of anecdotal discourse, or gossip. A factoid that has matured rebecomes one, in addition to being a bare fact. Gossip is the archeology of science, and its general destination. It is in no way to belittle or criticize science to point out this kinship. After all, it is no mean feat to transform the vagueness and changeability of anecdote into a dependable fact. All of technique rests on that transformation.

Every new object of science emerges from a “mangle” of practice in which the specialized procedures and discourses of science remix with common sense and anecdote operating inside and outside the laboratory, passing freely across its walls. A factoid that cannot, will not, or has not yet matured remains a mangled object of anecdotal discourse, or gossip.

When the feat has been accomplished, a life cycle has been completed. A stream of experience has, in James’ and Whitehead’s vocabularies, reached a “terminus.”vii It is important to reiterate that a “terminus” of experience is neither a beginning nor an end per se. Once again, it is a threshold. The object has an afterlife. A technical object continues to evolve, but within the bounds of its definition. It changes, but not noticeably enough to merit a new official name. If it does jump the bounds of its nominal identity, it is because an event has transpired. Something new has arrived in the world. In a very particular context, a new singularity has irrupted, making the context a genitive “situation” again. “More” has come. A new life: more to reality. 

The birth of a new technical object is never a linear progress. It is always an emergence across a threshold of surprise. A new cycle begins, from active indeterminacy, to vague determination, to “full” determination (nominal identity deployed within a conventional sphere of practical dependability). The life of a technical object must always pass through the stages of ultimate fact of experience (rupture/irruption/threshold of existence) and merely-talked-about factoid (semi-objective elaboration) before finally baring itself through experimentation (verification/profitable deployment). For this reason, the history of science is never linear and never pure of context and situation. The history of science cannot be contained in “intellectual history.” It is always “dirtied” by an unavoidable genealogical link to chance event, common sense, and gossip. In short, recounting its story, describing its effective form of transition, demands a broadly Foucaultian genealogy of the kind practiced by Bruno Latour and supported philosophically by Isabelle Stengers. As both authors emphasize, that genealogy must include “transversal” linkages to non-scientific spheres of practice (especially commercial and governmental, most crucially concerning questions of regulation and funding) as well as to proto- or semi-scientific spheres. These latter may not be as formalized as what is recognized as Western science, but are far more elaborated and dependable than common sense and gossip. They attest that there are many degrees of reality or forms of transition populating the interval between factoid and bare fact.viii Each degree has its own contextual habitat, conventions of technique, and modes of transmission from one more or less controlled context to the next. There are degrees of factuality, corresponding to species of science. Gestalt is one such species. As are “traditional knowledges” and informal or “folkloric” knowings of many kinds. These species co-exist, co-adapt, and mutually influence one another. In short, there is a global ecology of knowledge practices.

These are some ways of thinking about the singularity of experience from the angle of its loquacious capture for objectivity and technique. But what of its reserve? What of its self-insistent “stillness”? What of its eternally mercurial subjectivity? Talking about that dimension of the situation requires a different story, with different protagonists, following other lines of process entwined with the one just followed.

The color blue figured in Katz’s experimental situation in divergent capacities. It was differential object. Along one axis, or in one of its differential dimensions, it was matched standard assignable by common consensus to things other than itself and which it equally inhered: a retina and a test patch. It figured as an attribute (or common property incumbent in standardized language use). It was also an asymmetrically owned mismemory that was assumed to be knowable but whose exact nature was yet to be determined by follow-up experimentation. In this dimension, it was a multvalent content, at once of inalienable personalized memory and of a public discourse of knowing capture. When we speak of “an” object, what we are referring to is a complex interweaving of attributes and contents, as subsumed under a nominal identity (a name). “An” object subsumes a multiplicity that evolves situationally. Every object is an evolving differential: a snow-balling, open-ended variation on itself.

But there is more to the object than attributes and contents. There was the Sinatra dimension: ole too-blue eyes. This was the axis of escape, along which the differential object “blue” slipped quietly away from its own growing objectivity. The “too” of the blue was an excess in the situation marking the certainty that the line of experiential self-activity or impersonal subjectivity that has made ingress into the situation and is traveling through it will overspill it, going on to enter other situations, across other thresholds of indeterminacy. The excess was a reserve of recurrence in the situation, vaguely palpable but not definable or confinable. It was the direct presence, in the collective experience, of a “more” of experience: the presence of process.

Call this transsituational dimension of the differential object “blue,” by which it escapes confinement in its objectivity, its quality. Contextually, the object owes this elusive excess to an accumulation of familiarity and fondness that the triggering of the memory automatically brought to the situation. In other words, the quality is an expression of affective “investment.” The process line that jumps the interval from one situation to the next is a continuity of uncontained affect, pre- and post-personal. Affect is the connecting thread of experience. It is the invisible glue that holds the world together. There are, of course, other connecting threads. The interlocking pre-given levels mentioned earlier as defining the context also have their lines of continuity. These were levels of conventionalized discourse and institutional practices like architecture that are heavily discourse-delimited (following Foucault’s analyses). The continuity of these lines hinges on nominal identities. The discursive definition of a context delivers up already-identified differential objects for further growth. This evolution will take place within bounds of recognizability and predictability already implicit in the nominal identity. The circumscribing of evolution by discourse is precisely what makes the context useful--if a bit dead. The line of affect, on the other hand, carries unpredictability into the context, making it eventful. With affect comes vivacity of context: situation. Affect enlivens. Its situation-rocking transsituational drift is the life-glue of the world.xii It is the quality that gives affect its most direct processual expression in the situation. A quality is an expression of the world’s amalgamated liveliness.

The “too” of the blue expressed something besides gluey-ness: an “absolute striking color-particularity” or singularity. Objectively, color is traditionally said to comprise three dimensions: brightness, saturation, and hue. Each time Katz asked one of his experimental subjects to make a match, one of these dimensions pushed itself so forcibly into experience that it falsified the match. The test patch chosen by the subjects must have matched, or in some way stand for, their triggered memory. But if held up to the retina, hat, lip, or brick to which the context demanded it to be attributed, it didn’t match. The memory was an experience-patch of a different color than the verifiable attribute. 

The self-activity of one color-dimension seems to have interacted with the others to produce an unattributable color. The new color was an experienced effect of that interaction. The anomalous memory-color which the subjects experienced in spite of themselves resulted from a self-activating resonance-effect between the ingredient dimensions of color. In other words, the actually experienced memory-color was a free-floating global effect of the ingredients’ interaction. It may have been sparked off by a liveliness of one dimension, but it is no more reducible to that dimension than the spark produced by a striking match is reducible to the combustibility of sulphur. A match spark is as much a product of the wood, the striking surface and the hand as it is of the sulphur and its chemical properties. But even to equate the event of the spark with the interaction of its necessary ingredients would be inaccurate. The spark is the expression of the interaction. It leaps out from it. It takes flight from it, following its own self-extinguishing trajectory. What makes it an event is that it catapults the ingredient’s belonging-together in a way that enables other lines of process to take it up, even as it is extinguished, from the angle of what it may become: fire. The spark-event is the ingredients’ global interaction brought out, in such as way as to stand (or fly) for its own furtherance: its potential. The spark is a sign, served to the eye, of a fire augured for the next strike. It is the coming fire, for the eye, as it might be for the skin (of careless fingers). Two divergent series, in a flash: friction to fire; sight to touch. The spark-event is a self-extinguishing transition-effect (a sign) expressing continuation. At the same stroke, it serves as an effective hinge between discontinuous seriations. The enjoined process lines, however different in kind and divergent in path, are intimately entwined by their hinging on the same event: their being part of the same situation. Contexts are defined by typical interactions between more or less invariant ingredients (the contexts’ meaningful “contents”). Situations express the belonging-together of the ingredients from the angle of their joint potential, their enjoined becoming. Call the signed, expressed belonging-together relationality. Context is to situation as interaction is to relation (as content is to expression).

The anomalous memory-color, for its part, was self-sparking. It is true that it enjoined other lines of process and entered interactions underway, furthering them, unforeseen. But it was unbidden. It was not pre-defined by the context’s type and predictable interactions. If the memory-color was an effect, it was directly that of a self-relationality of color dimensions: a belonging of color to its own peculiarities and vivaciousness. If the memory-color was a content, it was that of a self-active process, a process noncontextual (if invasive of context): purely situational. If the memory-color was an attribute, it was purely that of a potential, rather than of any recognizable object, differential or otherwise. In other words, the “ingredients” and “interaction” it emerged from were virtual. A memory-color, emergent, has all the reality of a spark (and no more). The belonging-together of which it is an expression is virtual, in itself imperceptible. The coming-to-expression of that imperceptibility ended in the actual color-patch selected by the experimentee to stand for the experience in the present, public context. The unseen genesis of that coming-to-an-end was an unmatchable, nonconscious, impersonal, self-expressing autonomy of relation: a “singularity” of no present, neither personal nor public. 

[[REDO]] In what follows, the contrast beween the spark and the color will collapse. In fact, the major stakes of this essay will be to make it collapse. For now, it is enough to remark that both the “objective” interaction and the “subjective” insistence of the experience concern relation and expression.

The visible patch  betrays the autonomy of the relation from which it arose, even as it expresses it.xiii Its durability as a sign lends the memory-color to further investigation aimed at making the mismatch a recognizable content of the experimental context, attributable to an isolatable ingredient of it, in the person of the experimentee. The singularity falls captive to its sign. It is committed to the sign’s duration and manipulability. The singularity is encapsulated, captured, grounded in its redounding sign, its terminal. It will no longer surprise in this or similar contexts. It will cease by degrees to be a singularity, as investigations proceed. Its terminal patching into this context will be countervailed in a certain way by its description. Description defines the singularity in a way that enables it to be inserted into contexts it likewise defines--defines as like contexts. The linguistic sign ungrounds the singularity, without unencapsulating it. Mobility returns to the experience, but at the price of the singularity being regrounded at another level. On that level, patched into phonemes and graphemes, it is converted into a generality of context (an intercontextual element) conveyed in discourse. The terminated experience attains an after-life in standardized word-usage. It is transmitted as a conventional, shareable meaning, a common property of the contexts it enters and of the community of language users populating them.xiv At each usage, it will say its name. What in the emergent sign was a self-extinguishing singularity has, in its posthumous sign, settled into a redundancy. The peculiarity has passed: from surprise to currency. The experience will return to its peculiarity (its vivacity will return to it) only if it withdraws, ever so fleetingly, from its signs; only if it falls, even for an immeasurably slender moment, out of actual discourse; only if it recoils into potential, disappearing into the gap between contexts, leaping, unforeseen all over again, into a new context: only if it re-situates itself. Singularity goes on again, but its on-going is gapped. The continuity of singularity runs, potentially, through actual discontinuities of context.

When the singularity recoils into itself, it unbecomes conventional meaning and rebecomes  affect: a liveliness of self-relation, a quality of self-insistence, a force of re-expression. The rhythm of mutual conversion between meaning and affect, between discursive currency and self-running singularity, between contextual capture and on-going escape, redundant sign and iterative force, termination and return--this is what is meant by experience. 

Experience, hinging as it does on the pure potential out-leapt in the emergent sign, immediately enjoins a multiplication of process lines. Along those lines serially repeated contexts are strung. The contexts, which capture the potential for their own furtherance, are separated by gaps in expression. The gaps are glossed over by discursive groupings of contexts (and of their objective contents, and of their objects’ attributes), organized along axes of declared similarity (nominal identities standardly splayed across object differentials). The ingress of singularity, its expressive leap out of the gap of relation into a particular context or discursively-prepared interaction--this is sensation. Sensation: the ever-again of the never-before; the shock of vivacity; the eternal pushiness of the event-already.xv The rhythm of experience is punctuated by the transition-effect of the sensed, unforeseen. To the discourse-determined linearities of history glossing the gaps of emergence respond periodicities of renewal, unsayable even in their repeated committal to language.

	STRANGE HORIZON:
BUILDINGS, BIOGRAMS, AND THE BODY TOPOLOGIC


The novelty of computer-assisted topological design technique in architecture is wearing off. As the required software has become more accessible, not to mention the hardware required to run it, paperless studios and offices now seem much the less exception. The proponents of the topological turn in architecture have by this time had ample published opportunity to explain its theoretical underpinnings, and have produced an expanding body of design work available for assessment. Whenever a “next wave” starts to crest, its growing familiarity is inevitably accompanied by a backlash. I won’t say “backwash,” even though there are a certain refrains discernible in the reaction that are close to eddying into a prevailing opinion. The criticisms are often articulated in connection with the work of Greg Lynn, whose elegant philosophizing and tantalizingly involuted forms have made him an exemplar of the new approaches. Here are three of them:
1) We do not live in non-Euclidean space. So where do you get off foisting mutant geometries on us that don’t correspond to anything outside the abstract space of the computer? (Subtext: that don’t correspond to anything real).
2) Go on, animate architectural design practice as much as you like, you still end up with a building that isn’t going anywhere. It’s all a sham, because design techniques based on movement rather than static form betray themselves in the fixity of their final product. Where is the continuity between the process and the product? If there is none, what difference do your fancy design methods make? It’s all very pretty, but why should we care?
3) Topological architecture is too abstract. It lacks a concept of the body. Where’s the beef?

Point 3 loops back to 1 on the issue of abstraction. The whole series of objections, which is just a sampling from comments heard at lectures and conferences, pivots on the widely accepted idea that the abstractness of the computerized space of topology contradicts the spatial reality of bodies and buildings. Point 2 assumes this gap between the concreteness of bodies-in-buildings and the abstraction of design method, and demands its redress. The lines are drawn. Bodies versus Lynnian “blobs.”

Topological architects’ responses to body-positive objections have been hesitant, if not evasive. This essay will suggest a possible path for a response. It is unlikely, however, to offer much comfort for partisans of concreteness incarnate. The argument will be that the space of the body is really abstract in a way that cannot be conceptualized in other than topological terms. But this will not leave topological architecture off the meat-hook. For it will also be argued that the new architectures have a way to go before they can claim to effectively build for that abstract bodily reality. The problem, it will appear, is that computer-assisted architecture is not abstract enough. The lines need redrawing. Bodies and blobs.

The Argument from Orientation. It is with some chagrin that I confess to having sat contentedly in my temporary office at the Canadian Centre for Architecture for no less than two months looking at the wrong street out the window. I was looking east onto rue St-Marc. But I was seeing north onto rue Baille. I am sad to report that there is no resemblance between the two scenes. Something was happening in the time it took me to get from the side entry of the building to the door of my office that was seriously disorienting me. But that’s just the half of it. The something seriously disorienting that was happening as I snaked my way through the corridors overpowered the evidence of my eyes. It was completely overriding the clear-as-day visual cues available to me out the window of my office. The sudden realization that my north was everyone else’s east was jarring. True, I hadn’t paid much attention to the scene. But I wasn’t just not paying attention. When it hit me, I had the strangest sensation of my misplaced image of the buildings morphing, not entirely smoothly, into the corrected scene. My disorientation wasn’t a simple lack of attention. I had been positively (if a bit vaguely and absent-mindedly) seeing a scene that wasn’t there. It took a moment’s effort to replace what positively hadn’t been there with what plainly was. When you actively see something that isn’t there, there is only one thing you can call it: a hallucination. It was a worry.

Thinking about it, I realized that I could make my way to and from my office to the exit without error, but if I had been asked to sketch scenes from the corridors or map the route I couldn’t have done it with any accuracy. I had precious little memory of the way--yet I navigated it flawlessly. Correction: I had precious little visual memory of the way. I must have been navigating on autopilot using some form of basically nonvisual memory. If I put myself mentally through the paces of exiting, instead of seeing passing scenes I felt twists and turns coming one after the other with variable speed. I was going on a bodily memory of of my movements, one of contorsion and rhythm rather than visible form. There is in fact a sixth sense directly attuned to the movement of the body: proprioception. It  involves specialized sensors in the muscles and joints. Proprioception is a self-referential sense, in that what it most directly registers are displacements of the parts of the body relative to each other. Vision is an exo-referential sense, registering distances from the eye. 

It appears I had been operating on two separate systems of reference: a predominantly proprioceptive system of reference operating in the tunnel-like bowels of the building, and a predominantly visual system of reference for the vistas outside. The two systems were not calibrated to each other. Or they hadn’t been, until my moment of hallucinatory truth before the window. Their respective spaces of orientation had been noncommunicating, like qualitatively different monads of experience. The idea that this is not as unusual a situation as my initial concern had suggested came to me in the subway on the way home. If you have ever ridden a subway, it is likely that you have had a similarly jarring experience when surfacing to street level. 

That must be it. The paucity of visual cues in tunnel-like places like corridors and subways requires a back-up system to take over from the usual way of orienting: using visible forms grouped into fixed configurations to make what psychologists call cognitive maps. I had a happy ride. Until I thought about how I got there. My memory of getting from the exit of the building to the subway stop just moments before was virtually blank. Not quite (not again): twists and turns in rhythm. I had been on autopilot again. I had gotten to the train by habit--and it was my proprioceptive system of reference that seemed to be the habitual one, window or tunnel, vista or no vista. Clear visual images of forms in mapped configurations now seemed the exception. Landmarks I remembered. Sporadically. Rising into the light from rhythms of movement, as from an unseen ground of orientation, in flux.

Close your eyes and try to make your way to the fridge. Your visual memory of the rooms and the configurations of the furniture will start to fade within seconds. But chances are you will “intuitively” find your way to the food with relatively little difficulty. Especially if you’re begining to get hungry. Orienting by habit is more like intuitively homing in on the food with your eyes closed than it is like reading a map. If you think about it, we all go about most of our everyday lives on habitual auto-pilot, driven by half-conscious tendencies  gnawing at us gently like mild urban hungers. Something, it appears, is rotten on the shelf of spatial-experience theory. Cognitive maps, built on the visual basis of generic three-dimensional forms in Euclidean geometric configurations, aren’t all that they are advertised to be. As a general explanation of orientation, they are past their use-by date. The way we orient is more like a tropism (tendency plus habit) than a cognition (visual form plus configuration).

Research in spatial orientation has been stumbling in the same direction. Recent studies assumed the traditional cognitive model, based on “reading” visual cues embedded in the forms and configurations of objects. It was found, however, that the brain’s ability to orient increased the emptier the space. The conclusion was that humans orient more by the “shape of the space” than the visual characteristics of what’s in it.i But what is the shape of empty space? Indeterminate--except for the rhythm of movement through it, in its twistings and turnings. The studies were suggesting that the proprioceptive self-referential system--the referencing of movement to its own variations--was more dependable, more fundamental to our spatial experience, than the exo-referential visual-cue system. Self-referential orientation is called “dead-reckoning,” after the nautical term.ii It is known to be the basis of many animals’ ability to orient. It is a key element, for example, in homing pigeons’ well-known feats of navigation. Its role in human orientation has significant implications for our understanding of space because it inverts the relation of position to movement. Movement is no longer indexed to position. Rather, position emerges from movment, from a relation of movement to itself. Philosophically, this is no small shift.

It takes little reflection to realize that visual landmarks play a major role in our ability to orient. Landmarks stand out, singularly. Most of us would be capable of weaving them together into a visual map. But to do that, you have to stop and think about it. It takes effort--an effort that interferes with the actual movement of orientation. Cognitive mapping takes over where orientation stops.

The way landmarks function in the actual course of orientation is very different from reading a map. They are what you habitually head for or away from. In other words, they trigger headings. Vectors. Landmarks are like magnetic poles that vectorize the space of orientation. A landmark is a minimal visual cue functioning to polarize movement’s relation to itself in a way that allows us habitually to flow with preferential heading. The vectorial structuring effected by landmarks give the space of orientation a qualitative dimension, expressed in tropistic preference. The cognitive model assumes that visual cues are somehow used to calculate distances, as if our brains were computers pre-programmed in inches and feet. Isn’t it more plausible instead that our bodies are habituated in steps? And that steps relate more directly to other steps than they do to conventional feet? The computational fiction is a natural outgrowth of the assumption that we effectively move through and live in a static, metric or quantitative, Euclidean space. I for one don’t count my way around town. A qualitative space of moving, step-by-step self-reference accords better with my navigationally competent (if at times cognitively challenged) sense of where I am.

Landmarks rise up visibly from a nonvisual sea of self-related movement. They refer more directly to the self-referencing of the movements surrounding them than to each other. Fundamentally, each landmark stands alone with its associated coursings. What they mark most directly is a monad of relation, a patch of motion referencing its own self-variations (the multiple headings it carries). Landmarks and their associated patches of qualitative relation can be plotted to each other to form a map--but only with an additional effort that must first interrupt the actual course of orientation. It is in a second moment, in an added operation, that the quantifiable cognitive product is fed back into the space of movement. This can indeed increase the flexibility and precision of a body’s orienting. But it remains that cognitive mapping is secondarily applied to the experience of space, or the space of experience. This makes it an overcoding--a certain way in which experience folds back on itself. It is very uncommon, a limit-case rarely attained, that we carry within our heads a full and acccurate map of our environment. We wouldn’t have to carry maps on paper if we had them in our brains. No matter how consciously overcoding we like to be, our mappings are riddled with proprioceptive holes threatening at any moment to capsize the cognitive model (like the blurs filled with sea-monsters on medieval maps). No matter how expert or encompassing our cognitive mapping gets, the monstrous sea of proprioceptive dead reckoning is more encompassing still. We are ever aswim in it.

The very notion of cognitive overcoding implies that we orient with two systems of reference used together. The contradiction between them is only apparent. Pragmatically, they co-function. Visual cues and cognitive mappings function as storage devices allowing us more ready reaccess to less habituated proprioceptive patches. They also serve as useful correctives, when we find ourselves hallucinating buildings that positively aren’t there. The reverse is also true: proprioceptive orienting can act as a corrective to visual awareness. When we are momentarily lost, the buildings in front of us are in plain view. They may be strangley familiar, but we still can’t place ourselves. Oddly, the first thing people typically do when they realize they are lost and start trying to reorient is to look away from the scene in front of them, even rolling their eyes skyward. We figure out where we are by putting the plain-as-day visual image back in the proper proprioceptive sea-patch. To do that, we have to interrupt vision, in the same way visual awareness interrupts proprioception. The alarmingly physical sense we feel when we realize we are lost is a bodily registering of the disjunction between the two. Place arise from a dialectic of interference and accord between sense-dimensions.

Our orienting abilities, then, combine the resources of two different dimensions of experience. The places we plainly see as we go about our daily lives are products of a cooperation between two sense systems. A synesthetic system of cross-referencing supplements a systemic duality, exo-referential and self-referential, positional and moving, Euclidean and self-varyingly monadic. Synesthetic cooperation links these dimensions to each other, always locally--specifically, where we are lost. This cross-sense referencing forms a third hinge-dimension of experience. This “lost” dimension of experience is where vision and conscious form-configuration feeds back into the vectorial tendency-plus-habit of proprioception, and where proprioception feeds forward into vision. It is where the two fold into and out of each other. It is this fold in experience.

An aside: If the positioned sights we plainly see always result from synesthetic interference and accord, was there really a difference in nature between the sight I positively saw that wasn’t there out my window, and the one I laboriously replaced it with? Weren’t they just two sides of the same coin: the interference side and the accord side? If every effectively placed experience is a synethetic production, it becomes difficult to maintain that there is a difference in nature between hallucination and perception. Isn’t it just a pragmatic difference, simply between cross-referenced and not cross-referenced? It would stand to reason that there would be a kind of continental drift naturally affecting proprioceptive experience patches due to their self-referential, monadic operation? Their mode of reality demands it. Isn’t getting lost, even seeing things that aren’t there, just a momentary grounding in an impractical dimension of reality? It is the encompassing reality of what we really experience in a spatial way that is the lost dimension, if we try to limit our understanding of space too narrowly to vision and the Euclidean geometry of form in configuration.

Look at things from the proprioceptive side: Its elements are twists and turns, each of which is already defined relationally, or differentially (by the joint nature of the proprioceptors), before entering into relation with each other. That makes the relation entered into among elements a double differentiation. The elements fuse into a rhythm. The multiplicity of constituents fuses into a unity of movement. The resulting “patch” is a self-varying monad of motion: a dynamic form figuring only vectors. Although effective, the dynamic form is neither accurate nor fully visualizable. It is operatively vague, a vector space not containable in metric space. Its is a qualitative space of variation referenced only to its own movement, running on autopilot. It is not a space of measure. To get a static, measurable, accurately positioned, visual form, you have to stop the movement. This capsizes the relation between movement and position. Now position arises out of movement. Static form is extracted from dynamic space, as a quantitative limitation of it. Anexact vector space feeds its self-variational results into the limitative conditions of quantitative, Euclidean space, populated placidly by traditional geometric forms plottable into configurations.

Doesn’t this sound familiar? Doesn’t the proprioceptive experience-patch sound an awful lot like a topological figure in the flesh? Doesn’t the way it all shapes up sound a lot like the way Greg Lynn describes computer-assisted design--starting with differential parameters that automatically combine to govern unities/continuities of self-varying movement, ending only when the program stops running, leaving a Euclidean form as a static witness to its arrested dynamism?iii Doesn’t topological design method digitally repeat what our bodies do noncomputationally as we make our way to and from our work stations? Then when we watch the program run, aren’t we doing it again, slumped before the screen, relatively immobilized? Are we not still repeating our body’s ability to extract form from movement?

The proprioceptive dimension of experience was described as just one of two experiential dimensions. But the two were also described as folding into each other. Is not that folding of the Euclidean and non-Euclidean into and out of each other itself understandable only in topological terms? Is not the hinge-dimension between quantitative and qualitative space itself a topological hyperfigure? The non-Euclidean, qualitative, and dynamic always has one up on the Euclidean, quantitative and static. Simply because to put the two together you have to make a move, you have to fold experience back on itself, have to twist one of its dimensions into the other and cross-reference them both to that operation. This means that all spatialization is operatively encompassed by movement--from which it derives in the first non-place.

The space of experience is really, literally, physically a topological hyperspace of transformation.

“Topology” and “non-Euclidean” are not synonyms. Although most topologies are non-Euclidean, there are Euclidean topologies.iv A Möbius strip or a Klein bottle are Euclidean figures, of one and two dimensions respectively. The distinction that is most relevant here is between topological transformation and static geometric figure: between the process of arriving at a form through continuous deformation, and the determinate form arrived at when the process stops. An infinite number of static figures may be extracted from a single topological transformation. The transformation is a kind of super-figure that is defined not by invariant formal properties, but by continuity of transformation. For example, a torus and a coffee-cup belong to the same topological figure because one can be deformed into the other without cutting. Anything left standing when the deformation is stopped at any moment, in its passage through any point in-between, also belongs to their shared figure. The overall topological figure is continuous and multiple. As a transformation, it is defined by vectors rather than coordinate points. A vector is transpositional: a moving-through points. Because of its vectorial nature, the geometry of the topological  superfigure cannot be separated from its duration. The figure is what runs-through an infinity of static figures. It is not itself determinate, but determinable.  Each static figure stands for its determination, but does not exhaust it. The overall figure exceeds any of its discrete stations, and even all of them taken together as an infinite set. This is because between any two points in Euclidean space, no matter how close, lies another definable point. The transformation joining the points in the same superfigure always falls between Euclidean points. It recedes, continuously, into the between. The topological superfigure in itself is the surplus passing-through between Euclidean spatial coordinates. Logically, it is not sequential, even though it is oriented (vectorial). It is recessively transitional. In this essay, the word “non-Euclidean” is used as a convenient short-hand for a space of this kind: one that cannot be separated from its duration due to a transitional excess of movement. “Non-Euclidean” is a good-enough nontechnical term for dynamic or durational “spaces” that do not fit into the classical Euclidean (actually Cartesian) intuition of space as a triple-axis coordinate-box containing things. In this view, widely thought to correspond to our everyday experience, time is an independent variable adding a fourth, formally distinct, dimension to the traditional three of space. Topologically speaking, space and time are dependent variables. They are not formally distinguishable. They cannot be separated from each other without stopping the process and changing its nature (Euclideanizing it). The relation of the dimensions of space to that of time is one of mutual inclusion. This mutual inclusion, and the strange logical and especially experiential effects associated with it, is what is termed a “hyperspace” for the purposes of this essay. It may be noted in passing that even a Euclidean topological figure may generate a surplus-effect, although in a more static vein. A Möbius strip is a two-dimensional figure whose twisting creates a 2-D effect. A Klein bottle is a two dimensional figure whose folding in on itself creates a 3-D effect. The “effects” are real, but not part of the formal definition of the figure. They are in the figure as it is really experienced, adding another quality to it, in its standing-out from its formal limits. They are extra-definitional stand-out or pop-out effects. The word “hyperspace” may also be applied to experiential surplus-dimension effects of this kind, whatever the geometry. Experience itself may be defined as a hyperdimensional reality: the “being” of the excess of effect over any determinate spatial configuration. As the following argument from synesthesia asserts, the “shape” of experience must be considered a one-sided topological transformation: an abstract, in-between (recessive or pop-out) “surface” for the reception, storage, and reaccess of qualitative hyper-effectivity.

The Argument from Synesthesia. The hinging of the proprioceptive on the visual in the movement of orientation is a synesthetic interfusion. It is not the only one. Each side, for example, enters into its own synesthetic fusion with the tactile: a determinate, positioned sight is a potential touch; the tropism of proprioceptive twisting-and-turning is assisted by potential bumps and the tactile feedback from the soles of our feet. There are many other synesthetic conjunctions, involving all the senses in various combinations, including smell and hearing. Clinical synesthesia is when a hinge-dimension of experience, usually lost to active awareness in the sea-change to adulthood, retains the ability to manifest itself perceptually. In synesthesia, other-sense dimensions become visible, as when sounds are seen as colors. This is not vision as it is thought of cognitively. It is more like other-sense operations at the hinge with vision, registered from its side of the threshold. Synesthetic forms are dynamic. They are not mirrored in thought; they are literal perceptions. They are not reflected upon; they are experienced as events. Synesthetes who gain a measure of willful control over them still perceive them as occurrences in the world, not contents of their heads. They describe summoning them into perception, then moving toward or around them. Synesthetic forms are used by being summoned into present perception then recombined with an experience of movement. And they are useful. They serve as memory aids and orientation devices. Since they work by calling forth a real movement-experience, they retain a privileged connection to proprioception. This is not cue-based form-and-configuration vision. Although synesthetic forms are often called “maps,” they are less cartographic in the traditional sense than “diagrammatic” in the sense now entering architectural discourse.vi They are lived diagrams based on already lived experience, revived to orient further experience. Lived and relived: biograms might be a word for them than “diagrams.”

It is worth paying close attention to how synesthetes describe their “maps.” The biograms are usually perceived as occupying the otherwise empty and dimensionless plane between the eyes and objects in the world. This liminal non-place has been characterized as “peri-personal.” It lies at the border of what we think of as internal, personal space and external, public space. The appearance of the biogram is borderline in time as well. It is accompanied by a feeling of “portentous” déjà vu: an already-past pregnant with futurity, in present perception.vii This makes experiencing the biograms, in the words of one synesthete, dubbed MP in the literature, like “seeing time in space” (wouldn’t that be a good way of describing an event?). They have a feeling of thickness or depth to them, like a “flexible moving 3 dimension.” But the depthlikeness is vague enough that they can still be likened to diaphanous “slides” projected on an invisible screen. They retain a surface character. The “maps” MP draws at the researcher’s request do not satisfy her. Her biograms are not plainly visible forms. They are more-than visual. They are event-perceptions combining senses, tenses, and dimensions on a single surface. Since they are not themselves visual representations, they cannot be accurately representated in mono-sense visual form. Oddly, although they appear in front and in the midst of things, the biograms are “larger than my visual range, like looking at the horizon.” They are geometrically strange: a foreground-surround, like a trick center twisting into an all-encompassing periphery. They are uncontainable either in the present moment or in Euclidean space, which they instead encompass: strange horizon. 

Since they are determinately positioned neither in time nor space, their presence can only be considered a mode of abstraction. They are real--really perceived and mnemonically useful--abstract surfaces of perception. Since they continue indefinitely, in order to bring up certain regions the synesthete has to move around, into, or away from them. She doesn’t actually walk, of course. The movement, though really perceived and mnemonically useful, does not measurably take place in Euclidean space. It is an intensive movement, occuring in place, or more accurately out-placed, in the event. This is an abstract movement on an abstract surface.

The synesthete uses her biograms, for example, to keep track of birthdays. On the birthday biogram, each region stores a conjunction between a date, a name, and a color. When she has to recall a birthday, she will use the color as a landmark, and when she approaches the right colored region, the name and date will appear. The shape and sound of the letters and numbers are stored in the colors, diaphanously merged into them as in a dissolve, or like strands “woven together” in a patch of fabric. They are accessed by a reverse dissolve that is like “pulling out threads.” Shape, sound, and language: of a fabric with color.

She has a unique biogram for everything she needs to remember. The biograms are “not connected in any way.” They are like separate monads of abstract lived experience. Except that in their strange twisting between foreground and horizon each loops back at a certain point into darkness. Each biogram arcs in multicolored mnemonic glory from a sea of shadow. What lies in the darkness at the end of the rainbows? The answer comes without the slightest hesitation: other people’s minds.

Biograms cannot be described without resorting to topology: centers folding into peripheries and out again, arcs, weaves, knots, and unthreadings. Face it. That is to say, you are always facing it. Wherever you are, whoever you are, whatever day or year it is, the biogram is in front of you. The synesthetic form of experience is faced, in something like the sense in which writing is handed.ix Except that a left has a right, and this front doesn’t have a back (yet still has shadow). This means a biogram is a one-sided topological surface--really, strangely, usefully. This is not a metaphor. If there is a metaphor in play, isn’t it rather mathematical representation that is the metaphor for the biogram? The biogram is a literal, graphically diaphanous event-perception. It is what is portented when you remember seeing time in space. 

Synesthesia is considered the norm for infantile perception. The theory is that it becomes so habitual as to fall out of perception in the “normal” course of growing up. It is thought to persist as a nonconscious underpinning of all subsequent perception, as if the objects and scenes we see are all “threads” pulled by habit from a biogrammatic fabric of existence.x The biogram recedes to the background of vision. Unremarked, it continues to operate. It is the mode of being of the intersensory hinge-dimension. Its strange one-sided topology is the general plane of cross-reference not only for sights, sounds, touches, tastes, smells, proprioceptions, but also for numbers, letters, words, even patches of grammar. On that plane, the learned forms that are usually thought of as restricted to a “higher” cultural plane rebecome perceptions. Practice becomes perception. The cognitive model has it that “higher” forms are associative compounds built up from smaller sights and sounds as from elementary building blocks. But the workings of synesthesia impy that the higher forms feed back to the “lower” perceptual level. They enter the general dissolve, on a level with the elementary, fused into the surface, interwoven components of the fabric of life. This makes it impossible to apply to “raw” experience distinctions such as “higher” and “lower,” “perceptual” and “cognitive,” or even “natural” and “cultural.” There is no “raw” experience. Every experience takes place in the already-taken place of higher and lower, where they join for the future. Every experience is a portentous déjà vu at a hinge.

The relevant distinction is between involuntary and elicited. In “normal” perception, biograms emerge involuntarily and operate unawares. In clinical synesthesia, they have an odd status: they are “involuntary and elicited.”xi They retain the surprise of the déjà vu even though they can be summoned forth and consciously navigated with future heading. Eliciting with future heading is not the same as willing. Biograms remain their own creatures, with a peri-personal autonomy from psychological or cognitive containment. They cannot be entirely owned personally, since they emerge from and return to a collective darkness. But they can be tamed, induced to appear and perform feats of memory. They are less like a static image on a slide screen than a live circus act, performed in a ring that lies stage-center and encircles the tent.
	
The clinical synesthete has trained synesthesia, harnessing habitual intersense-connection for conscious memory use. Vision is typically used as a plane of general cross-reference. It is on the abstract surface of color that everything fuses, in way allowing a single thread to be pulled back out as needed, before returning to the fold. All the other senses, and any and every “higher” form, are gathered into color, together with the three dimensions of space and the three dimensions of time. It is as if all the dimensions of experience were compressed into vision. This is why the topology of the biogram is so strangely twisted. It is not due to any lack, say of cognitive organization or of Euclidean accuracy. There are simply too may dimensions of reality compressed into vision. It can’t hold them all in discrete, determinate, harmonious form and configuration. It buckles under the existential pressure.

The biogram is not lacking in order. It is over-organized, loaded with an excess of reality. It is deformed by experiential overfill. It is a hypersurface. Its hyperreality explains  why it is so stubbornly abstract. Since it cannot concretely hold everything it carries, it stores the excess fused in abstraction, ready for useful reaccess. In other words, the hypersurface of synesthetic experience is “real and abstract” in precisely the way Deleuze describes the virtual: as an intense, torsional coalescence of potential individuations. “Pulling out a thread,” or decompressing a differential strand of the fusional weave of experience, involves actualizing a virtuality. That is why the synesthetic perception is always an event or performance pulling determinate form and function out of a larger vagueness, like a rabbit from a one-sided hat.

It was argued earlier that there was no essential difference between perception and hallucination, both being synesthetic creations. The feedback of “higher” forms and their associated functions onto the biogrammatic hypersurface expands the list. There is no fundamental difference between perception, hallucination, and cognition. It was also argued that the separation between the natural and the cultural was not experientially sustainable. In view of this, why not call the unseen out of which the biogram arcs “other people’s minds”? Not particular other people’s minds, of course. The other of them all: an other of particular mindedness from which everyone’s individuated perceptions, memories, and cognitions emerge and to which they return, in a twisting rhythm of appearance and dissolve. In other words, you construe it as a shared incipiency that is also a destiny. What is the other of mindedness? From what does all individual awareness arise and return? Simply: matter. Brain-and-body matter: rumbling sea for the rainbow of experience. The synesthetic hypersurface refracts the activity of matter, through many-dimensioned splendor into color. It is the hinge-plane not only between senses, tenses, and dimensions of space and time, but between matter and mindedness: the involuntary and the elicited. 

Reaccessing the biogram and pulling a determinate strand of organized experience from it is to reapproach the point where the materiality of the body minds itself. It is to catch the becoming-minded of the movements of matter in the act. It is to re-perform the immemorial trick of experience pulling itself rabbit-like out of the black hat of matter. This is quite an ontogenetic contorsion. It involves a hyperreal looping between the impersonal and the “peripersonal.”. It is out of that non- to near-personal loop that a personal strand as such is pulled, at the grande finale. After which there is nothing to do but introduce the next abstract act.

That the personal is the finale distinguishes this synesthetic ontogenesis of experience from phenomenological approaches. For phenomenology, the personal is prefigured or “pre-reflected” in the world, in a closed loop of “intentionality.” The act of perception or cognition is a reflection of what is already “pre-” embedded in the world. It repeats the same structures, expressing where you already were. Every phenomenological event is like returning home.xii This is like the déjà vu without the portent of the new. In the circus of synesthesia, you never really know what act will follow. The rabbit might turn into a dove and fly away. Experience, normal or clinical, is never fully intentional. No matter how practiced the act, the result remains at least as involuntary as it is elicited. Under the biogrammatic heading, the personal is not intentionally prefigured. It is rhythmically re-fused, in a way that always brings something new and unexpected into the loop. The loop is always strangely open (with just one-side, how could it ever reflect itself?).

What if topological architecture could find ways of extending the “diagrams” it designs into “biograms” inhabiting the finished product? What if it could find ways of embedding in the materiality of buildings open invitations for portentous events of individuating déjà vu? Might this be a way of continuing its topological process in its product? 

To do this would require somehow integrating logics of perception and experience into the modeling. Processes like habit and memory would have to be taken into account. As would the reality of intensive movement. Ways would have to be experimented with of architecturally soliciting an ongoing eliciting of emergent forms-functions at the collective hinge of perception, hallucination, and cognition. Techniques would have to be found of overfilling experience, avoiding prefiguring it. The methods would have to operate in a rigorously anexact way, in order to respect the vagueness of the virtual and the openness of its individual endings. 

Architecture could even go synesthetes like MP one better by finding ways of building-in nonvisual hypersurfaces. There is nothing wrong with color, light and darkness. Rainbows of experience are good. But imagine the startling effects that might be achieved by using proprioception as the general plane of cross-referencing. Imagine how positively, qualitatively moving that would be. Practices of architecture allied with experimental art, like the “reversible destiny” architecture of Arakawa and Gins or the “relational” architecture of Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, might have much to contribute. Technologies could be favored that can be twisted away from addressing preexisting forms and functions toward operating directly as technologies of emergent experience. Imagine if these were to become infrastructural to architectural engineering. What better place to start than with the much-touted “new media,” approached not only as design tools but as architectural elements as basic as walls and windows? Could architecture build on the ability of digital technologies to connect and interfuse different spheres of activity on the same operational plane, to new effect? This is a direction in which the work of Lars Spuybroek, among others, is moving.

The Argument from the Facedness of Experience. Whether you are clinically synesthetic or not, wherever you are you are ever facing the continuation of your experience. You are always heading onward. It is relatively easy to say where any given form or configuration that comes into focus along way is located. But where is the heading itself? That is the same as asking, where is the ongoing of experience? It is not in any recognized thing or place. It is in them all, but in each under a different heading. Experience, as it happens, is in difference-of-heading before it goes in any determinate direction. The space of continuing experience is a pure space of differential heading: an indeterminate vector space infusing each step taken in Euclidean space with a potential for having been otherwise directed. The whole of vector space is compressed, in potential, into every step. Taking into consideration the feedback of higher forms discussed above, our concept of this intensive vector space of experience must be broad enough to encompass headings toward qualitatively different planes (habit, memory; vision, proprioception; color, language).

The Argument from Doubling. In synesthesia, remembering is a perceptual event. It is a reactivation of a biogram for purposes of reaccess. If an event-perception is faced, then when a biogram is reaccessed isn’t the synesthete facing a previous facing? Hasn’t experience doubled back on itself like a Möbius strip?
