          Mardohai Simhon claimed the silk scarf he wore around his neck was a mirror.     "Look," he said, "my head is separated from my body by a scarf. Who dares give me the life if I say I walk with a knotted mirror under my chin?     "The scarf reflects a face, and you think it is of flesh.     "Night is the mirror. Day the scarf. Moon and sun reflected features. But my true face, brothers, where did I lose it?"     At his death, a large scar was discovered on his neck.     The meaning of this anecdote was discussed by the rabbis.     Reb Alphandery, in his authority as the oldest, spoke first.     "A double mirror," he said, "separates us from the Lord so that God sees Himself when trying to see us, and we, when trying to see Him, see only our own face."     "Is appearance no more than the reflections thrown back and forth by a set of mirrors?" asked Reb Ephraim. "You are no doubt alluding to the soul, Reb Alphandery, in which we see ourselves mirrored. But the body is the place of the soul, just as the mountain is the bed of the brook. The body has broken the mirror."     "The brook," continued Reb Alphandery, "sleeps on the summit. The brook's dream is of water, as is the brook. It flows for us. Our dreams extend us.    "Do you not remember this phrase of Reb Alsem's: 'We live out the dream of creation, which is God's dream. In the evening our own dreams snuggle down into it like sparrows in their nests.'     "And did not Reb Hames write: 'Birds of night, my dreams explore the immense dream of the sleeping universe.'"     "Are dreams the limpid discourse between the facets of a crystal block?" continued Reb Ephraim. "The world is of glass. You know it by its brilliance, night or day."     "The earth turns in a mirror. The earth turns in a scarf," replied Reb Alphandery.     "The scarf of a dandy with a nasty scar," said Reb Ephraim.                         ("Words are inside breath, as the earth is inside time."                                                                            - Reb Mares)       And Yukel said:      "The bundle of the Wandering Jew contains the earth and more than one star."      "Whatever contains is itself contained," said Reb Mawas.      The story I told you, as well as the commentaries it inspired, will be recorded in the book of the eye. The ladder urges us beyond ourselves. Hence its importance. But in a void, where do we place it?                                                                                ("God is sculpted."                                                                                   - Reb Moyal)
        




Drawn Curtains
 

"Dullness of words where God speaks. A dark which feels  good. Drawn curtains. On the dark page lines continue the  crease and the dream, the space between."  -Reb Rissel

   "Hope: the following page. Do not close the book." 

   "I have turned all the pages of the book without finding hope." 

   "Perhaps hope is the book." 


                                                      2 

   "In my dialogues there are no answers. But sometimes a question 
is the flash of an answer. 
   "My route riddled with crystals."

   And Yukel said: 

   "If an answer were possible death would not travel alongside life, 
life would not have a shadow. The universe would be light. 
   "Contradiction is the scream of a soul drawn and quartered by the 
moment. Did not Reb Sedra write: 'Here is grain for your field: a 
grain of life, a grain of death. The grain of life will nourish your death, 
the grain of death feed your life.'" 

                         ("Death will get the better of me. God can only help 
                         me in the void."

Pre-Dialogue, II
 

...this insignificant interval between death and dying.   One cannot accept or refuse, O death, emptiness, air, sun.
The "I" is the miracle of the "You." 

   "This follows from a certain logic," he said: "the 'I' to designate the 'You,' the 'You' to justify the 'I,' and 'He' for disappearing." 

   There is no present. There is a past haunted by the future and a future tormented by the past. 
   The present is the time of writing, both obsessed with and cut off from an out-of-time brimming with life. 


                              (Now that all is silent within me, will I, who have 
                         hardly known how to talk to myself, still be able to 
                         speak? I almost cannot hear myself any more. On this 
                         'almost' I shall rest my words or, rather, what stub- 
                         bornly still wants to be words--though they be deaf 
                         to the call of the world--an take entire charge of 
                         them. Expressing nothing, they will express me all the 
                         better.) 


   For pain, forgetting is an island of flowers. 
   Sweet smell of emptiness. 

   Fabulous a wing 
   unfolding in the paltry field of things. 

   Night finds no consolation in night, but in the lavish star bespangled with all its lights. 

   Others: a fiction.




 

LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings 
of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped, 
we have heard, and what honor the athelings won! 
Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes, 
from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore, 
awing the earls. Since erst he lay 
friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him: 
for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve, 
till before him the folk, both far and near, 
who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate, 
gave him gifts: a good king he! 
To him an heir was afterward born, 
a son in his halls, whom heaven sent 
to favor the folk, feeling their woe 
that erst they had lacked an earl for leader 
so long a while; the Lord endowed him, 
the Wielder of Wonder, with world's renown. 
Famed was this Beowulf: far flew the boast of him, 
son of Scyld, in the Scandian lands. 
So becomes it a youth to quit him well 
with his father's friends, by fee and gift, 
that to aid him, aged, in after days, 
come warriors willing, should war draw nigh, 
liegemen loyal: by lauded deeds 
shall an earl have honor in every clan. 
Forth he fared at the fated moment, 
sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God. 
Then they bore him over to ocean's billow, 
loving clansmen, as late he charged them, 
while wielded words the winsome Scyld, 
the leader beloved who long had ruled.... 
In the roadstead rocked a ring-dight vessel, 
ice-flecked, outbound, atheling's barge: 
there laid they down their darling lord 
on the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings,    
by the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure 
fetched from far was freighted with him. 
No ship have I known so nobly dight 
with weapons of war and weeds of battle, 
with breastplate and blade: on his bosom lay 
a heaped hoard that hence should go 
far o'er the flood with him floating away. 
No less these loaded the lordly gifts, 
thanes' huge treasure, than those had done 
who in former time forth had sent him 
sole on the seas, a suckling child. 
High o'er his head they hoist the standard, 
a gold-wove banner; let billows take him, 
gave him to ocean. Grave were their spirits, 
mournful their mood. No man is able 
to say in sooth, no son of the halls, 
no hero neath heaven, -- who harbored that freight! 
Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings, 
leader beloved, and long he ruled 
in fame with all folk, since his father had gone 
away from the world, till awoke an heir, 
haughty Healfdene, who held through life, 
sage and sturdy, the Scyldings glad. 
Then, one after one, there woke to him, 
to the chieftain of clansmen, children four: 
Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave; 
and I heard that -- was --'s queen, 
the Heathoscylfing's helpmate dear. 
To Hrothgar was given such glory of war, 
such honor of combat, that all his kin 
obeyed him gladly till great grew his band 
of youthful comrades. It came in his mind 
to bid his henchmen a hall uprear, 
a master mead-house, mightier far 
than ever was seen by the sons of earth, 
and within it, then, to old and young 
he would all allot that the Lord had sent him, 
save only the land and the lives of his men. 
Wide, I heard, was the work commanded, 
for many a tribe this mid-earth round, 
to fashion the folkstead. It fell, as he ordered, 
in rapid achievement that ready it stood there, 
of halls the noblest: Heorot   he named it 
whose message had might in many a land. 
Not reckless of promise, the rings he dealt, 
treasure at banquet: there towered the hall, 
high, gabled wide, the hot surge waiting 
of furious flame.   Nor far was that day 
when father and son-in-law stood in feud 
for warfare and hatred that woke again.    
With envy and anger an evil spirit 
endured the dole in his dark abode, 
that he heard each day the din of revel 
high in the hall: there harps rang out, 
clear song of the singer. He sang who knew 
tales of the early time of man, 
how the Almighty made the earth, 
fairest fields enfolded by water, 
set, triumphant, sun and moon 
for a light to lighten the land-dwellers, 
and braided bright the breast of earth 
with limbs and leaves, made life for all 
of mortal beings that breathe and move. 
So lived the clansmen in cheer and revel 
a winsome life, till one began 
to fashion evils, that field of hell. 
Grendel this monster grim was called, 
march-riever mighty, in moorland living, 
in fen and fastness; fief of the giants 
the hapless wight a while had kept 
since the Creator his exile doomed. 
On kin of Cain was the killing avenged 
by sovran God for slaughtered Abel. 
Ill fared his feud, and far was he driven, 
for the slaughter's sake, from sight of men. 
Of Cain awoke all that woful breed, 
Etins   and elves and evil-spirits, 
as well as the giants that warred with God 
weary while: but their wage was paid them! 
WENT he forth to find at fall of night 
that haughty house, and heed wherever 
the Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone. 
Found within it the atheling band 
asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow, 
of human hardship. Unhallowed wight, 
grim and greedy, he grasped betimes, 
wrathful, reckless, from resting-places, 
thirty of the thanes, and thence he rushed 
fain of his fell spoil, faring homeward, 
laden with slaughter, his lair to seek. 
Then at the dawning, as day was breaking, 
the might of Grendel to men was known; 
then after wassail was wail uplifted, 
loud moan in the morn. The mighty chief, 
atheling excellent, unblithe sat, 
labored in woe for the loss of his thanes, 
when once had been traced the trail of the fiend, 
spirit accurst: too cruel that sorrow, 
too long, too loathsome. Not late the respite; 
with night returning, anew began 
ruthless murder; he recked no whit, 
firm in his guilt, of the feud and crime. 
They were easy to find who elsewhere sought 
in room remote their rest at night, 
bed in the bowers,   when that bale was shown, 
was seen in sooth, with surest token, -- 
the hall-thane's   hate. Such held themselves 
far and fast who the fiend outran! 
Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill 
one against all; until empty stood 
that lordly building, and long it bode so. 
Twelve years' tide the trouble he bore, 
sovran of Scyldings, sorrows in plenty, 
boundless cares. There came unhidden 
tidings true to the tribes of men, 
in sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel 
harassed Hrothgar, what hate he bore him, 
what murder and massacre, many a year, 
feud unfading, -- refused consent 
to deal with any of Daneland's earls, 
make pact of peace, or compound for gold: 
still less did the wise men ween to get 
great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands. 
But the evil one ambushed old and young 
death-shadow dark, and dogged them still, 
lured, or lurked in the livelong night 
of misty moorlands: men may say not 
where the haunts of these Hell-Runes   be. 
Such heaping of horrors the hater of men, 
lonely roamer, wrought unceasing, 
harassings heavy. O'er Heorot he lorded, 
gold-bright hall, in gloomy nights; 
and ne'er could the prince   approach his throne, 
-- twas judgment of God, -- or have joy in his hall. 
Sore was the sorrow to Scyldings'-friend, 
heart-rending misery. Many nobles 
sat assembled, and searched out counsel 
how it were best for bold-hearted men 
against harassing terror to try their hand. 
Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes 
altar-offerings, asked with words    
that the slayer-of-souls would succor give them 
for the pain of their people. Their practice this, 
their heathen hope; twas Hell they thought of 
in mood of their mind. Almighty they knew not, 
Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord, 
nor Heaven's-Helmet heeded they ever, 
Wielder-of-Wonder. -- Woe for that man 
who in harm and hatred hales his soul 
to fiery embraces; -- nor favor nor change 
awaits he ever. But well for him 
that after death-day may draw to his Lord, 
and friendship find in the Father's arms! 
THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene 
with the woe of these days; not wisest men 
assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish, 
loathly and long, that lay on his folk, 
most baneful of burdens and bales of the night. 
This heard in his home Hygelac's thane, 
great among Geats, of Grendel's doings. 
He was the mightiest man of valor 
in that same day of this our life, 
stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker 
he bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he, 
far o'er the swan-road he fain would seek, 
the noble monarch who needed men! 
The prince's journey by prudent folk 
was little blamed, though they loved him dear; 
they whetted the hero, and hailed good omens. 
And now the bold one from bands of Geats 
comrades chose, the keenest of warriors 
e'er he could find; with fourteen men 
the sea-wood   he sought, and, sailor proved, 
led them on to the land's confines. 
Time had now flown;   afloat was the ship, 
boat under bluff. On board they climbed, 
warriors ready; waves were churning 
sea with sand; the sailors bore 
on the breast of the bark their bright array, 
their mail and weapons: the men pushed off, 
on its willing way, the well-braced craft. 
Then moved o'er the waters by might of the wind 
that bark like a bird with breast of foam, 
till in season due, on the second day, 
the curved prow such course had run 
that sailors now could see the land, 
sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills, 
headlands broad. Their haven was found, 
their journey ended. Up then quickly 
the Weders'   clansmen climbed ashore, 
anchored their sea-wood, with armor clashing 
and gear of battle: God they thanked 
for passing in peace o'er the paths of the sea. 
Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman, 
a warden that watched the water-side, 
how they bore o'er the gangway glittering shields, 
war-gear in readiness; wonder seized him 
to know what manner of men they were. 
Straight to the strand his steed he rode, 
Hrothgar's henchman; with hand of might 
he shook his spear, and spake in parley. 
"Who are ye, then, ye armed men, 
mailed folk, that yon mighty vessel 
have urged thus over the ocean ways, 
here o'er the waters? A warden I, 
sentinel set o'er the sea-march here, 
lest any foe to the folk of Danes 
with harrying fleet should harm the land. 
No aliens ever at ease thus bore them, 
linden-wielders:   yet word-of-leave 
clearly ye lack from clansmen here, 
my folk's agreement. -- A greater ne'er saw I 
of warriors in world than is one of you, --   
yon hero in harness! No henchman he 
worthied by weapons, if witness his features, 
his peerless presence! I pray you, though, tell 
your folk and home, lest hence ye fare 
suspect to wander your way as spies 
in Danish land. Now, dwellers afar, 
ocean-travellers, take from me 
simple advice: the sooner the better 
I hear of the country whence ye came. 
To him the stateliest spake in answer; 
the warriors' leader his word-hoard unlocked:-- 
"We are by kin of the clan of Geats, 
and Hygelac's own hearth-fellows we. 
To folk afar was my father known, 
noble atheling, Ecgtheow named. 
Full of winters, he fared away 
aged from earth; he is honored still 
through width of the world by wise men all. 
To thy lord and liege in loyal mood 
we hasten hither, to Healfdene's son, 
people-protector: be pleased to advise us! 
To that mighty-one come we on mickle errand, 
to the lord of the Danes; nor deem I right 
that aught be hidden. We hear -- thou knowest 
if sooth it is -- the saying of men, 
that amid the Scyldings a scathing monster, 
dark ill-doer, in dusky nights 
shows terrific his rage unmatched, 
hatred and murder. To Hrothgar I 
in greatness of soul would succor bring, 
so the Wise-and-Brave   may worst his foes, -- 
if ever the end of ills is fated, 
of cruel contest, if cure shall follow, 
and the boiling care-waves cooler grow; 
else ever afterward anguish-days 
he shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place 
high on its hill that house unpeered! 
Astride his steed, the strand-ward answered, 
clansman unquailing: "The keen-souled thane 
must be skilled to sever and sunder duly 
words and works, if he well intends. 
I gather, this band is graciously bent 
to the Scyldings' master. March, then, bearing 
weapons and weeds the way I show you. 
I will bid my men your boat meanwhile 
to guard for fear lest foemen come, -- 
your new-tarred ship by shore of ocean 
faithfully watching till once again 
it waft o'er the waters those well-loved thanes, 
-- winding-neck'd wood, -- to Weders' bounds, 
heroes such as the hest of fate 
shall succor and save from the shock of war. 
They bent them to march, -- the boat lay still, 
fettered by cable and fast at anchor, 
broad-bosomed ship. -- Then shone the boars    
over the cheek-guard; chased with gold, 
keen and gleaming, guard it kept 
o'er the man of war, as marched along 
heroes in haste, till the hall they saw, 
broad of gable and bright with gold: 
that was the fairest, mid folk of earth, 
of houses neath heaven, where Hrothgar lived, 
and the gleam of it lightened o'er lands afar. 
The sturdy shieldsman showed that bright 
burg-of-the-boldest; bade them go 
straightway thither; his steed then turned, 
hardy hero, and hailed them thus:-- 
"Tis time that I fare from you. Father Almighty 
in grace and mercy guard you well, 
safe in your seekings. Seaward I go, 
gainst hostile warriors hold my watch. 
STONE-BRIGHT the street:   it showed the way 
to the crowd of clansmen. Corselets glistened 
hand-forged, hard; on their harness bright 
the steel ring sang, as they strode along 
in mail of battle, and marched to the hall. 
There, weary of ocean, the wall along 
they set their bucklers, their broad shields, down, 
and bowed them to bench: the breastplates clanged, 
war-gear of men; their weapons stacked, 
spears of the seafarers stood together, 
gray-tipped ash: that iron band 
was worthily weaponed! -- A warrior proud 
asked of the heroes their home and kin. 
"Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields, 
harness gray and helmets grim, 
spears in multitude? Messenger, I, 
Hrothgar's herald! Heroes so many 
ne'er met I as strangers of mood so strong. 
Tis plain that for prowess, not plunged into exile, 
for high-hearted valor, Hrothgar ye seek! 
Him the sturdy-in-war bespake with words, 
proud earl of the Weders answer made, 
hardy neath helmet:--Hygelac's, we, 
fellows at board; I am Beowulf named. 
I am seeking to say to the son of Healfdene 
this mission of mine, to thy master-lord, 
the doughty prince, if he deign at all 
grace that we greet him, the good one, now. 
Wulfgar spake, the Wendles' chieftain, 
whose might of mind to many was known, 
his courage and counsel: "The king of Danes, 
the Scyldings' friend, I fain will tell, 
the Breaker-of-Rings, as the boon thou askest, 
the famed prince, of thy faring hither, 
and, swiftly after, such answer bring 
as the doughty monarch may deign to give. 
Hied then in haste to where Hrothgar sat 
white-haired and old, his earls about him, 
till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there 
of the Danish king: good courtier he! 
Wulfgar spake to his winsome lord:-- 
"Hither have fared to thee far-come men 
o'er the paths of ocean, people of Geatland; 
and the stateliest there by his sturdy band 
is Beowulf named. This boon they seek, 
that they, my master, may with thee 
have speech at will: nor spurn their prayer 
to give them hearing, gracious Hrothgar! 
In weeds of the warrior worthy they, 
methinks, of our liking; their leader most surely, 
a hero that hither his henchmen has led. 
HROTHGAR answered, helmet of Scyldings:-- 
"I knew him of yore in his youthful days; 
his aged father was Ecgtheow named, 
to whom, at home, gave Hrethel the Geat 
his only daughter. Their offspring bold 
fares hither to seek the steadfast friend. 
And seamen, too, have said me this, -- 
who carried my gifts to the Geatish court, 
thither for thanks, -- he has thirty men's 
heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand, 
the bold-in-battle. Blessed God 
out of his mercy this man hath sent 
to Danes of the West, as I ween indeed, 
against horror of Grendel. I hope to give 
the good youth gold for his gallant thought. 
Be thou in haste, and bid them hither, 
clan of kinsmen, to come before me; 
and add this word, -- they are welcome guests 
to folk of the Danes. [To the door of the hall 
Wulfgar went] and the word declared:-- 
"To you this message my master sends, 
East-Danes' king, that your kin he knows, 
hardy heroes, and hails you all 
welcome hither o'er waves of the sea! 
Ye may wend your way in war-attire, 
and under helmets Hrothgar greet; 
but let here the battle-shields bide your parley, 
and wooden war-shafts wait its end. 
Uprose the mighty one, ringed with his men, 
brave band of thanes: some bode without, 
battle-gear guarding, as bade the chief. 
Then hied that troop where the herald led them, 
under Heorot's roof: [the hero strode,] 
hardy neath helm, till the hearth he neared. 
Beowulf spake, -- his breastplate gleamed, 
war-net woven by wit of the smith:-- 
"Thou Hrothgar, hail! Hygelac's I, 
kinsman and follower. Fame a plenty 
have I gained in youth! These Grendel-deeds 
I heard in my home-land heralded clear. 
Seafarers say how stands this hall, 
of buildings best, for your band of thanes 
empty and idle, when evening sun 
in the harbor of heaven is hidden away. 
So my vassals advised me well, -- 
brave and wise, the best of men, -- 
O sovran Hrothgar, to seek thee here, 
for my nerve and my might they knew full well. 
Themselves had seen me from slaughter come 
blood-flecked from foes, where five I bound, 
and that wild brood worsted. I' the waves I slew 
nicors   by night, in need and peril 
avenging the Weders,   whose woe they sought, -- 
crushing the grim ones. Grendel now, 
monster cruel, be mine to quell 
in single battle! So, from thee, 
thou sovran of the Shining-Danes, 
Scyldings'-bulwark, a boon I seek, -- 
and, Friend-of-the-folk, refuse it not, 
O Warriors'-shield, now I've wandered far, -- 
that I alone with my liegemen here, 
this hardy band, may Heorot purge! 
More I hear, that the monster dire, 
in his wanton mood, of weapons recks not; 
hence shall I scorn -- so Hygelac stay, 
king of my kindred, kind to me! -- 
brand or buckler to bear in the fight, 
gold-colored targe: but with gripe alone 
must I front the fiend and fight for life, 
foe against foe. Then faith be his 
in the doom of the Lord whom death shall take. 
Fain, I ween, if the fight he win, 
in this hall of gold my Geatish band 
will he fearless eat, -- as oft before, -- 
my noblest thanes. Nor need'st thou then 
to hide my head;   for his shall I be, 
dyed in gore, if death must take me; 
and my blood-covered body he'll bear as prey, 
ruthless devour it, the roamer-lonely, 
with my life-blood redden his lair in the fen: 
no further for me need'st food prepare! 
To Hygelac send, if Hild   should take me, 
best of war-weeds, warding my breast, 
armor excellent, heirloom of Hrethel 
and work of Wayland.   Fares Wyrd   as she must. 
HROTHGAR spake, the Scyldings'-helmet:-- 
"For fight defensive, Friend my Beowulf, 
to succor and save, thou hast sought us here. 
Thy father's combat   a feud enkindled 
when Heatholaf with hand he slew 
among the Wylfings; his Weder kin 
for horror of fighting feared to hold him. 
Fleeing, he sought our South-Dane folk, 
over surge of ocean the Honor-Scyldings, 
when first I was ruling the folk of Danes, 
wielded, youthful, this widespread realm, 
this hoard-hold of heroes. Heorogar was dead, 
my elder brother, had breathed his last, 
Healfdene's bairn: he was better than I! 
Straightway the feud with fee   I settled, 
to the Wylfings sent, o'er watery ridges, 
treasures olden: oaths he   swore me. 
Sore is my soul to say to any 
of the race of man what ruth for me 
in Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought, 
what sudden harryings. Hall-folk fail me, 
my warriors wane; for Wyrd hath swept them 
into Grendel's grasp. But God is able 
this deadly foe from his deeds to turn! 
Boasted full oft, as my beer they drank, 
earls o'er the ale-cup, armed men, 
that they would bide in the beer-hall here, 
Grendel's attack with terror of blades. 
Then was this mead-house at morning tide 
dyed with gore, when the daylight broke, 
all the boards of the benches blood-besprinkled, 
gory the hall: I had heroes the less, 
doughty dear-ones that death had reft. 
-- But sit to the banquet, unbind thy words, 
hardy hero, as heart shall prompt thee. 
Gathered together, the Geatish men 
in the banquet-hall on bench assigned, 
sturdy-spirited, sat them down, 
hardy-hearted. A henchman attended, 
carried the carven cup in hand, 
served the clear mead. Oft minstrels sang 
blithe in Heorot. Heroes revelled, 
no dearth of warriors, Weder and Dane. 
UNFERTH spake, the son of Ecglaf, 
who sat at the feet of the Scyldings' lord, 
unbound the battle-runes.   -- Beowulf's quest, 
sturdy seafarer's, sorely galled him; 
ever he envied that other men 
should more achieve in middle-earth 
of fame under heaven than he himself. -- 
"Art thou that Beowulf, Breca's rival, 
who emulous swam on the open sea, 
when for pride the pair of you proved the floods, 
and wantonly dared in waters deep 
to risk your lives? No living man, 
or lief or loath, from your labor dire 
could you dissuade, from swimming the main. 
Ocean-tides with your arms ye covered, 
with strenuous hands the sea-streets measured, 
swam o'er the waters. Winter's storm 
rolled the rough waves. In realm of sea 
a sennight strove ye. In swimming he topped thee, 
had more of main! Him at morning-tide 
billows bore to the Battling Reamas, 
whence he hied to his home so dear 
beloved of his liegemen, to land of Brondings, 
fastness fair, where his folk he ruled, 
town and treasure. In triumph o'er thee 
Beanstan's bairn   his boast achieved. 
So ween I for thee a worse adventure 
-- though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been, 
in struggle grim, -- if Grendel's approach 
thou darst await through the watch of night! 
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:-- 
"What a deal hast uttered, dear my Unferth, 
drunken with beer, of Breca now, 
told of his triumph! Truth I claim it, 
that I had more of might in the sea 
than any man else, more ocean-endurance. 
We twain had talked, in time of youth, 
and made our boast, -- we were merely boys, 
striplings still, -- to stake our lives 
far at sea: and so we performed it. 
Naked swords, as we swam along, 
we held in hand, with hope to guard us 
against the whales. Not a whit from me 
could he float afar o'er the flood of waves, 
haste o'er the billows; nor him I abandoned. 
Together we twain on the tides abode 
five nights full till the flood divided us, 
churning waves and chillest weather, 
darkling night, and the northern wind 
ruthless rushed on us: rough was the surge. 
Now the wrath of the sea-fish rose apace; 
yet me gainst the monsters my mailed coat, 
hard and hand-linked, help afforded, -- 
battle-sark braided my breast to ward, 
garnished with gold. There grasped me firm 
and haled me to bottom the hated foe, 
with grimmest gripe. Twas granted me, though, 
to pierce the monster with point of sword, 
with blade of battle: huge beast of the sea 
was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine. 
ME thus often the evil monsters 
thronging threatened. With thrust of my sword, 
the darling, I dealt them due return! 
Nowise had they bliss from their booty then 
to devour their victim, vengeful creatures, 
seated to banquet at bottom of sea; 
but at break of day, by my brand sore hurt, 
on the edge of ocean up they lay, 
put to sleep by the sword. And since, by them 
on the fathomless sea-ways sailor-folk 
are never molested. -- Light from east, 
came bright God's beacon; the billows sank, 
so that I saw the sea-cliffs high, 
windy walls. For Wyrd oft saveth 
earl undoomed if he doughty be! 
And so it came that I killed with my sword 
nine of the nicors. Of night-fought battles 
ne'er heard I a harder neath heaven's dome, 
nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man! 
Yet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch, 
though spent with swimming. The sea upbore me, 
flood of the tide, on Finnish land, 
the welling waters. No wise of thee 
have I heard men tell such terror of falchions, 
bitter battle. Breca ne'er yet, 
not one of you pair, in the play of war 
such daring deed has done at all 
with bloody brand, -- I boast not of it! -- 
though thou wast the bane   of thy brethren dear, 
thy closest kin, whence curse of hell 
awaits thee, well as thy wit may serve! 
For I say in sooth, thou son of Ecglaf, 
never had Grendel these grim deeds wrought, 
monster dire, on thy master dear, 
in Heorot such havoc, if heart of thine 
were as battle-bold as thy boast is loud! 
But he has found no feud will happen; 
from sword-clash dread of your Danish clan 
he vaunts him safe, from the Victor-Scyldings. 
He forces pledges, favors none 
of the land of Danes, but lustily murders, 
fights and feasts, nor feud he dreads 
from Spear-Dane men. But speedily now 
shall I prove him the prowess and pride of the Geats, 
shall bid him battle. Blithe to mead 
go he that listeth, when light of dawn 
this morrow morning o'er men of earth, 
ether-robed sun from the south shall beam! 
Joyous then was the Jewel-giver, 
hoar-haired, war-brave; help awaited 
the Bright-Danes' prince, from Beowulf hearing, 
folk's good shepherd, such firm resolve. 
Then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding 
with winsome words. Came Wealhtheow forth, 
queen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy, 
gold-decked, greeting the guests in hall; 
and the high-born lady handed the cup 
first to the East-Danes' heir and warden, 
bade him be blithe at the beer-carouse, 
the land's beloved one. Lustily took he 
banquet and beaker, battle-famed king. 
Through the hall then went the Helmings' Lady, 
to younger and older everywhere 
carried the cup, till come the moment 
when the ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted, 
to Beowulf bore the beaker of mead. 
She greeted the Geats' lord, God she thanked, 
in wisdom's words, that her will was granted, 
that at last on a hero her hope could lean 
for comfort in terrors. The cup he took, 
hardy-in-war, from Wealhtheow's hand, 
and answer uttered the eager-for-combat. 
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:-- 
"This was my thought, when my thanes and I 
bent to the ocean and entered our boat, 
that I would work the will of your people 
fully, or fighting fall in death, 
in fiend's gripe fast. I am firm to do 
an earl's brave deed, or end the days 
of this life of mine in the mead-hall here. 
Well these words to the woman seemed, 
Beowulf's battle-boast. -- Bright with gold 
the stately dame by her spouse sat down. 
Again, as erst, began in hall 
warriors' wassail and words of power, 
the proud-band's revel, till presently 
the son of Healfdene hastened to seek 
rest for the night; he knew there waited 
fight for the fiend in that festal hall, 
when the sheen of the sun they saw no more, 
and dusk of night sank darkling nigh, 
and shadowy shapes came striding on, 
wan under welkin. The warriors rose. 
Man to man, he made harangue, 
Hrothgar to Beowulf, bade him hail, 
let him wield the wine hall: a word he added:-- 
"Never to any man erst I trusted, 
since I could heave up hand and shield, 
this noble Dane-Hall, till now to thee. 
Have now and hold this house unpeered; 
remember thy glory; thy might declare; 
watch for the foe! No wish shall fail thee 
if thou bidest the battle with bold-won life. 
THEN Hrothgar went with his hero-train, 
defence-of-Scyldings, forth from hall; 
fain would the war-lord Wealhtheow seek, 
couch of his queen. The King-of-Glory 
against this Grendel a guard had set, 
so heroes heard, a hall-defender, 
who warded the monarch and watched for the monster. 
In truth, the Geats' prince gladly trusted 
his mettle, his might, the mercy of God! 
Cast off then his corselet of iron, 
helmet from head; to his henchman gave, -- 
choicest of weapons, -- the well-chased sword, 
bidding him guard the gear of battle. 
Spake then his Vaunt the valiant man, 
Beowulf Geat, ere the bed be sought:-- 
"Of force in fight no feebler I count me, 
in grim war-deeds, than Grendel deems him. 
Not with the sword, then, to sleep of death 
his life will I give, though it lie in my power. 
No skill is his to strike against me, 
my shield to hew though he hardy be, 
bold in battle; we both, this night, 
shall spurn the sword, if he seek me here, 
unweaponed, for war. Let wisest God, 
sacred Lord, on which side soever 
doom decree as he deemeth right. 
Reclined then the chieftain, and cheek-pillows held 
the head of the earl, while all about him 
seamen hardy on hall-beds sank. 
None of them thought that thence their steps 
to the folk and fastness that fostered them, 
to the land they loved, would lead them back! 
Full well they wist that on warriors many 
battle-death seized, in the banquet-hall, 
of Danish clan. But comfort and help, 
war-weal weaving, to Weder folk 
the Master gave, that, by might of one, 
over their enemy all prevailed, 
by single strength. In sooth tis told 
that highest God o'er human kind 
hath wielded ever! -- Thro' wan night striding, 
came the walker-in-shadow. Warriors slept 
whose hest was to guard the gabled hall, -- 
all save one. Twas widely known 
that against God's will the ghostly ravager 
him   could not hurl to haunts of darkness; 
wakeful, ready, with warrior's wrath, 
bold he bided the battle's issue. 
THEN from the moorland, by misty crags, 
with God's wrath laden, Grendel came. 
The monster was minded of mankind now 
sundry to seize in the stately house. 
Under welkin he walked, till the wine-palace there, 
gold-hall of men, he gladly discerned, 
flashing with fretwork. Not first time, this, 
that he the home of Hrothgar sought, -- 
yet ne'er in his life-day, late or early, 
such hardy heroes, such hall-thanes, found! 
To the house the warrior walked apace, 
parted from peace;   the portal opended, 
though with forged bolts fast, when his fists had struck it, 
and baleful he burst in his blatant rage, 
the house's mouth. All hastily, then, 
o'er fair-paved floor the fiend trod on, 
ireful he strode; there streamed from his eyes 
fearful flashes, like flame to see. 
He spied in hall the hero-band, 
kin and clansmen clustered asleep, 
hardy liegemen. Then laughed his heart; 
for the monster was minded, ere morn should dawn, 
savage, to sever the soul of each, 
life from body, since lusty banquet 
waited his will! But Wyrd forbade him 
to seize any more of men on earth 
after that evening. Eagerly watched 
Hygelac's kinsman his cursed foe, 
how he would fare in fell attack. 
Not that the monster was minded to pause! 
Straightway he seized a sleeping warrior 
for the first, and tore him fiercely asunder, 
the bone-frame bit, drank blood in streams, 
swallowed him piecemeal: swiftly thus 
the lifeless corse was clear devoured, 
e'en feet and hands. Then farther he hied; 
for the hardy hero with hand he grasped, 
felt for the foe with fiendish claw, 
for the hero reclining, -- who clutched it boldly, 
prompt to answer, propped on his arm. 
Soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils 
that never he met in this middle-world, 
in the ways of earth, another wight 
with heavier hand-gripe; at heart he feared, 
sorrowed in soul, -- none the sooner escaped! 
Fain would he flee, his fastness seek, 
the den of devils: no doings now 
such as oft he had done in days of old! 
Then bethought him the hardy Hygelac-thane 
of his boast at evening: up he bounded, 
grasped firm his foe, whose fingers cracked. 
The fiend made off, but the earl close followed. 
The monster meant -- if he might at all -- 
to fling himself free, and far away 
fly to the fens, -- knew his fingers' power 
in the gripe of the grim one. Gruesome march 
to Heorot this monster of harm had made! 
Din filled the room; the Danes were bereft, 
castle-dwellers and clansmen all, 
earls, of their ale. Angry were both 
those savage hall-guards: the house resounded. 
Wonder it was the wine-hall firm 
in the strain of their struggle stood, to earth 
the fair house fell not; too fast it was 
within and without by its iron bands 
craftily clamped; though there crashed from sill 
many a mead-bench -- men have told me -- 
gay with gold, where the grim foes wrestled. 
So well had weened the wisest Scyldings 
that not ever at all might any man 
that bone-decked, brave house break asunder, 
crush by craft, -- unless clasp of fire 
in smoke engulfed it. -- Again uprose 
din redoubled. Danes of the North 
with fear and frenzy were filled, each one, 
who from the wall that wailing heard, 
God's foe sounding his grisly song, 
cry of the conquered, clamorous pain 
from captive of hell. Too closely held him 
he who of men in might was strongest 
in that same day of this our life. 
NOT in any wise would the earls'-defence    
suffer that slaughterous stranger to live, 
useless deeming his days and years 
to men on earth. Now many an earl 
of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral, 
fain the life of their lord to shield, 
their praised prince, if power were theirs; 
never they knew, -- as they neared the foe, 
hardy-hearted heroes of war, 
aiming their swords on every side 
the accursed to kill, -- no keenest blade, 
no farest of falchions fashioned on earth, 
could harm or hurt that hideous fiend! 
He was safe, by his spells, from sword of battle, 
from edge of iron. Yet his end and parting 
on that same day of this our life 
woful should be, and his wandering soul 
far off flit to the fiends' domain. 
Soon he found, who in former days, 
harmful in heart and hated of God, 
on many a man such murder wrought, 
that the frame of his body failed him now. 
For him the keen-souled kinsman of Hygelac 
held in hand; hateful alive 
was each to other. The outlaw dire 
took mortal hurt; a mighty wound 
showed on his shoulder, and sinews cracked, 
and the bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now 
the glory was given, and Grendel thence 
death-sick his den in the dark moor sought, 
noisome abode: he knew too well 
that here was the last of life, an end 
of his days on earth. -- To all the Danes 
by that bloody battle the boon had come. 
From ravage had rescued the roving stranger 
Hrothgar's hall; the hardy and wise one 
had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him, 
his deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes 
had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good, 
all their sorrow and ills assuaged, 
their bale of battle borne so long, 
and all the dole they erst endured 
pain a-plenty. -- Twas proof of this, 
when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down, 
arm and shoulder, -- all, indeed, 
of Grendel's gripe, -- neath the gabled roof' 
MANY at morning, as men have told me, 
warriors gathered the gift-hall round, 
folk-leaders faring from far and near, 
o'er wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view, 
trace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed 
the enemy's end to any man 
who saw by the gait of the graceless foe 
how the weary-hearted, away from thence, 
baffled in battle and banned, his steps 
death-marked dragged to the devils' mere. 
Bloody the billows were boiling there, 
turbid the tide of tumbling waves 
horribly seething, with sword-blood hot, 
by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor 
laid forlorn his life adown, 
his heathen soul,-and hell received it. 
Home then rode the hoary clansmen 
from that merry journey, and many a youth, 
on horses white, the hardy warriors, 
back from the mere. Then Beowulf's glory 
eager they echoed, and all averred 
that from sea to sea, or south or north, 
there was no other in earth's domain, 
under vault of heaven, more valiant found, 
of warriors none more worthy to rule! 
(On their lord beloved they laid no slight, 
gracious Hrothgar: a good king he!) 
From time to time, the tried-in-battle 
their gray steeds set to gallop amain, 
and ran a race when the road seemed fair. 
From time to time, a thane of the king, 
who had made many vaunts, and was mindful of verses, 
stored with sagas and songs of old, 
bound word to word in well-knit rime, 
welded his lay; this warrior soon 
of Beowulf's quest right cleverly sang, 
and artfully added an excellent tale, 
in well-ranged words, of the warlike deeds 
he had heard in saga of Sigemund. 
Strange the story: he said it all, -- 
the Waelsing's wanderings wide, his struggles, 
which never were told to tribes of men, 
the feuds and the frauds, save to Fitela only, 
when of these doings he deigned to speak, 
uncle to nephew; as ever the twain 
stood side by side in stress of war, 
and multitude of the monster kind 
they had felled with their swords. Of Sigemund grew, 
when he passed from life, no little praise; 
for the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed 
that herded the hoard:   under hoary rock 
the atheling dared the deed alone 
fearful quest, nor was Fitela there. 
Yet so it befell, his falchion pierced 
that wondrous worm, -- on the wall it struck, 
best blade; the dragon died in its blood. 
Thus had the dread-one by daring achieved 
over the ring-hoard to rule at will, 
himself to pleasure; a sea-boat he loaded, 
and bore on its bosom the beaming gold, 
son of Waels; the worm was consumed. 
He had of all heroes the highest renown 
among races of men, this refuge-of-warriors, 
for deeds of daring that decked his name 
since the hand and heart of Heremod 
grew slack in battle. He, swiftly banished 
to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes, 
to death was betrayed; for torrents of sorrow 
had lamed him too long; a load of care 
to earls and athelings all he proved. 
Oft indeed, in earlier days, 
for the warrior's wayfaring wise men mourned, 
who had hoped of him help from harm and bale, 
and had thought their sovran's son would thrive, 
follow his father, his folk protect, 
the hoard and the stronghold, heroes' land, 
home of Scyldings. -- But here, thanes said, 
the kinsman of Hygelac kinder seemed 
to all: the other   was urged to crime! 
And afresh to the race,   the fallow roads 
by swift steeds measured! The morning sun 
was climbing higher. Clansmen hastened 
to the high-built hall, those hardy-minded, 
the wonder to witness. Warden of treasure, 
crowned with glory, the king himself, 
with stately band from the bride-bower strode; 
and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens 
measured the path to the mead-house fair. 
HROTHGAR spake, -- to the hall he went, 
stood by the steps, the steep roof saw, 
garnished with gold, and Grendel's hand:-- 
"For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler 
be speedy thanks! A throng of sorrows 
I have borne from Grendel; but God still works 
wonder on wonder, the Warden-of-Glory. 
It was but now that I never more 
for woes that weighed on me waited help 
long as I lived, when, laved in blood, 
stood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house, -- 
widespread woe for wise men all, 
who had no hope to hinder ever 
foes infernal and fiendish sprites 
from havoc in hall. This hero now, 
by the Wielder's might, a work has done 
that not all of us erst could ever do 
by wile and wisdom. Lo, well can she say 
whoso of women this warrior bore 
among sons of men, if still she liveth, 
that the God of the ages was good to her 
in the birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee, 
of heroes best, I shall heartily love 
as mine own, my son; preserve thou ever 
this kinship new: thou shalt never lack 
wealth of the world that I wield as mine! 
Full oft for less have I largess showered, 
my precious hoard, on a punier man, 
less stout in struggle. Thyself hast now 
fulfilled such deeds, that thy fame shall endure 
through all the ages. As ever he did, 
well may the Wielder reward thee still! 
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:-- 
"This work of war most willingly 
we have fought, this fight, and fearlessly dared 
force of the foe. Fain, too, were I 
hadst thou but seen himself, what time 
the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall! 
Swiftly, I thought, in strongest gripe 
on his bed of death to bind him down, 
that he in the hent of this hand of mine 
should breathe his last: but he broke away. 
Him I might not -- the Maker willed not -- 
hinder from flight, and firm enough hold 
the life-destroyer: too sturdy was he, 
the ruthless, in running! For rescue, however, 
he left behind him his hand in pledge, 
arm and shoulder; nor aught of help 
could the cursed one thus procure at all. 
None the longer liveth he, loathsome fiend, 
sunk in his sins, but sorrow holds him 
tightly grasped in gripe of anguish, 
in baleful bonds, where bide he must, 
evil outlaw, such awful doom 
as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out. 
More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf    
in boastful speech of his battle-deeds, 
since athelings all, through the earl's great prowess, 
beheld that hand, on the high roof gazing, 
foeman's fingers, -- the forepart of each 
of the sturdy nails to steel was likest, -- 
heathen's "hand-spear, hostile warrior's 
claw uncanny. Twas clear, they said, 
that him no blade of the brave could touch, 
how keen soever, or cut away 
that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe. 
THERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now 
for hands to bedeck it, and dense was the throng 
of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse, 
the guest-room to garnish. Gold-gay shone the hangings 
that were wove on the wall, and wonders many 
to delight each mortal that looks upon them. 
Though braced within by iron bands, 
that building bright was broken sorely;    
rent were its hinges; the roof alone 
held safe and sound, when, seared with crime, 
the fiendish foe his flight essayed, 
of life despairing. -- No light thing that, 
the flight for safety, -- essay it who will! 
Forced of fate, he shall find his way 
to the refuge ready for race of man, 
for soul-possessors, and sons of earth; 
and there his body on bed of death 
shall rest after revel. Arrived was the hour 
when to hall proceeded Healfdene's son: 
the king himself would sit to banquet. 
Ne'er heard I of host in haughtier throng 
more graciously gathered round giver-of-rings! 
Bowed then to bench those bearers-of-glory, 
fain of the feasting. Featly received 
many a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit, 
kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall, 
Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot now 
was filled with friends; the folk of Scyldings 
ne'er yet had tried the traitor's deed. 
To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene 
a gold-wove banner, guerdon of triumph, 
broidered battle-flag, breastplate and helmet; 
and a splendid sword was seen of many 
borne to the brave one. Beowulf took 
cup in hall:   for such costly gifts 
he suffered no shame in that soldier throng. 
For I heard of few heroes, in heartier mood, 
with four such gifts, so fashioned with gold, 
on the ale-bench honoring others thus! 
O'er the roof of the helmet high, a ridge, 
wound with wires, kept ward o'er the head, 
lest the relict-of-files   should fierce invade, 
sharp in the strife, when that shielded hero 
should go to grapple against his foes. 
Then the earls'-defence   on the floor   bade lead 
coursers eight, with carven head-gear, 
adown the hall: one horse was decked 
with a saddle all shining and set in jewels; 
twas the battle-seat of the best of kings, 
when to play of swords the son of Healfdene 
was fain to fare. Ne'er failed his valor 
in the crush of combat when corpses fell. 
To Beowulf over them both then gave 
the refuge-of-Ingwines right and power, 
o'er war-steeds and weapons: wished him joy of them. 
Manfully thus the mighty prince, 
hoard-guard for heroes, that hard fight repaid 
with steeds and treasures contemned by none 
who is willing to say the sooth aright. 
AND the lord of earls, to each that came 
with Beowulf over the briny ways, 
an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave, 
precious gift; and the price   bade pay 
in gold for him whom Grendel erst 
murdered, -- and fain of them more had killed, 
had not wisest God their Wyrd averted, 
and the man's   brave mood. The Maker then 
ruled human kind, as here and now. 
Therefore is insight always best, 
and forethought of mind. How much awaits him 
of lief and of loath, who long time here, 
through days of warfare this world endures! 
Then song and music mingled sounds 
in the presence of Healfdene's head-of-armies    
and harping was heard with the hero-lay 
as Hrothgar's singer the hall-joy woke 
along the mead-seats, making his song 
of that sudden raid on the sons of Finn.    
Healfdene's hero, Hnaef the Scylding, 
was fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter.    
Hildeburh needed not hold in value 
her enemies' honor!   Innocent both 
were the loved ones she lost at the linden-play, 
bairn and brother, they bowed to fate, 
stricken by spears; twas a sorrowful woman! 
None doubted why the daughter of Hoc 
bewailed her doom when dawning came, 
and under the sky she saw them lying, 
kinsmen murdered, where most she had kenned 
of the sweets of the world! By war were swept, too, 
Finn's own liegemen, and few were left; 
in the parleying-place   he could ply no longer 
weapon, nor war could he wage on Hengest, 
and rescue his remnant by right of arms 
from the prince's thane. A pact he offered: 
another dwelling the Danes should have, 
hall and high-seat, and half the power 
should fall to them in Frisian land; 
and at the fee-gifts, Folcwald's son 
day by day the Danes should honor, 
the folk of Hengest favor with rings, 
even as truly, with treasure and jewels, 
with fretted gold, as his Frisian kin 
he meant to honor in ale-hall there. 
Pact of peace they plighted further 
on both sides firmly. Finn to Hengest 
with oath, upon honor, openly promised 
that woful remnant, with wise-men's aid, 
nobly to govern, so none of the guests 
by word or work should warp the treaty,    
or with malice of mind bemoan themselves 
as forced to follow their fee-giver's slayer, 
lordless men, as their lot ordained. 
Should Frisian, moreover, with foeman's taunt, 
that murderous hatred to mind recall, 
then edge of the sword must seal his doom. 
Oaths were given, and ancient gold 
heaped from hoard. -- The hardy Scylding, 
battle-thane best,   on his balefire lay. 
All on the pyre were plain to see 
the gory sark, the gilded swine-crest, 
boar of hard iron, and athelings many 
slain by the sword: at the slaughter they fell. 
It was Hildeburh's hest, at Hnaef's own pyre 
the bairn of her body on brands to lay, 
his bones to burn, on the balefire placed, 
at his uncle's side. In sorrowful dirges 
bewept them the woman: great wailing ascended. 
Then wound up to welkin the wildest of death-fires, 
roared o'er the hillock:   heads all were melted, 
gashes burst, and blood gushed out 
from bites   of the body. Balefire devoured, 
greediest spirit, those spared not by war 
out of either folk: their flower was gone. 
THEN hastened those heroes their home to see, 
friendless, to find the Frisian land, 
houses and high burg. Hengest still 
through the death-dyed winter dwelt with Finn, 
holding pact, yet of home he minded, 
though powerless his ring-decked prow to drive 
over the waters, now waves rolled fierce 
lashed by the winds, or winter locked them 
in icy fetters. Then fared another 
year to men's dwellings, as yet they do, 
the sunbright skies, that their season ever 
duly await. Far off winter was driven; 
fair lay earth's breast; and fain was the rover, 
the guest, to depart, though more gladly he pondered 
on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep, 
and how to hasten the hot encounter 
where sons of the Frisians were sure to be. 
So he escaped not the common doom, 
when Hun with "Lafing, the light-of-battle, 
best of blades, his bosom pierced: 
its edge was famed with the Frisian earls. 
On fierce-heart Finn there fell likewise, 
on himself at home, the horrid sword-death; 
for Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack 
had sorrowing told, from sea-ways landed, 
mourning their woes.   Finn's wavering spirit 
bode not in breast. The burg was reddened 
with blood of foemen, and Finn was slain, 
king amid clansmen; the queen was taken. 
To their ship the Scylding warriors bore 
all the chattels the chieftain owned, 
whatever they found in Finn's domain 
of gems and jewels. The gentle wife 
o'er paths of the deep to the Danes they bore, 
led to her land. The lay was finished, 
the gleeman's song. Then glad rose the revel; 
bench-joy brightened. Bearers draw 
from their "wonder-vats wine. Comes Wealhtheow forth, 
under gold-crown goes where the good pair sit, 
uncle and nephew, true each to the other one, 
kindred in amity. Unferth the spokesman 
at the Scylding lord's feet sat: men had faith in his spirit, 
his keenness of courage, though kinsmen had found him 
unsure at the sword-play. The Scylding queen spoke: 
"Quaff of this cup, my king and lord, 
breaker of rings, and blithe be thou, 
gold-friend of men; to the Geats here speak 
such words of mildness as man should use. 
Be glad with thy Geats; of those gifts be mindful, 
or near or far, which now thou hast. 
Men say to me, as son thou wishest 
yon hero to hold. Thy Heorot purged, 
jewel-hall brightest, enjoy while thou canst, 
with many a largess; and leave to thy kin 
folk and realm when forth thou goest 
to greet thy doom. For gracious I deem 
my Hrothulf,   willing to hold and rule 
nobly our youths, if thou yield up first, 
prince of Scyldings, thy part in the world. 
I ween with good he will well requite 
offspring of ours, when all he minds 
that for him we did in his helpless days 
of gift and grace to gain him honor! 
Then she turned to the seat where her sons were placed, 
Hrethric and Hrothmund, with heroes' bairns, 
young men together: the Geat, too, sat there, 
Beowulf brave, the brothers between. 
A CUP she gave him, with kindly greeting 
and winsome words. Of wounden gold, 
she offered, to honor him, arm-jewels twain, 
corselet and rings, and of collars the noblest 
that ever I knew the earth around. 
Ne'er heard I so mighty, neath heaven's dome, 
a hoard-gem of heroes, since Hama bore 
to his bright-built burg the Brisings' necklace, 
jewel and gem casket. -- Jealousy fled he, 
Eormenric's hate: chose help eternal. 
Hygelac Geat, grandson of Swerting, 
on the last of his raids this ring bore with him, 
under his banner the booty defending, 
the war-spoil warding; but Wyrd o'erwhelmed him 
what time, in his daring, dangers he sought, 
feud with Frisians. Fairest of gems 
he bore with him over the beaker-of-waves, 
sovran strong: under shield he died. 
Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks, 
gear of the breast, and that gorgeous ring; 
weaker warriors won the spoil, 
after gripe of battle, from Geatland's lord, 
and held the death-field. Din rose in hall. 
Wealhtheow spake amid warriors, and said:-- 
"This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth, 
Beowulf lov'd, these battle-weeds wear, 
a royal treasure, and richly thrive! 
Preserve thy strength, and these striplings here 
counsel in kindness: requital be mine. 
Hast done such deeds, that for days to come 
thou art famed among folk both far and near, 
so wide as washeth the wave of Ocean 
his windy walls. Through the ways of life 
prosper, O prince! I pray for thee 
rich possessions. To son of mine 
be helpful in deed and uphold his joys! 
Here every earl to the other is true, 
mild of mood, to the master loyal! 
Thanes are friendly, the throng obedient, 
liegemen are revelling: list and obey! 
Went then to her place. -- That was proudest of feasts; 
flowed wine for the warriors. Wyrd they knew not, 
destiny dire, and the doom to be seen 
by many an earl when eve should come, 
and Hrothgar homeward hasten away, 
royal, to rest. The room was guarded 
by an army of earls, as erst was done. 
They bared the bench-boards; abroad they spread 
beds and bolsters. -- One beer-carouser 
in danger of doom lay down in the hall. -- 
At their heads they set their shields of war, 
bucklers bright; on the bench were there 
over each atheling, easy to see, 
the high battle-helmet, the haughty spear, 
the corselet of rings. Twas their custom so 
ever to be for battle prepared, 
at home, or harrying, which it were, 
even as oft as evil threatened 
their sovran king. -- They were clansmen good. 
THEN sank they to sleep. With sorrow one bought 
his rest of the evening, -- as ofttime had happened 
when Grendel guarded that golden hall, 
evil wrought, till his end drew nigh, 
slaughter for sins. Twas seen and told 
how an avenger survived the fiend, 
as was learned afar. The livelong time 
after that grim fight, Grendel's mother, 
monster of women, mourned her woe. 
She was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters, 
cold sea-courses, since Cain cut down 
with edge of the sword his only brother, 
his father's offspring: outlawed he fled, 
marked with murder, from men's delights 
warded the wilds. -- There woke from him 
such fate-sent ghosts as Grendel, who, 
war-wolf horrid, at Heorot found 
a warrior watching and waiting the fray, 
with whom the grisly one grappled amain. 
But the man remembered his mighty power, 
the glorious gift that God had sent him, 
in his Maker's mercy put his trust 
for comfort and help: so he conquered the foe, 
felled the fiend, who fled abject, 
reft of joy, to the realms of death, 
mankind's foe. And his mother now, 
gloomy and grim, would go that quest 
of sorrow, the death of her son to avenge. 
To Heorot came she, where helmeted Danes 
slept in the hall. Too soon came back 
old ills of the earls, when in she burst, 
the mother of Grendel. Less grim, though, that terror, 
e'en as terror of woman in war is less, 
might of maid, than of men in arms 
when, hammer-forged, the falchion hard, 
sword gore-stained, through swine of the helm, 
crested, with keen blade carves amain. 
Then was in hall the hard-edge drawn, 
the swords on the settles,   and shields a-many 
firm held in hand: nor helmet minded 
nor harness of mail, whom that horror seized. 
Haste was hers; she would hie afar 
and save her life when the liegemen saw her. 
Yet a single atheling up she seized 
fast and firm, as she fled to the moor. 
He was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest, 
of trusty vassals betwixt the seas, 
whom she killed on his couch, a clansman famous, 
in battle brave. -- Nor was Beowulf there; 
another house had been held apart, 
after giving of gold, for the Geat renowned. -- 
Uproar filled Heorot; the hand all had viewed, 
blood-flecked, she bore with her; bale was returned, 
dole in the dwellings: twas dire exchange 
where Dane and Geat were doomed to give 
the lives of loved ones. Long-tried king, 
the hoary hero, at heart was sad 
when he knew his noble no more lived, 
and dead indeed was his dearest thane. 
To his bower was Beowulf brought in haste, 
dauntless victor. As daylight broke, 
along with his earls the atheling lord, 
with his clansmen, came where the king abode 
waiting to see if the Wielder-of-All 
would turn this tale of trouble and woe. 
Strode o'er floor the famed-in-strife, 
with his hand-companions, -- the hall resounded, -- 
wishing to greet the wise old king, 
Ingwines' lord; he asked if the night 
had passed in peace to the prince's mind. 
HROTHGAR spake, helmet-of-Scyldings:-- 
"Ask not of pleasure! Pain is renewed 
to Danish folk. Dead is Aeschere, 
of Yrmenlaf the elder brother, 
my sage adviser and stay in council, 
shoulder-comrade in stress of fight 
when warriors clashed and we warded our heads, 
hewed the helm-boars; hero famed 
should be every earl as Aeschere was! 
But here in Heorot a hand hath slain him 
of wandering death-sprite. I wot not whither,    
proud of the prey, her path she took, 
fain of her fill. The feud she avenged 
that yesternight, unyieldingly, 
Grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst, -- 
seeing how long these liegemen mine 
he ruined and ravaged. Reft of life, 
in arms he fell. Now another comes, 
keen and cruel, her kin to avenge, 
faring far in feud of blood 
so that many a thane shall think, who e'er 
sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings, 
this is hardest of heart-bales. The hand lies low 
that once was willing each wish to please. 
Land-dwellers here   and liegemen mine, 
who house by those parts, I have heard relate 
that such a pair they have sometimes seen, 
march-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting, 
wandering spirits: one of them seemed, 
so far as my folk could fairly judge, 
of womankind; and one, accursed, 
in man's guise trod the misery-track 
of exile, though huger than human bulk. 
Grendel in days long gone they named him, 
folk of the land; his father they knew not, 
nor any brood that was born to him 
of treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home; 
by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands, 
fenways fearful, where flows the stream 
from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks, 
underground flood. Not far is it hence 
in measure of miles that the mere expands, 
and o'er it the frost-bound forest hanging, 
sturdily rooted, shadows the wave. 
By night is a wonder weird to see, 
fire on the waters. So wise lived none 
of the sons of men, to search those depths! 
Nay, though the heath-rover, harried by dogs, 
the horn-proud hart, this holt should seek, 
long distance driven, his dear life first 
on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge 
to hide his head: tis no happy place! 
Thence the welter of waters washes up 
wan to welkin when winds bestir 
evil storms, and air grows dusk, 
and the heavens weep. Now is help once more 
with thee alone! The land thou knowst not, 
place of fear, where thou findest out 
that sin-flecked being. Seek if thou dare! 
I will reward thee, for waging this fight, 
with ancient treasure, as erst I did, 
with winding gold, if thou winnest back. 
BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: 
"Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us better 
friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them. 
Each of us all must his end abide 
in the ways of the world; so win who may 
glory ere death! When his days are told, 
that is the warrior's worthiest doom. 
Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon, 
and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel. 
No harbor shall hide her -- heed my promise! -- 
enfolding of field or forested mountain 
or floor of the flood, let her flee where she will! 
But thou this day endure in patience, 
as I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one. 
Leaped up the graybeard: God he thanked, 
mighty Lord, for the man's brave words. 
For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled 
wave-maned steed. The sovran wise 
stately rode on; his shield-armed men 
followed in force. The footprints led 
along the woodland, widely seen, 
a path o'er the plain, where she passed, and trod 
the murky moor; of men-at-arms 
she bore the bravest and best one, dead, 
him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled. 
On then went the atheling-born 
o'er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles, 
narrow passes and unknown ways, 
headlands sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors. 
Foremost he   fared, a few at his side 
of the wiser men, the ways to scan, 
till he found in a flash the forested hill 
hanging over the hoary rock, 
a woful wood: the waves below 
were dyed in blood. The Danish men 
had sorrow of soul, and for Scyldings all, 
for many a hero, twas hard to bear, 
ill for earls, when Aeschere's head 
they found by the flood on the foreland there. 
Waves were welling, the warriors saw, 
hot with blood; but the horn sang oft 
battle-song bold. The band sat down, 
and watched on the water worm-like things, 
sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep, 
and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness -- 
such as oft essay at hour of morn 
on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest, -- 
and sea-snakes and monsters. These started away, 
swollen and savage that song to hear, 
that war-horn's blast. The warden of Geats, 
with bolt from bow, then balked of life, 
of wave-work, one monster, amid its heart 
went the keen war-shaft; in water it seemed 
less doughty in swimming whom death had seized. 
Swift on the billows, with boar-spears well 
hooked and barbed, it was hard beset, 
done to death and dragged on the headland, 
wave-roamer wondrous. Warriors viewed 
the grisly guest. Then girt him Beowulf 
in martial mail, nor mourned for his life. 
His breastplate broad and bright of hues, 
woven by hand, should the waters try; 
well could it ward the warrior's body 
that battle should break on his breast in vain 
nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe. 
And the helmet white that his head protected 
was destined to dare the deeps of the flood, 
through wave-whirl win: twas wound with chains, 
decked with gold, as in days of yore 
the weapon-smith worked it wondrously, 
with swine-forms set it, that swords nowise, 
brandished in battle, could bite that helm. 
Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps 
which Hrothgar's orator offered at need: 
"Hrunting they named the hilted sword, 
of old-time heirlooms easily first; 
iron was its edge, all etched with poison, 
with battle-blood hardened, nor blenched it at fight 
in hero's hand who held it ever, 
on paths of peril prepared to go 
to folkstead   of foes. Not first time this 
it was destined to do a daring task. 
For he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf 
sturdy and strong, that speech he had made, 
drunk with wine, now this weapon he lent 
to a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not 
under welter of waters wager his life 
as loyal liegeman. So lost he his glory, 
honor of earls. With the other not so, 
who girded him now for the grim encounter. 
BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:-- 
"Have mind, thou honored offspring of Healfdene 
gold-friend of men, now I go on this quest, 
sovran wise, what once was said: 
if in thy cause it came that I 
should lose my life, thou wouldst loyal bide 
to me, though fallen, in father's place! 
Be guardian, thou, to this group of my thanes, 
my warrior-friends, if War should seize me; 
and the goodly gifts thou gavest me, 
Hrothgar beloved, to Hygelac send! 
Geatland's king may ken by the gold, 
Hrethel's son see, when he stares at the treasure, 
that I got me a friend for goodness famed, 
and joyed while I could in my jewel-bestower. 
And let Unferth wield this wondrous sword, 
earl far-honored, this heirloom precious, 
hard of edge: with Hrunting I 
seek doom of glory, or Death shall take me. 
After these words the Weder-Geat lord 
boldly hastened, biding never 
answer at all: the ocean floods 
closed o'er the hero. Long while of the day 
fled ere he felt the floor of the sea. 
Soon found the fiend who the flood-domain 
sword-hungry held these hundred winters, 
greedy and grim, that some guest from above, 
some man, was raiding her monster-realm. 
She grasped out for him with grisly claws, 
and the warrior seized; yet scathed she not 
his body hale; the breastplate hindered, 
as she strove to shatter the sark of war, 
the linked harness, with loathsome hand. 
Then bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched, 
the lord of rings to the lair she haunted 
whiles vainly he strove, though his valor held, 
weapon to wield against wondrous monsters 
that sore beset him; sea-beasts many 
tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail, 
and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked 
he was now in some hall, he knew not which, 
where water never could work him harm, 
nor through the roof could reach him ever 
fangs of the flood. Firelight he saw, 
beams of a blaze that brightly shone. 
Then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep, 
mere-wife monstrous. For mighty stroke 
he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not. 
Then sang on her head that seemly blade 
its war-song wild. But the warrior found 
the light-of-battle   was loath to bite, 
to harm the heart: its hard edge failed 
the noble at need, yet had known of old 
strife hand to hand, and had helmets cloven, 
doomed men's fighting-gear. First time, this, 
for the gleaming blade that its glory fell. 
Firm still stood, nor failed in valor, 
heedful of high deeds, Hygelac's kinsman; 
flung away fretted sword, featly jewelled, 
the angry earl; on earth it lay 
steel-edged and stiff. His strength he trusted, 
hand-gripe of might. So man shall do 
whenever in war he weens to earn him 
lasting fame, nor fears for his life! 
Seized then by shoulder, shrank not from combat, 
the Geatish war-prince Grendel's mother. 
Flung then the fierce one, filled with wrath, 
his deadly foe, that she fell to ground. 
Swift on her part she paid him back 
with grisly grasp, and grappled with him. 
Spent with struggle, stumbled the warrior, 
fiercest of fighting-men, fell adown. 
On the hall-guest she hurled herself, hent her short sword, 
broad and brown-edged,   the bairn to avenge, 
the sole-born son. -- On his shoulder lay 
braided breast-mail, barring death, 
withstanding entrance of edge or blade. 
Life would have ended for Ecgtheow's son, 
under wide earth for that earl of Geats, 
had his armor of war not aided him, 
battle-net hard, and holy God 
wielded the victory, wisest Maker. 
The Lord of Heaven allowed his cause; 
and easily rose the earl erect. 
MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant, 
old-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof, 
warriors' heirloom, weapon unmatched, 
-- save only twas more than other men 
to bandy-of-battle could bear at all -- 
as the giants had wrought it, ready and keen. 
Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings' chieftain, 
bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword, 
reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote 
that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard, 
her bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced through 
that fated-one's flesh: to floor she sank. 
Bloody the blade: he was blithe of his deed. 
Then blazed forth light. Twas bright within 
as when from the sky there shines unclouded 
heaven's candle. The hall he scanned. 
By the wall then went he; his weapon raised 
high by its hilts the Hygelac-thane, 
angry and eager. That edge was not useless 
to the warrior now. He wished with speed 
Grendel to guerdon for grim raids many, 
for the war he waged on Western-Danes 
oftener far than an only time, 
when of Hrothgar's hearth-companions 
he slew in slumber, in sleep devoured, 
fifteen men of the folk of Danes, 
and as many others outward bore, 
his horrible prey. Well paid for that 
the wrathful prince! For now prone he saw 
Grendel stretched there, spent with war, 
spoiled of life, so scathed had left him 
Heorot's battle. The body sprang far 
when after death it endured the blow, 
sword-stroke savage, that severed its head. 
Soon,   then, saw the sage companions 
who waited with Hrothgar, watching the flood, 
that the tossing waters turbid grew, 
blood-stained the mere. Old men together, 
hoary-haired, of the hero spake; 
the warrior would not, they weened, again, 
proud of conquest, come to seek 
their mighty master. To many it seemed 
the wolf-of-the-waves had won his life. 
The ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings 
left the headland; homeward went 
the gold-friend of men.   But the guests sat on, 
stared at the surges, sick in heart, 
and wished, yet weened not, their winsome lord 
again to see. Now that sword began, 
from blood of the fight, in battle-droppings,    
war-blade, to wane: twas a wondrous thing 
that all of it melted as ice is wont 
when frosty fetters the Father loosens, 
unwinds the wave-bonds, wielding all 
seasons and times: the true God he! 
Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats 
precious things, though a plenty he saw, 
save only the head and that hilt withal 
blazoned with jewels: the blade had melted, 
burned was the bright sword, her blood was so hot, 
so poisoned the hell-sprite who perished within there. 
Soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat 
downfall of demons; up-dove through the flood. 
The clashing waters were cleansed now, 
waste of waves, where the wandering fiend 
her life-days left and this lapsing world. 
Swam then to strand the sailors'-refuge, 
sturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty glad, 
of burden brave he bore with him. 
Went then to greet him, and God they thanked, 
the thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe, 
that safe and sound they could see him again. 
Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor 
deftly they doffed: now drowsed the mere, 
water neath welkin, with war-blood stained. 
Forth they fared by the footpaths thence, 
merry at heart the highways measured, 
well-known roads. Courageous men 
carried the head from the cliff by the sea, 
an arduous task for all the band, 
the firm in fight, since four were needed 
on the shaft-of-slaughter   strenuously 
to bear to the gold-hall Grendel's head. 
So presently to the palace there 
foemen fearless, fourteen Geats, 
marching came. Their master-of-clan 
mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod. 
Strode then within the sovran thane 
fearless in fight, of fame renowned, 
hardy hero, Hrothgar to greet. 
And next by the hair into hall was borne 
Grendel's head, where the henchmen were drinking, 
an awe to clan and queen alike, 
a monster of marvel: the men looked on. 
BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:-- 
"Lo, now, this sea-booty, son of Healfdene, 
Lord of Scyldings, we've lustily brought thee, 
sign of glory; thou seest it here. 
Not lightly did I with my life escape! 
In war under water this work I essayed 
with endless effort; and even so 
my strength had been lost had the Lord not shielded me. 
Not a whit could I with Hrunting do 
in work of war, though the weapon is good; 
yet a sword the Sovran of Men vouchsafed me 
to spy on the wall there, in splendor hanging, 
old, gigantic, -- how oft He guides 
the friendless wight! -- and I fought with that brand, 
felling in fight, since fate was with me, 
the house's wardens. That war-sword then 
all burned, bright blade, when the blood gushed o'er it, 
battle-sweat hot; but the hilt I brought back 
from my foes. So avenged I their fiendish deeds 
death-fall of Danes, as was due and right. 
And this is my hest, that in Heorot now 
safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band, 
and every thane of all thy folk 
both old and young; no evil fear, 
Scyldings' lord, from that side again, 
aught ill for thy earls, as erst thou must! 
Then the golden hilt, for that gray-haired leader, 
hoary hero, in hand was laid, 
giant-wrought, old. So owned and enjoyed it 
after downfall of devils, the Danish lord, 
wonder-smiths' work, since the world was rid 
of that grim-souled fiend, the foe of God, 
murder-marked, and his mother as well. 
Now it passed into power of the people's king, 
best of all that the oceans bound 
who have scattered their gold o'er Scandia's isle. 
Hrothgar spake -- the hilt he viewed, 
heirloom old, where was etched the rise 
of that far-off fight when the floods o'erwhelmed, 
raging waves, the race of giants 
(fearful their fate!), a folk estranged 
from God Eternal: whence guerdon due 
in that waste of waters the Wielder paid them. 
So on the guard of shining gold 
in runic staves it was rightly said 
for whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought, 
best of blades, in bygone days, 
and the hilt well wound. -- The wise-one spake, 
son of Healfdene; silent were all:-- 
"Lo, so may he say who sooth and right 
follows mid folk, of far times mindful, 
a land-warden old,   that this earl belongs 
to the better breed! So, borne aloft, 
thy fame must fly, O friend my Beowulf, 
far and wide o'er folksteads many. Firmly thou shalt all maintain, 
mighty strength with mood of wisdom. Love of mine will I assure thee, 
as, awhile ago, I promised; thou shalt prove a stay in future, 
in far-off years, to folk of thine, 
to the heroes a help. Was not Heremod thus 
to offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings, 
nor grew for their grace, but for grisly slaughter, 
for doom of death to the Danishmen. 
He slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades, 
companions at board! So he passed alone, 
chieftain haughty, from human cheer. 
Though him the Maker with might endowed, 
delights of power, and uplifted high 
above all men, yet blood-fierce his mind, 
his breast-hoard, grew, no bracelets gave he 
to Danes as was due; he endured all joyless 
strain of struggle and stress of woe, 
long feud with his folk. Here find thy lesson! 
Of virtue advise thee! This verse I have said for thee, 
wise from lapsed winters. Wondrous seems 
how to sons of men Almighty God 
in the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom, 
estate, high station: He swayeth all things. 
Whiles He letteth right lustily fare 
the heart of the hero of high-born race, -- 
in seat ancestral assigns him bliss, 
his folk's sure fortress in fee to hold, 
puts in his power great parts of the earth, 
empire so ample, that end of it 
this wanter-of-wisdom weeneth none. 
So he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm him 
illness or age; no evil cares 
shadow his spirit; no sword-hate threatens 
from ever an enemy: all the world 
wends at his will, no worse he knoweth, 
till all within him obstinate pride 
waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers, 
the spirit's sentry; sleep is too fast 
which masters his might, and the murderer nears, 
stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow! 
"UNDER harness his heart then is hit indeed 
by sharpest shafts; and no shelter avails 
from foul behest of the hellish fiend.    
Him seems too little what long he possessed. 
Greedy and grim, no golden rings 
he gives for his pride; the promised future 
forgets he and spurns, with all God has sent him, 
Wonder-Wielder, of wealth and fame. 
Yet in the end it ever comes 
that the frame of the body fragile yields, 
fated falls; and there follows another 
who joyously the jewels divides, 
the royal riches, nor recks of his forebear. 
Ban, then, such baleful thoughts, Beowulf dearest, 
best of men, and the better part choose, 
profit eternal; and temper thy pride, 
warrior famous! The flower of thy might 
lasts now a while: but erelong it shall be 
that sickness or sword thy strength shall minish, 
or fang of fire, or flooding billow, 
or bite of blade, or brandished spear, 
or odious age; or the eyes' clear beam 
wax dull and darken: Death even thee 
in haste shall o'erwhelm, thou hero of war! 
So the Ring-Danes these half-years a hundred I ruled, 
wielded neath welkin, and warded them bravely 
from mighty-ones many o'er middle-earth, 
from spear and sword, till it seemed for me 
no foe could be found under fold of the sky. 
Lo, sudden the shift! To me seated secure 
came grief for joy when Grendel began 
to harry my home, the hellish foe; 
for those ruthless raids, unresting I suffered 
heart-sorrow heavy. Heaven be thanked, 
Lord Eternal, for life extended 
that I on this head all hewn and bloody, 
after long evil, with eyes may gaze! 
-- Go to the bench now! Be glad at banquet, 
warrior worthy! A wealth of treasure 
at dawn of day, be dealt between us! 
Glad was the Geats' lord, going betimes 
to seek his seat, as the Sage commanded. 
Afresh, as before, for the famed-in-battle, 
for the band of the hall, was a banquet dight 
nobly anew. The Night-Helm darkened 
dusk o'er the drinkers. The doughty ones rose: 
for the hoary-headed would hasten to rest, 
aged Scylding; and eager the Geat, 
shield-fighter sturdy, for sleeping yearned. 
Him wander-weary, warrior-guest 
from far, a hall-thane heralded forth, 
who by custom courtly cared for all 
needs of a thane as in those old days 
warrior-wanderers wont to have. 
So slumbered the stout-heart. Stately the hall 
rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on 
till a raven black the rapture-of-heaven    
blithe-heart boded. Bright came flying 
shine after shadow. The swordsmen hastened, 
athelings all were eager homeward 





Elegance
 

All that is uncared for. 
Left alone in the stillness 
in that pure silence married 
to the stillness of nature. 
A door off its hinges, 
shade and shadows in an empty room. 
Leaks for light. Raw where 
the tin roof rusted through. 
The rustle of weeds in their 
different kinds of air in the mornings, 
year after year. 
A pecan tree, and the house 
made out of mud bricks. Accurate 
and unexpected beauty, rattling 
and singing. If not to the sun, 
then to nothing and to no one.





New Stanzas for Amazing Grace
 

I dreamed I dwelled in a homeless place 
Where I was lost alone 
Folk looked right through me into space 
And passed with eyes of stone 

O homeless hand on many a street 
Accept this change from me 
A friendly smile or word is sweet 
As fearless charity 

Woe workingman who hears the cry 
And cannot spare a dime 
Nor look into a homeless eye 
Afraid to give the time 

So rich or poor no gold to talk 
A smile on your face 
The homeless ones where you may walk 
Receive amazing grace 

I dreamed I dwelled in a homeless place 
Where I was lost alone 
Folk looked right through me into space 
And passed with eyes of stone

Where Are The Stars Pristine
 

Everyone's spending Christmas Eve adrift 
in the corporal skirmish, mixing 
up the darks with the lights, fending 
with elbows and dirty 
looks. Wet wool and down 
crowd the air. Where are the stars, pristine 
as great ideas? Behind clouds 
the heavens saturate 
with luminous dust, shuttles wearing halos 
of earthdirt, light pollution 
from jets fired to keep things 
on course. Boys rickrack a ball off 
floor and ceiling past the table 
tree bubbling with giveaway 
ornaments from Burger King and lights 
that manage an occasional 
lackadaisical flash. Showstoppers: everyone 

looks every time and keeps looking 
to make sure it happened. 
The double frontloaders are going 
like abstract TVs. And the program is important: 
all about the boggling sullied 
lives we'd like to hide. 
But this is no place 
to do so, where known 
and unknown perverts come 
to pirate underpants and the innocent 
clutch their Cheer and Shout. 
The rules are posted: only the toughest 
habiliments, the superego 
of raiment can take such agitation. 
And only the poor are invited to endure 
the sneezy powders and clean resentment. 

Imagine a museum installation-- 
200 hypnotic washers stuffed with somersaulting 
cloth. Critics could rise to the challenge, 
their statements settling like coats 
of gold and silver 
chain mail over each machine: 
"These Speed Queen pieces thrust ahead of art- 
for-art's sake to confront us 
with a realism of socio-political 
magnitude. The vortex-like movement 
of pattern, color, and texture infuses 
these works with an abundance of unconscious 
bliss. The soft forms 
circulate with vigor 
across the screens. The viewer 
is not privy 
to the cause of dirt 
though one is witness to the dirt's 
ablutions. The point is 
we are not impeccable." 

Everyone would be happy 
to know that! And so we're forced to 
scoop and pour 
a fine white empathy over 
the hairy flannels, snaggy nylons, 
the glass front that gives 
forth this light 
industry, the silly tree 
and jingles about blue and white 
Christmases, chestnuts, sleighbells, 
just as snow settles 
on every unsequestered thing: 

from blistered gum - 
ball machines, clumsy bumpers, 
crepuscular theaters with sticky floors, 
to ramshackle mansions 
choked with smiling 
china animals where light shakes itself out 
from TVs and old women 
frail as walking sticks 
sweep their stoops at eight a.m. 
Just as snow makes the less than impeccable 
classical, stroking the merely 
drab or passing, quickly or slowly, 
so we can count only on its 
leaving, teaching 
liquidity 
to what seems solid.





[Two poems]
 

evening the priest 

let three rivers flow 
and a woman sing to her child 








I am afraid a woman 
Will burn my hair 






Crest
 

I   Or Your Woman 

The night was a bad one. 
I only saw one other person out: 
A big black man on muleback 
Riding along the levee, marking the water. 

There was a lantern in his hand 
And what you could call a grim smile on the lips. 
I shifted down gears, 
Rolled down the window, turned the radio low. 

And said, "Say there, man, how goes it? 
But he couldn't hear me for the rain 
And the song on his transistor radio. 
"I don't know, he said, "but it's raining, 

Raining to beat hell. 
Said I, "Do you think it's going to quit? 
"Friend, I couldn't tell you. 
When big water will, you call everyman friend . . . 

We said our goodnights, 
Went on, by mule and flatbed truck, wearing black 
Rubber, cold to the bone, 
Like divers from different ships meeting below. 

All you can do is nod, some of the times. 
At least, we spoke, knowing that living 
Anywhere near the river 
You speak when you can; the only thing you try 

To hold is your liquor, 
And we had none, that bad night on the levee. 
Always down the road, I looked up 
In the mirror.  And I'm sure he'd a done the same. 


II   Midnight 

I almost slid off, once 
Imagining this cloud was a pall 
And the moon was a body. 
I don't know who put coins over her eyes. 

When I got to Rampion's Ferry, 
I thought I was the only one there. 
I mean it was quiet, 
Except for the current, the cables, and the rain. 

I got a piece of rope 
Out of the back of my truck, and wound it 
Around the generator 
Engine; it kicked right off the first pull. 

The yellow bug lights came on, 
And I saw a body move under a purple blanket. 
He cussed me out 
For waking him up, pulling his old self up. 

There was some kind of fish 
In the weave of his poncho; other figures 
Of snakes and birds, too. 
I didn't mean to wake the awnry fellow up, 

I wonder if I did. 
A strange odor came from underneath him 
When he dragged out his towsack. 
It didn't smell of something burning, but of 

Something that was singed. 
Like the rain, it didn't let up. 
"Are we going crosst it, or not, 
He told me in a voice, half-blooded song. 


III   Some Past Twelve 

Someone with a light 
Rode up before I could see what all 
He was pulling from the burlap:   
Blue calling chalk you find in pool halls, ivory 

Tusks, a stringer with rotten heads 
The good book and another I couldn't pronounce-- 
Just as worn, 
And one of those paperweight crystals that snows. 

He had strummed the mandolin twice, 
A couple of sounds blue as a fox in trouble 
In a snowdrift on a ridge, like weeds 
Burning underwater, a few licks of silent fire. 

When I recognized the lookout 
The ferry wasn't more than a few feet off the bank, 
So the mule made it aboard, easy; 
Its hooves on the planks like a mad, rough carpenter 

Nailing driftwood together. 
Oh, we made it across.  We didn't exactly 
Hit the dock on the head, 
But we floated on down to Vahalia's Landing. 

We had a good time. 
The foreigner played the mandolin, the river 
Reached its crest, 
And the man on the mule and I drank way into the morning. 

They heard us, the ones on land. 
"We're a floating whorehouse, without noun women. 
And in the dead of night, 
Rain and all, we motioned them on.





Light Blue
 

The white clothes on the line put the man to sleep. 
He was sitting on a soda case 
Leaning back on the porch. 

He rolled down his sleeves with his eyes shut. 
He could feel the sun going into the trees. 

He wanted to catch the evening ferry 
And meet someone across the river. 

He dreamed about her 
Putting polish on her nails. 
He was in the woods and many women 
Were walking around him in a circle. 
He thought about crosses in their blood. 

As it got to be night he could feel the heat in his face. 
He was going to open his eyes. 
And look up at the moon. 
It was like the light blue handkerchief 
She gave him to go with his dark suit. 

That's when he felt the hot salt all over him 
Like broken glass. 
He was afraid to open his eyes. 
He wondered if he could use any words on it. 
But the big woman in the black dress 
Was already in the backseat of the car 
Rolling the window up with one hand 
And making a sign on him with the other. 

She was in the car, too. 
He saw her biting her nails when they pulled away. 

There was a dead snake on his shoes. 
He knew there would be a circle 
Of little beating hearts in his bed, 
And before he could get home 
They would be dry and still.

Pits
 

We go on and we tremble. 
God says we can screw now. 
God says to give up all your lovers, 
Time to die. 

When I was younger I drove a Lincoln. 
God said to trade it in. 
A tad lovely, then, and terrible, 
And sick of my own kind, 
I wanted to become a woman. 
I wanted to wash the feet of other women 
In public, I wanted his eyes 
On me, olives on the ground. 

I gave you my hand, 
Now I go around with my sleeve 
Tucked in my coat. 

I climb no trees, touch 
One breast at a time, 
Hold no hands myself. 

I go on and I tremble 
With your back in my blood, 
The clap my mother left me. 

With me no more, and now, 
And forever, and even always 
The dust of my feet 
In the desert 
I give you stranger my sign, 
My peace, 
But God you remember 
You fucked me out of my hand.





Riverlight
 

My father and I lie down together. 
He is dead. 

We look up at the stars, the steady sound 
Of the wind turning the night like a ceiling fan. 
This is our home. 

I remember the work in him 
Like bitterness in persimmons before a frost. 
And I imagine the way he had fear, 
The ground turning dark in a rain. 

Now he gets up. 

And I dream he looks down in my eyes 
And watches me die.





Friend of the Enemy
 

The yolk went down my leg 
Like a beautiful snail without a shell, 
Went down the hill 
To the skillet of water, to the nymphflies, 
Into the lips of pond minnows, 
Down the long belly of the gar  the hellbenders 
Having dived and lost, then into 
The paw of the lame panther 
Who loped back to her lair with it. 
As for the white, it stayed with me, 
Mark of the beast, birth, and trade.





The Arkansas Prison System
 

Is like a lyric poem 
with seven basic themes 
first the cottonpicker 
dragging behind it a wagon of testicles 
a pair of pliers which can fill in 
for a cross in a pinch 
then there is the warm pond 
between the maiden's thighs 
next we have some friends 
of yours and mine 
who shall be with us always 
Pablo the artist 
the pubis of the moon 
Pablo the cellist 
panther of silence 
Pablo the poet 
the point of no return 
and in case of emergency 
the seventh and final theme 
of this systematic poem 
is the systematic way 
death undresses in front of you





Flies on Shit
 

To the gentlemen from the south   
to the tourists from the north 
who write poems about the south   
to the dumb-ass students 
I'd like to ask one lousy question 
have you ever seen a regatta of flies 
sail around a pile of shit 
and then come back and picnic on the shit 
just once in your life have you heard 
flies on shit 
because I cut my eye teeth on flies 
floating in shit





The Truth
 

Nicanor Parra
I'm not going to lie 
Through my teeth to you 
Like the poets from Minnesota, 
The South, and the West, 
And New York City. 

Most of all in life 
I would like to fuck a thirteen-year-old again, 
And I don't have any hesitations 
About saying I'd rather be Marlon Brando 
Than I would T. S. Eliot, etc. 

I have more respect for Muhammad Ali 
Than any other living man. 
Of course I've tried Esquire, 
But my shoes aren't platforms 
And I don't know shit about canoes. 

Although I can't prove it, 
Most poets work for the highway dept. 
There are more of them than there are 
Flies and engineers. 
And I stink like a dead mule under an overpass.





Dead Orchard
 

Raymond Radiguet
Like seven birds sleeping on the plateau 
Overlooking the shipwreck of love, mystery 
Of the drunken visitors wandering off 
With your wife, men who talk with a bad accent, 
The condemned the abandoned, one day of silence, 
Two days of silence, dreams shattered and protected, 
The more the blossoms the more you suffer.





Wanted
 

Luis Buuel
A white bull, a cassock, an antique mirror 
The famous ones have passed hours in front of, 
A midnight blue tuxedo, a fainting couch, a key 
To a box of lewd photographs, a swastika, 
Twelve bales of hay, three grave plots, a statue 
Of Christ holding a heart pierced by a dagger, 
A black patch, all kinds of utensils for the sick-- 
Including thirty-nine feet of catheter tubing, 
A houseboat, a dog, a baby grand, an oar 
Said to have been carved from a lovely river 
And a woman's hat by Alfred Jarry, a mattress, 
A shotgun, a diving helmet, an essay on The Art 
Of Taxidermy and a clitoris mounted on a ring 
Like quartz, a crescent wrench, a bulldozer.   





Play in Which Darkness Falls
 

Raymond Roussel
Two girls runaway from the Home.  They have a revolver 
in their possession.  The Sisters Of Our Lady have given up 
looking for them, returning in the night with soft candles. 
The sleek clouds have thrown their riders, and the bees 
are returning to the honey, the clover at the edge of the   
cliff black as eyelids, damp as blue mussels flexing at the moon. 
The girls look in the stolen mirror, then throw their shoes 
in the sea.  They take off one another's dress, posing 
on the rocks that jut out over the faded water of the last days. 
The clover beat down from their splendid feet, the clover 
quiet like a vault.  Nearby in a ship named for early death, 
I drink wine like a city.  Anchored far off the continent of love.   
Strange, but bees do not die in their own honey, and how the dead 
are toted off, how the sweet moons are deposited in the catacombs. 
The clover at the edge of the sea like a chemise, place 
where animals have lain.  They help one another with their hair, 
their dresses blowing back to land.  They look over the 
cliff, spit on the beach.  Birds I have never seen going by.





In Another Room I Am Drinking Eggs from a Boot
 

Hans Richter
What if the moon was essence of quinine 
And high heels were a time of day 
When certain birds bled 
The chauffeur is telling the cook 
The antler would pry into ice floes 
Swim with a lamp 
And we'd be shivering in a ditch 
Biting through a black wing 
There would be boats 
There would be a dream country 
The great quiet humming of the soul at night 
The only sound is a shovel 
Clearing a place for a mailbox





Living
 

I had my quiet time early in the morning 
Eating Almond Joys with Mother. 
We'd sit on the back porch and talk to God. 
We really had a good time. 

Later on, 
I'd sort baseball cards 
Or look for bottles. 
In the afternoon I'd shoot blackbirds. 

Jimmy would go by the house for ice water 
And make the truck backfire. 
Oh, I really liked that. 
That was the reason he did it. 

In the evening the cottontails ran across the groves. 
I shot one and put him in the backseat. 
He went to the bathroom. 
Jimmy said I knocked the shit out of him. 

At night we would listen to the ballgame. 
Then to the Hoss Man. 
Jimmy liked "Take Out Some Insurance On Me Baby   
    by Jimmy Reed.





The Pump
 

There was always a lizard 
Or a frog around the pump, 
Waiting for a little extra water 
Or a butterfly to light. 

Jimmy said the pump gave him the worms. 
I got the worms under the slick boards. 
The pump would bite you in the winter. 
It got hold of Jimmy and wouldn't let go. 

The blades of Johnson grass were tall 
And sharp around the pump stand. 
I had to hoe them all the time 
Nobody filled the prime jar, though. 

One time, I cut the tongue 
Out of a Buster Brown shoe 
And gave it to the pump. 
It made a good sucker washer. 

Sometimes the pump seemed like Jesus. 
I liked bathing buck naked 
Under the pump, 
Not in a goddamn washtub.





Poem
 

When the rain hits the snake in the head, 
he closes his eyes and wishes he were 
asleep in a tire on the side of the road, 
so young boys could roll him over, forever.





Transcendence of Janus
 

I am not asleep, but I see 
a limb, the fingers of death, the ghost 
of an anonymous painter 
leaving the prints of death 
on the wall; the bright feathers 
of soft birds blowing 
away in the forest; 
the bones of fish and 
the white backs of strange women; 
your breathing 
like the slow thunder 
on the other side of some river 
as you sleep beside me; old 
dancing teachers weeping in their offices; 
toads with bellies as quiet 
as girls asleep in mansions, dreaming 
of saddles and pulling the sheets 
between their legs; fireflies 
going to sleep on moonseed flowers 
around a plantation gazebo at dawn; 
a girl sweating in bed; hawks drifting 
through the moon; a woman's hair, 
the flavor of death, floating 
in the fog like a flag 
on a ship full of ghosts, 
the ghosts of soldiers 
searching for the graves of their mothers; june bugs 
listening to Leoncavallo; 
christ weeping on Coney Island, 
inevitable, like a fissure 
in a faggot's ass; a widower 
with no sons, a lonesome janitor, 
a worm in the sun, the dusty sockets 
of poets, who have lost their eyes, their





Planning the Disappearance of Those Who Have Gone
 

Soon I will make my appearance 
But first I must take off my rings 
And swords and lay them out all 
Along the lupine banks of the forbidden river 
In reckoning the days I have 
Left on this earth I will use 
No fingers





The Intruder
 

after Jean Follain
In the evenings they listen to the same 
tunes nobody could call happy 
somebody turns up at the edge of town 
the roses bloom 
and an old dinner bell rings once more 
under the thunder clouds 
In front of the porch posts of the store 
a man seated on a soda water case 
turns around and spits and says 
to everybody 
in his new set of clothes 
holding up his hands 
as long as I live nobody 
touches my dogs my friends





The Snake Doctors
 

for Nicholas Fuhrmann
I   Pig 

I was in the outhouse 
I heard somebody at the pump 
I looked out the chink hole 
It was the two fishermen 
They stole fish 

One man gave the other one some money 
He flipped a fifty-cent piece up 
I lost it in the sun 
I saw the snake doctors riding each other 
The other man said "You lose 
He took something else out of his pocket 
It shined 
They had a tow sack 
I thought they were cleaning fish 
I looked up 
I saw the snake doctors riding each other 

I took my eye away 
It was dark in the outhouse 
I whistled 

I heard the pump again 
It sounded broken 
I looked out the chink hole 
It wasn't the pump 
It was the pig 

The guitar player cut them out 
The midget helped him 
"Pump me some water, midget he said 

The pig ran off 

The guitar player washed off his hands 
The midget washed off the nuts 
He got a drink 
My eye hurt 

He laughed 
He cleaned the blood off his knife    He wiped   
      it on his leg 
He started singing 
The dog tried to get the nuts 
But the midget kicked him 

The guitar player picked them up 
He put them in his pocket 
The dog went over to the pig 
He licked him 

I pulled my pants up 
I went outside 

I got the pig 
I walked over to the pump 
I said "Don't you ever lay a hand   
            on this pig again 
The guitar player laughed 

He asked me if I wanted the nuts back 
He took them out of his pocket 
He spit on them 
He shook them like dice 
He threw them on the ground 
He said "Hah 
The midget stomped on them 

I had the pig under my arm 
He was bleeding on my foot    I said 
"Midget, I got friends on that river 


II   The Acolyte 

The men rode by 

I passed them on the road 
They smelled like dead fish 

The one in front had a guitar on his back 
The other one had a chain saw 

I was riding the hog 
He weighed three-hundred pounds 
I called him Holy Ghost 

The midget flashed a knife 
He thumbed the blade 
He smiled at me 
He called me "Pig Rider 

I rode over to Baby Gauge's 
I was on my way to church 
I had to get the red cassock 
I tied the hog to the front porch 
Baby Gauge was swinging in a tire 
Born In The Camp With Six Toes was sleeping in the icebox 

Baby Gauge said "Be at the levee at three o'clock 
I put the robe on 
I said "I almost got drowned last time 
"Going to have a mighty good time he said 
"Going to be an eclipse Born In The Camp With Six Toes said 

I rode the hog to church 

I took the new shoes off 
I lit the candles 
I changed the book 
I rung the bell 

I was drinking the wine 
I heard Baby Gauge yell 

I ran down the aisle 
I saw the men at the trough 
They were beating the hog over the head with sledge hammers 
It was like the clock in the German pilot's shack 

One of his eyes was hanging out 
And the trough was running over with blood 

They held his head under the water 
He was rooting in his own blood 
He pumped it out in a mist 
Like a buck shot in the lung 
It was black 

He broke loose 

I ran down the road yelling 
I stepped on soda bottle caps 
I ran through sardine cans 
I tripped on the cassock 

The hog was crazy 
He ran into the church 
He ran into tombstones 

I said "Somebody throw me something 
Chinaman threw me a knife 

I ran after the hog 
He was heading for the river 
I jumped on his back 

I rode the hog 
I hugged his neck 
I stabbed him seven times 
I wanted the knife to go into me 
He kept running 
I ran the knife across his throat 
And the blood came out like a bird 

We ran into a sycamore tree 

When the cloud passed over the moon 
Like a turkey shutting its eye 
I rowed out into the slew 
Not allowing myself to sing gospel music 

I woke up in a boat 
It was full of blood 
My feet were dragging through the water 
A knife was sticking in the prow 
And the sun was black 

It was dark 
But I saw the snake doctors riding each other 

I saw my new shoes 
I put them on 
They filled up with blood 

I took the surplice off 
I threw it in the river 
I watched it sink 
There was hog blood in my hair 

I knelt in the prow with the knife in my mouth 
I looked at myself in the water 
I heard someone singing on the levee 

I was buried in a boat 
I woke up 
I set it afire with the taper 
I watched myself burn 
I reached in the ashes and found a red knife 

I held my head under the water 
      so I wouldn't go crazy 
It was some commotion 
I rowed the boat in a circle with one oar 

A hundred people were in the water 
They had white robes on 
Some of them had umbrellas 
They jumped up and down on the bank 
They rowed down the levee 
They were yelling and singing 
One of them saw me 
I saw a horse with tassels 

I put my head under the water 
I thought I was dead 
I hit it on a cypress knee 

Two Negroes came riding through the river 
They rode towards me on the moon-blind horse 

One of them was drinking soda water 
"Where are you going, boy Baby Gauge said 

The horse swam back to the levee 
I was with them 
The boat drifted away 
A man said "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego 



III   Hambone 

They tied his hind legs together 
And hung him in a tree with a log chain 

I saw them 
I was on Baby Gauge's horse 
I threw a knife at the midget 
So they hung me up by the feet too 

I saw them break his neck 
I saw them pull his legs apart 
    like a wishbone 
I wished the dead came back 

The midget stood on a bucket 
He reached up in the hog's throat 
And pulled the heart out 

The dog was lying on the ground 
With his mouth open 

It took all day to butcher the hog 
I got dizzy 
I saw the snake doctors riding each other 

They turned the bucket over 
It filled up with blood 

They made a fire 

The guitar player beat his hand over his leg 
He put some meat on the fire 

They tried to make me eat it 

The midget spit a bone on the ground 

The other one picked it up 
He put it on his finger 

He went over and got his guitar 
He tried to play it like a Negro 
There was too much grease on his hands 
He got blood on the guitar 

The midget danced around the campfire 
I wanted to cut his throat 

The dog bayed at the moon 
And the blue Andalusian rooster played with a snake 
I was bleeding out my nose 

The fish bandits loaded the hog on Baby Gauge's horse 
They threw blood on the fire 
And filled the bucket up with guts for fish bait 
When they rode off I yelled "Peckerwoods 

I dreamed I saw Holy Ghost walking around the campfire 
He was a wild hog with blood on his tushes 

Along about midnight I heard a boat 
    but no rowing 
Somebody short came walking out of the woods 
With a light on his head 
The light went out I couldn't see 
He drew something out of his boot 
He grabbed me by the hair 
I saw a knife in the moonlight 
"Sweet Jesus I said 

Born In The Camp With Six Toes cut me down 


IV   Chainsaw 

The man cut his hand off at dawn 
I heard him yell 
I set up in bed 

He ran past the window 
"Don't let the dog get it he said 

I got out of bed 
I had the long handles on 
It was cold 
I threw some wood on the fire 
I put the dime around my ankle 
I put my boots on 
I put a knife in the boot 

I walked out to the road 
The blue Andalusian rooster followed me 
It was dark 

I heard the chainsaw in the woods 
I heard him singing all night 
He was cutting firewood 
He was drunk 

The dog quit barking 

I drew the knife out of my boot 
I looked for the midget 
I saw the blood and I tracked it 
I saw the sun and the moon 
I saw the snake doctors riding each other 

The hand was in the sawdust 
It was moving 

The hambone was on the finger 
It was morning 
The dog didn't get it 
I did 

There was blood on the chainsaw 
I told the blue rooster 
"He thought it was a guitar 

I walked around the hand seven times 
I poked it with a stick 
I sung to it 
I picked it up like a snake 
I took the hambone off the finger 
I put Holy Ghost's bone in my boot 
I put the hand on a stump 

I danced on the hand 
I peed on it 
I broke a wine bottle over it 
I threw it up in the air and a hawk 
    hit it 
The dog licked the blood out of the dust 

I saw the fish bandit's guitar 
The blue rooster pecked it 
I beat the hand with it 
I threw the guitar in the river 
The snake doctors lit on it 
It floated away 

I went down to the bank 
I got a pole 
I put a hook through the hand 
I washed it off 
When I touched the wound with my knife 
    it rolled up in a fist 

Somebody came by in a boat 
They held up a big fish 
So I held up the hand 

They jumped out of the boat 
They thought I crossed them 
One of them said "That wasn't no hoodoo, was it 
It was Baby Gauge 
I said "No, it was the guitar player's hand 
They swam to the bank 
I told them how I came by it 
Born In The Camp With Six Toes said "It won't 
Take another fish off my lines 

I asked them "You want to shake it 
Baby Gauge said "No, I want to spit on it 
We spit on the hand 

They left 

I wrapped it up in newspaper like fish 
I took it home 

I put it under Jimmy's pillow 
and he knocked my teeth out 
I put it in a cigar box with a picture 
      of Elvis Presley 
I took it to town 

I walked over to the dance hall 
The guitar player was bleeding in the back of the pickup 

I gave him the cigar box 
He passed out 

The midget pulled a knife on me 
I picked up the hand 
He ran off 

On the way home I ran folks off the road 
When the truck came by the house 
The guitar player raised up in the bed 
He said "Give me my hand back 

When it was dark 
I tied fish line to it and hung it 
    in the outhouse 
I sung to it 
The moon shined through the chink hole 
on the hand 

I took it down 
I threw it in a yellow jacket nest 
I stomped on it 

I took it to the palm reader 
I said "Sister, read this 

A lot of evenings I listened for them 
I knew they would come back 

When a stranger got a drink at night 
I thought it was the Holy Ghost 
And sometimes a cloud went by like a three-legged dog 
And the thunder was someone with a shotgun 
Letting him have it 

Now the moon was a fifty-cent piece 
It was a belly I wanted 
      to cut open 

When the flies got bad 
I kept the hand in the smokehouse 






V   Swimming at Night 

The midget ran his finger across his neck 
The other one said "Give it back 

I waited in the outhouse 
I had a sawed-off shotgun 
The men rode off 

In the afternoon they sold fish 
They cleaned them at the pump 
The scales dried up on their faces 
They loaded the meat on stolen horses 

At night they rode up shooting pistols 
I slept with an ice pick under my pillow 

One night they rode up drunk 
The midget was sitting in the guitar player's lap 
He said "Come on out 

They tied a bale of hay to Baby Gauge's horse 
They poured coal oil on it 
They set it on fire 
They laughed 

The horse with the moon eye pranced around them 
He galloped home 

I carved wild hog out of a cypress knee 
I made it the handle 
I made four tushes out of the hambone 
I used the blade I brought out of the fire 
And sealed the pig with 
It was the blade I put the burning horse to sleep with 
I called the knife the Holy Ghost 

To make me go crazy 
I took all my clothes off 
And jumped down the hole in the outhouse 
I grabbed the yellow jacket nest 
And held it over my heart 
I pumped cold water over myself 
And wallowed in the mud 
I walked through the snake den barefooted 
I swam the river at midnight 
With the hand and a blue feather in my mouth 
And the Holy Ghost around my neck 

And the hooks caught in my arms    they caught in my legs 
I cut the trot lines in two 
I saw the guitar player stealing the fish 

I was swimming beneath the shack 
Under the sleeping midget 
With the fish bandit's hand in my mouth 

I climbed through the trap door 
I crawled under the bed 
I cut the hooks out 
I believe I was snake bit 
I put the hand in the slop jar 
I reached up and tickled his nose with the feather 

He got out of bed 
He turned the lights on 
He let down his pants 
He reached under the bed for the slop jar 
He took the lid off 
He screamed 
I brought the knife across his leg 
I hamstrung the midget 

I swam under the water 
With the hand in my mouth 

I came up near the guitar player's boat 
He was running the lines 

I swam to the other end of the trot line 
I put the hand on a hook 
I jerked the lines like a big fish 

The guitar player worked his way down 
He thought he had a good one 

I let go of the line 
He saw his left hand 
He screamed 
He fell out of the boat 

I swam back through the river 
I buried the knife in the levee 

I was sleeping in the Negro's lap 
He was spitting snuff on my wounds 

Born In The Camp With Six Toes cut me with a knife 
Baby Gauge sucked the poison out 
Oh Sweet Jesus the levees that break in my heart





Circle of Lorca
 

When you take the lost road 
You come to the snow 
And when you find the snow 
You get down on your hands and knees 
Like a sick dog 
That's been eating the grasses of graveyards 
For twenty centuries. 

When you take the lost road 
You find woman 
Who has no fear of light 
Who can kill two cocks at once 
Light which has no fear of cocks 
And cocks who can't call in the snow. 

You find lovers who've been listening 
For the same roosters to sing 
For twenty centuries 
Roosters that have swallowed stones 
Out of each other's tracks 
But have never met 
Anywhere on the road. 

When you take the lost road 
You find the bright feathers of morning 
Laid out in proportion to snow and light 
And when the snow gets lost on the road 
Then the hot wind might blow from the south   
And there is sadness in bed for twenty centuries 
And everyone is chewing the grass on the graves again. 

When you get lost 
You come to the moon in the field 
The light all lovers soil 
The sheet no one leaves clean 
The light cocks are afraid to cross 
The same moon woman danced under 
For twenty centuries 
With blood on her face. 

When you get lost on the road 
You run into the dead 
Who have broken down stones 
In their throats for twenty centuries 
I saw two little crazy boys crying 
Because it was morning 
And when morning comes it comes 
In the morning and never at night. 

I saw two security police taking out a man's balls 
And I saw two little crazy boys 
Crying by the road who wouldn't go away 
But two has never been a number 
Because it's only legal to pass one at a time 
It's only a drum you can carry but you can't beat 
It's the evidence they need to make you disappear.





Weariness of Men
 

My grandmother said when she was young 
The grass was so wild and high 
You couldn't see a man on horseback. 

In the fields she made out 
Three barns, 
Dark and blown down from the weather 
Like her husbands. 

She remembers them in the dark, 
Cursing the beasts, 
And how they would leave the bed 
In the morning, 
The dead grass of their eyes 
Stacked against her.





Everybody Who is Dead
 

When a man knows another man 
Is looking for him 
He doesn't hide. 

He doesn't wait 
To spend another night 
With his wife 
Or put his children to sleep. 

He puts on a clean shirt and a dark suit 
And goes to the barber shop 
To let another man shave him. 

He shuts his eyes 
Remembers himself as a boy 
Lying naked on a rock by the water. 

Then he asks for the special lotion. 
The old men line up by the chair 
And the barber pours a little 
In each of their hands.





Faith, Dogma, and Heresy
 

It was Sunday, before dinner. 
My uncles were listening to the opera. 
O.Z. and I carried my brother in 
And laid him on the table. 
The women started screaming. 
My brother raised up on his side 
With dried blood on his hands, 
We killed those goddamn Canale brothers 
And nobody is ever going to touch us! 
The men shut their eyes and danced. 
We drank until morning 
When everything was quiet. 
They wiped their eyes, kissed us goodbye and left.





What About This
 

A guy comes walking out of the garden 
Playing Dark Eyes on the accordian. 
We're sitting on the porch, 
Drinking and spitting, lying. 
We shut our eyes, snap our fingers. 
Dewhurst goes out to his truck 
Like he doesn't believe what he's seeing 
And brings back three-half-pints. 
A little whirlwind occurs in the road, 
Carrying dust away like a pail of water. 
We're drinking serious now, and O.Z. 
Wants to break in the store for some head cheese, 
But the others won't let him. 
Everybody laughs, dances. 
The crossroads are all quiet 
Except for the little man on the accordian. 
Things are dying down, the moon spills its water. 
Dewhurst says he smells rain. 
O.Z. says if it rains he'll still make a crop. 
We wait there all night, looking for rain. 
We haven't been to sleep, so the blue lizards 
On the side of the white porch 
Lose their tails when we try to dream. 
The man playing the music looks at us, 
Noticing what we're up to. He backs off, 
Holding up his hands in front, smiling, 
Shaking his head, but before he gets half way 
Down the road that O.Z. shoots him in the belly. 
All summer his accordian rotted in the ditch, 
Like an armadillo turning into a house payment.





The Wolves
 

at night while the dogs 
were barking 
Baby Gauge and I crawled under the fence 
with knives 
we made out like the rattlesnake melons 
were men we didn't like 
the new moon ones were wolves 
I would cut a belly this way 
he would cut a belly that way 
the flies 
came around the sweet juice 
it was blood to us 
we tasted it we licked it off the blades 
we decided not to kill the wolves 
we wanted to be wolves 
we stuck the knives in the ground 
the moon shined on them 
we turned the pilot caps inside out 
so the fur would show 
that way when we crawled 
under the bob wire 
a little piece would get caught 
we wouldn't though 
we wanted to leave trails 
but no scents 
we tore the melons open we licked the blood off our paws 
we wanted to be wolves 
and in the morning all those dead men 
with their hearts eat out





You
 

Sometimes in our sleep we touch 
The body of another woman 
And we wake up 
And we know the first nights 
With summer visitors 
In the three storied house of our childhood. 
Whatever we remember, 
The darkest hair being brushed 
In front of the darkest mirror 
In the darkest room.   





Freedom, Revolt, and Love
 

They caught them. 
They were sitting at a table in the kitchen. 
It was early. 
They had on bathrobes. 
They were drinking coffee and smiling. 
She had one of his cigarillos in her fingers. 
She had her legs tucked up under her in the chair. 
They saw them through the window. 
She thought of them stepping out of a bath 
And him wrapping cloth around her. 
He thought of her waking up in a small white building, 
He thought of stones settling into the ground. 
Then they were gone. 
Then they came in through the back. 
Her cat ran out. 
The house was near the road. 
She didn't like the cat going out. 
They stayed at the table. 
The others were out of breath. 
The man and the woman reached across the table. 
They were afraid, they smiled. 
The others poured themselves the last of the coffee 
Burning their tongues. 
The man and the woman looked at them. 
They didn't say anything. 
The man and the woman moved closer to each other, 
The round table between them. 
The stove was still on and burned the empty pot. 
She started to get up. 
One of them shot her. 
She leaned over the table like a schoolgirl doing her lessons. 
She thought about being beside him, being asleep. 
They took her long grey socks 
Put them over the barrel of a rifle 
And shot him. 
He went back in his chair, holding himself. 
She told him hers didn't hurt much, 
Like in the fall when everything you touch 
Makes a spark. 
He thought about her getting up in the dark 
Wrapping a quilt around herself 
And standing in the doorway. 
She asked the men if they shot them again 
Not to hurt their faces. 
One of them lit him one of his cigarettes. 
He thought what it would be like 
Being children together. 
He was dead before he finished it. 
She asked them could she take it out of his mouth. 
So it wouldn't burn his lips. 
She reached over and touched his hair. 
She thought about him walking through the dark singing. 
She died on the table like that, 
Smoke coming out of his mouth.





["The Last Supper] from The Battlefield Where the Moon Says I Love You
 

I am afraid after reading all these so-called initiation books that some 
cortege of boot lickers will enter my room while I am sleeping and suck 
my eyes out with soda straws they will be older men and women much like 
the amanuenses with bad breath in the principal's office who call 
up and tell on you the Unferths of the world better beware 
I know Jesus would have kicked your teeth in you couldn't pull that shit on him 
he was telling his buddies one night boys I'm glad y'all decided to come on up 
and eat supper with me I hadn't got much there's a few things I'd like to say 
at this time Matthew says to Simon I sure as hell don't know what he's got us 
here this time for I'm beginning to wonder you talked to him lately 
yea I was shooting the shit with him on the mountain but I want to tell you 
this Matthew don't never come up on him when he's alone he jumped on me 
I thought he was going to kill me he was just walking around just talking 
to himself waving his arms like he does he's worse than John    
Jude put his hand up to his mouth and said down the table I think Jesus is going 
off his rocker get Simon to tell you what he asked me 
Simon says he didn't want to talk about politics or dreams or nothing he just said 
Jude next time y'all are over in Mesopotamia why don't you pick me up a few   
bottles of that wine they make over there 
sure thing Jesus I says 
well now the boss is talking he is saying I asked y'all up here because frankly 
I've been feeling a little sick lately and I want to make sure y'all know what 
to do in case anything happens I know one of you is going to do me in I know 
that but goddamnit y'all know those people in town are after my ass 
the other night I walked down the streets in a disguise and I seen a couple 
of you messing around and drinking with the soldiers what's going to happen 
if one of you gets drunk and lets it slip where I'm hiding out then I'll 
be in a fix you know if they was to find me they going to cut me y'all ever 
think about that and Peter ain't you ever going to get it straight what you're 
supposed to do give me one of those biscuits Judas and go outside and take a   
look-see I got you Jesus Judas says 
John leans over he says been catching any fish Peter 
oh well I been getting a few of a morning they ain't biting too good now you know 
on account of this blamed weather nobody is even listening to Jesus he's just 
talking to himself like he was crazy Matthew says I believe he's been hitting 
that wine a little too hard don't you reckon 
Jesus says another thing I told all of you it'd be better if you didn't get 
involved with women 
now just listen to that little two-faced bastard James the Lesser says 
we all know what he's up to shacking up with all those town girls 
the other night he was dressed fit to kill and drunk as six hundred dollars 
a rolling around in the mud like a hog kissing that whore's foot why shit 
I wish he'd let us in on what he really does 
Thomas spoke up for once he says I know what you mean the other day Andrew 
and I asked him about some scripture he said leave me alone I don't know 
nothing about that shit and then we seen him cussing out a priest over at the   
temple he knew more about it than the elder did 
another thing Matthew says I wish he'd start writing what he wants done down 
and do it so I can read it you know as well as I do that damned Peter can't 
keep it straight he won't get anything right 
Bartholomew says don't make no difference atoll cause Paul is going to tell 
it like he wants to that's for damned sure 
all the time Jesus just mumbling to himself wine spilt all over his robe 
the rest of them chattering and cussing trying to figure him out 
John the Baptist about the only one Jesus can count on except for crazy John    
is banging his goblet on the table he is saying now ain't this a sight 
spitting in the lord's face at his own birthday party I'll swan 
Brother John why don't you tell Jesus what the real problem is 
the crazy one says everyone of y'all is chickenshits you are afraid to look 
those elders in the eye and tell them what you think ya'll get up on a rock 
to talk and you see a soldier coming and you say anybody seen a stray mule 
Jesus is saying to himself I'm going to pull those temples down if I have to 
get me a rope and tie it to a pillar and a jackass and do it myself 
wake up Jesus Philip says 
Paul who hadn't touched a drop gets up and gets his paper out and says 
the nature of the problem Jesus is this the people don't believe you 
those fellows in the temples have got it all organized all they have to do 
is send out stooges and hire a couple of rednecks who make out like they're 
crippled they have a big gathering they say the same things you say they   
pull off a fake healing the redneck's wife stands up she says LIE he ain't lame 
he's just drunk and so all the people go home saying those christians what a   
bunch of wind see Jesus they are using your material but they ain't coming 
through so that is making you an enemy of the people we just got to get 
organized as is proved here today by your followers carrying on as they did 
so I'm getting sold down the river by the elders and their hirelings uh 
that's right Jesus ask anybody here why I didn't think they'd do that he says 
I told you a long time ago not to keep talking with them temple people John says 
you should a know'd what they was up to ain't nobody going to understand you 
why you ought to know that when we first run on to you we had second thoughts 
we thought you was crazy there's probably still some sitting down here right   
this second that still thinks you are a crazy one but Jesus you should a known 
we been through a lot together we go a long way back you should a listened 
all they wanted was you they liable to get you yet then they won't have no 
competition they want to keep feeding the hogs the same slop 
they the ones that want to get fat man you listening to me Jesus 
he says ok if that's the way they want to do things at the temple 
I'm going to change my tactics I going out after these chillun more than I have 
been they'll know I'm telling the truth I still got a few things up my sleeve 
left what's that Paul says 
I'm going to do a few things can't nobody follow 
we could always go back to biting the heads off fish and chickens Peter says 
why don't you let us in on it for a change Paul says we follow you around 
like we were a bunch of sheep picking up your tab bailing you out of jail 
coming up here all the time for supper and what do we get to eat nothing 
why can't you have a little faith in us Jesus 
ok this is what we going to do he says hold on who is that walking up the steps 
it's just Judas 
how does it go boy Jesus says and the other one answers just fine Jesus just fine 
and John the Baptist turns around he says to the one who has just slipped in boy 
didn't I see you talking to some white folks the other day 
here endeth with a chord on the guitar that's how the men did Jesus like he was 
old like he was young just like Elvis did to Big Dad Arthur I know 
just like another blind singer the men come down to see with their equipment 
they get his song they pay him twenty dollars and he don't hear from them ever 
again except sometimes in the mail on Christmas when one of them might send a   
five dollar check there won't nobody cash oh tell me brother how do the old men 
feel who were young as purple flowers from Hawaii once when they listen to their 
songs coming in over a borrowed radio tell me don't they take up a notch in they belt 
don't they tie another knot in they headband don't they wring that sweat out 
have mercy Jesus deliver me from the lawyers and the teachers and the preachers 
and the politicking flies can't you hear them buzz can't you hear them bite another 
chunk out of me oh brother I am death and you are sleep I am white and you are 
black brother tell me I am that which I am I am sleep and you are death we are 
one person getting up and going outside naked as a blue jay rolling our bellies 
at the moon oh brother tell me you love me and I'll tell you too I want to know 
how do they like it when the ones who sung shake they leg on the Television

Aunt Madelyn At The White Sale
 

Here is the kingdom of irregulars, 
land of no-two-alike, 
I hunt furiously 
useful towels. Closets simmering with 
terry, linen, beach or tea 
can never be full 
enough to stop these sprees. 

Hoarding is relative 
to love or fear, but not to need. Mother stockpiled 
soap in step-on cans. 
When the lid snapped back, 
instead of grinds, grease, skins, it was good 
to get a whiff 
of the bars, neat and brightly wrapped as gifts. 

Waving us off on dates, she'd yell "Be back by twelve 
and don't come home 
if you get killed." But I wasn't killed, 
easy as that seemed. I hadn't figured on 
life's pigheadedness: 
how the breath and pulse are triggered by a hardwon 
inability to unexist. How death is 

tightfisted. I thought 
at first there'd been a car crash: my voice soared, brilliant 
and bubbling with drugs: oh, that that too too 
euphoric 
stutter should be mine! 
Then, with a coziness worse than constraint, they 
spoke of the cerebral pinch I'd been in, praised 

the luck that chucked me 
back to sanitized light. Where towels absorb their weight 
in chaos. Where I am serene. 
Like those damn orchids-- 
vivid, blizzardy sprays Tom and I trucked 
out West that time, and, one by one, heat or dark 
got them: my brainwaves. 

The last was that dendrobium...or is 
that my medication? See? Last week I went 
and rang the wrong bell 
after twenty-odd years of visiting 
my beaming, well-meaning sister. 
I worry now 
about another sister who manages neither 

smiles nor meaning. Those years I coaxed her through 
treatments, hoping-- 
if not for her thanks or love, then what? 
Nothing...but the nothing I've received 
has me shuddering. 
Rage makes my blood astringent as witch hazel. 
I'll pretend not to see them pretend not to 

see my infirmities: 
My restless hands. Idling. Pilling the spread. 
Of course, you can get killed at home and that's something 
Mother never mentioned. My mind drifts 
to my friend Miriam, that deadly fire--I see again 
her pleasant, stocky face. "Mada, we're sharp 
as ever," she said last time, 

but she was fooled. With luck she slept right through. 
Outside snowflakes lift, float sideways, and seem 
to say "ground has nothing 
to do with me!" But this is silly. 
Though I can't trace one among the calm bustle 
of shoppers, I tell myself 
they are falling, they do touch earth, and they 


never rise at all.





The Dream of February
 

 
         I 
In the moonlight, 
in the heavy snow, 
I was hunting along 
the sunken road 
and heard behind me 
the quiet step 
and smothered whimper 
of something following . . .

Ah, tree of panic 
I climbed 
to escape the night, 
as the furry body glided 
beneath, lynx with   
steady gaze, and began 
the slow ascent. 

         II 
And dark blue foxes 
climbed beside me with 
famished eyes that   
glowed in the shadows; 

I stabbed with 
a sharpened stick until 
one lay across 
the path with entrails 
spilled, and 
the others melted away. 

The dead fox 
moved again, his jaws 
released the 
sound of speech. 

         III 
Slowly I toiled 
up the rotting stairs 
to the cemetery 
where my mother lay buried, 

to find the open grave 
with the coffin 
tilted beside it, 
and something spilled 
from the bottom-- 

a whiteness that flowed 
on the ground 
and froze into mist that 
enveloped the world.





The Snowbound City
 

I believe in this stalled magnificence, 
this churning chaos of traffic, 
a beast with broken spine, 
its hoarse voice hooded in feathers 
and mist; the baffled eyes 
wink amber and slowly darken. 

Of men and women suddenly walking, 
stumbling with little sleighs 
in search of Tibetan houses -- 
dust from a far-off mountain 
already whitens their shoulders. 

When evening falls in blurred heaps, 
a man losing his way among churches 
and schoolyards feels under his cold hand 
the stone thoughts of that city, 

impassable to all but a few children 
who went on into the hidden life 
of caves and winter fires, 
their faces glowing with disaster.





The Sweater of Vladimir Ussachevsky
 

Facing the wind of the avenues 
one spring evening in New York, 
I wore under my thin jacket 
a sweater given me by the wife 
of a genial Manchurian. 

The warmth in that sweater changed 
the indifferent city block by block. 
The buildings were mountains 
that fled as I approached them. 

The traffic became sheep and cattle 
milling in muddy pastures. 
I could feel around me the large 
movements of men and horses. 

It was spring in Siberia or Mongolia, 
wherever I happened to be. 
Rough but honest voices called to me 
out of that solitude: 
they told me we are all tired 
of this coiling weight, 
the oppression of a long winter; 
that it was time to renew our life, 
burn the expired contracts, 
elect new governments. 

The old Imperial sun has set, 
and I must write a poem to the Emperor. 
I shall speak it like the man 
I should be, an inhabitant of the frontier, 
clad in sweat-darkened wool, 
my face stained by wind and smoke. 

Surely the Emperor and his court 
will want to know what a fine 
and generous revolution begins tomorrow 
in one of his remote provinces... 

                                                    (1967)





The Girl Who Buried Snakes in a Jar
 

She came to see the bones 
whiten in a summer, 
and one year later a narrow 
mummy with a dusty skin 
and flaking scales 
would break apart in her hand. 

She wanted to see if sunlight 
still glinted in those eyes, 
to know what it lighted 
from a window on the mallow roots, 
leaf mold and fallen casques. 

And to ask if a single tongue, 
one forked flicker in the dark, 
had found any heat in death: 
in the closed space and chill 
of that burial, what speech, 
what sign would there be. 

She who walked in the canyon early, 
parted the grass and halted 
upon the living snake, coiled 
and mottled by a bitter pool, 

unearthed her jar in another spring, 
to find the snake spirit gone, 
only a little green water standing, 
some dust, or a smell. 

                                                    (1974)





Fourth of July at Santa Ynez
 

         I 
Under the makeshift arbor of leaves 
a hot wind blowing smoke and laughter. 
Music out of the renegade west, 
too harsh and loud, many dark faces 
moved among the sweating whites. 

         II 
Wandering apart from the others, 
I found an old Indian seated alone 
on a bench in the flickering shade. 

He was holding a dented bucket; 
three crayfish, lifting themselves 
from the muddy water, stirred 
and scraped against the greasy metal. 

         III 
The old man stared from his wrinkled 
darkness across the celebration, 
unblinking, as one might see 
in the hooded sleep of turtles. 

A smile out of the ages of gold 
and carbon flashed upon his face 
and vanished, called away 
by the sound and the glare around him, 
by the lost voice of a child 
piercing that thronged solitude. 

         IV 
The afternoon gathered distance 
and depth, divided in the shadows 
that broke and moved upon us . . .

Slowly, too slowly, as if returned 
from a long and difficult journey, 
the old man lifted his bucket 
and walked away into the sunlit crowd.

Duncan
 

1 
When in his twenties a poetry's full strength 
Burst into voice as an unstopping flood, 
He let the divine prompting (come at length) 
Rushingly bear him any way it would 
And went on writing while the Ferry turned 
From San Francisco, back from Berkeley too, 
And back again, and back again. He learned 
You add to, you don't cancel what you do. 

Between the notebook-margins his pen travelled, 
His own lines carrying him in a new mode 
To ports in which past purposes unravelled. 
So that, as on the Ferry Line he rode, 
Whatever his first plans that night had been, 
The energy that rose from their confusion 
Became the changing passage lived within 
While the pen wrote, and looked beyond conclusion. 


2 
Forty years later, and both kidneys gone; 
Every eight hours, home dialysis; 
The habit of his restlessness stayed on 
Exhausting him with his responsiveness. 
After the circulations of one day 
In which he taught a three-hour seminar 
Then gave a reading clear across the Bay, 
And while returning from it to the car 

With plunging hovering tread tired and unsteady 
Down Wheeler steps, he faltered and he fell 
--Fell he said later, as if I stood ready, 
"Into the strong arms of Thom Gunn." 
                                                      Well well, 
The image comic, as I might have known, 
And generous, but it turned things round to myth: 
He fell across the white steps there alone, 
Though it was me indeed that he was with. 

I hadn't caught him, hadn't seen in time, 
And picked him up where he had softly dropped, 
A pillow full of feathers. Was it a rime 
He later sought, in which he might adopt 
The role of H.D., broken-hipped and old, 
Who, as she moved off from the reading-stand, 
Had stumbled on the platform but was held 
And steadied by another poet's hand? 

He was now a posthumous poet, I have said 
(For since his illness he had not composed), 
In sight of a conclusion, whose great dread 
Was closure, 
                  his life soon to be enclosed 
Like the sparrow's flight above the feasting friends, 
Briefly revealed where its breast caught their light, 
Beneath the long roof, between open ends, 
Themselves the margins of unchanging night.





Herbert White
 

"When I hit her on the head, it was good, 

and then I did it to her a couple of times,-- 
but it was funny,--afterwards, 
it was as if somebody else did it... 

Everything flat, without sharpness, richness or line. 

Still, I liked to drive past the woods where she lay, 
tell the old lady and the kids I had to take a piss, 
hop out and do it to her... 

The whole buggy of them waiting for me 
                                                             made me feel good; 
but still, just like I knew all along, 
                                                   she didn't move. 

When the body got too discomposed, 
I'd just jack off, letting it fall on her... 

--It sounds crazy, but I tell you 
sometimes it was beautiful--; I don't know how 
to say it, but for a minute, everything was possible--; 
and then, 
then,-- 
            well, like I said, she didn't move: and I saw, 
under me, a little girl was just lying there in the mud: 

and I knew I couldn't have done that,-- 
somebody else had to have done that,-- 
standing above her there, 
                                       in those ordinary, shitty leaves... 

--One time, I went to see Dad in a motel where he was 
staying with a woman; but she was gone; 
you could smell the wine in the air; and he started, 
real embarrassing, to cry... 
                                           He was still a little drunk, 
and he asked me to forgive him for 
all he hadn't done--; but, What the shit? 
Who would have wanted to stay with Mom? with bastards 
not even his own kids? 

                                  I got in the truck, and started to drive, 
and saw a little girl-- 
who I picked up, hit on the head, and 
screwed, and screwed, and screwed, and screwed, then 

buried, 
          in the garden of the motel... 

--You see, ever since I was a kid I wanted 
to feel things make sense: I remember 

looking out the window of my room back home,-- 
and being almost suffocated by the asphalt; 
and grass; and trees; and glass; 
just there, just there, doing nothing! 
not saying anything! filling me up-- 
but also being a wall; dead, and stopping me; 
--how I wanted to see beneath it, cut 

beneath it, and make it 
somehow, come alive... 

                                    The salt of the earth; 
Mom once said, 'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth...' 
--That night, at that Twenty-nine Palms Motel 
I had passed a million times on the road, everything 

fit together; was alright; 
it seemed like 
                     everything had to be there, like I had spent years 
trying, and at last finally finished drawing this 
                                                                           huge circle... 

--But then, suddenly I knew 
somebody else did it, some bastard 
had hurt a little girl--; the motel 
                                                      I could see again, it had been 

itself all the time, a lousy 
pile of bricks, plaster, that didn't seem to 
have to be there,--but was, just by chance... 

--Once, on the farm, when I was a kid, 
I was screwing a goat; and the rope around his neck 
when he tried to get away 
pulled tight;--and just when I came, 
he died... 
                        I came back the next day; jacked off over his body; 
but it didn't do any good... 

Mom once said: 
'Man's spunk is the salt of the earth, and grows kids.' 

I tried so hard to come; more pain than anything else; 
but didn't do any good... 

--About six months ago, I heard Dad remarried, 
so I drove over to Connecticut to see him and see 
if he was happy. 
                        She was twenty-five years younger than him: 
she had lots of little kids, and I don't know why, 
I felt shaky... 
                      I stopped in front of the address; and 
snuck up to the window to look in... 
                                                      --There he was, a kid 
six months old on his lap, laughing 
and bouncing the kid, happy in his old age 
to play the papa after years of sleeping around,-- 
it twisted me up... 
                            To think that what he wouldn't give me, 
                            he wanted to give them... 

                   I could have killed the bastard... 

--Naturally, I just got right back in the car, 
and believe me, was determined, determined, 
to head straight for home... 

                                          but the more I drove, 
I kept thinking about getting a girl, 
and the more I thought I shouldn't do it, 
the more I had to-- 

                            I saw her coming out of the movies, 
saw she was alone, and 
kept circling the blocks as she walked along them, 
saying, 'You're going to leave her alone.' 
'You're going to leave her alone.' 

                                                   --The woods were scary! 
As the seasons changed, and you saw more and more 
of the skull show through, the nights became clearer, 
and the buds,--erect, like nipples... 

--But then, one night, 
nothing worked... 
                                    Nothing in the sky 
would blur like I wanted it to; 
and I couldn't, couldn't, 
get it to seem to me 
that somebody else did it... 

I tried, and tried, but there was just me there, 
and her, and the sharp trees 
saying, 'That's you standing there. 
                                                    You're... 
                                                                  just you.' 

                                 I hope I fry. 

--Hell came when I saw 
                                     MYSELF... 
                                                      and couldn't stand 
what I see..."





Revelation at Cap Ferrat
 

It's not solely the dance 
of the juggler but his spirit: 
with its turkey wings, perfect thighs, 
sensuous hips, large round flat eye. 
This eye smiles like lips. 
Watch this eye-- 
it's not a donkey eye. 

It's not solely the dancer 
who moves like a circus animal 
as though to children's music--no, 
it's the girl in the swing's rhythm, 
the ticking of the clock at night, 
the strut of the cock, the flight 
of the holy family to the remains. 
The nipple that feeds 
the infant is an eye looking 
into his future. 

It's not even the village square 
with its musicians and happy faces 
that makes the difference--no, 
because if it were, weddings 
with violins, harps, flutes 
would have settled the question: 
no, it is the rising and lifting, 
the failing and catching of 
that unknown sense of self 
before it crashes, that matters.





Sand Flesh and Sky
 

Our ropes are the roots 
of our life. We fish 
low in the earth, 
the river beneath runs through our veins, 
blue and cold in a riverbed. 

When the sun comes up, 
the moon moves slowly to the left. 

I tie the logs and limbs together, 
holding them in place. 

The ocean beats them 
smooth like rock. 
Here my sense of time is flat. 

I find in a strip of damp sand 
footprints and marks of hands, 
and torn pieces of flesh. 

Night is a beast. 
The tide moves, gushing 
back and forth. 

Sunlight touches our faces, 
turning us, turning us, turning us 
in our morning sleep. 


         1976





San Diego and Matisse
 

1. INSIDE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A TREE 

Beautiful women in smoky blue culottes 
lying around on fluffy pink pillows 
beneath windows onto charming views, 
sea views, seasonal leaves and trees. 
Inside is outside and outside inside. 
Smell of saltwater swimming in the room. 


2. OUTSIDE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A ROCKING CHAIR 

Shadow of lighthouse along the beach. 
Whales spotted every day lately 
though winter's two months yet. 
The evening is as warm as an interior. 
Silverlight lagoonlight, snorkeling light. 
And a line of joggers against last light. 
Blue smoke snaking up the pink sky.





No One Goes to Paris in August
 

A Montparnasse August 
with view of the Cimetire. A yard of bones. 

We wake to it. Close curtains to it. 
Wake to its lanes. Rows of coffin-stones in varying light. 

Walking here. Late with shade low, low, long. 
We're passing through, just passing through 
neat aisles of gray mausoleums. 

(From Paris. Send this postcard. This one. 
Calm water lilies. Water lilies. 
Nothing colorless.) 

It's morning. Baudelaire's tomb. 
Tree limbs casting shadow west. 

This, a lot of time under a looming sky. 
Nobody has time like this. 
(Time to go to Le Mandarin for coffee 
every day. We're not complaining. 
They bring the milk separate. 
Watch the passersby on Saint-Germain.) 

Nothing to ponder. This is the plight. 
Pause by Pigeon in bed with his wife -- 
both fully dressed. 

Pink flowers, pink flowers, 
just beneath de Beauvoir's name. 
When she lived she lived two doors down. 
Went south in August. 

All of us smell of heat all the time. 
We are the living. Oh dear! 
There are the dead ones there. 
Their thoughts more familiar, though. 
Lives finished, nearly clear. 
And they make it possible for us to go on living 
as we do in their blue shade.





Photograph of a Gathering of People Waving
 

based on an old photograph bought in a  shop at Half Moon Bay, summer, 1999
No sound, the whole thing. 
Unknown folk. People waving from a hillside of ripple grass 
to people below in an ongoing meadow. 

Side rows of trees waving in a tide of wind, 
and because what is moving is not moving, 
you catch a state of stasis. 

Opposite of this inactivity 
you imagine distant music and buzzing and crickets 
and that special hot smell of summer. 

To the garden past the Bay to the meadow, 
cliff sheltered with low clouds, offset by nodding thistle. 
Tatter-wort and Stinking Tommy along footpath 
worn down by locals. But who and why? 

In the photograph itself you're now looking the other way 
to unknown clusters of houses. 
Where forces are balanced to near perfection. 

Who could live 
in such a great swollen silence and solitude? 
You hear church bells 
from Our Lady's Tears breaking that silence nicely 
but just in the right way so silence continues 
as though nothing else matters day after day. 

And anyway, each face seems so familiar. 

What do you do when you wave back? 
You wave vigorously. 
You remember your own meadow, 
your cliffside and town, 
photographs forgotten, 
the halfhearted motion of your hand, 
your grandmother's church-folk 
gathering on a Sunday afternoon in saintly quietness. 

You name the people 
whose names are not written on the back. 
You forgive them for wrapping themselves in silence. 

You enter house after house and open top-floor windows 
and you wave down to future generations like this.





The Painting After Lunch
 

It wasn't working. Didn't look back. Needed something else. So 
I went out. After lunch I saw it in a different light, like a thing 
emerging from behind a fever bush, something reaching the 
senses with the smell of seaweed boiling, and as visible as yellow 
snowdrops on black earth. Tasted it too, on the tongue Jamaica 
pepper. To the touch, a velvet flower. Dragging and scumming, I 
gave myself to it stroke after stroke. It kept coming in bits and fits, 
fragments and snags. I even heard it singing but in the wrong key 
like a deranged bird in wild cherries, having the time of its life.





Made to Measure
 

Impossible to wield 
The acreage of the fabric that unfolded, 
Slung from his shoulders like a crumpled field: 
The distance from one Christmas to the next 
When he was only seven 
Was aching there; a foreign city flexed 
Among the ripples; a face, the star-shocked heaven 
About his flailing arms were shrugged and moulded. 

Too heavy to outrun, 
Too slow to measure what it underwent, 
Though gradually the passage of the sun, 
Unmanageable in its train of light, 
Seemed almost to respond 
As he yanked the yards of stuff in like a kite 
And gathered the brocade that trailed beyond 
His arms' reach to the scale of measurement, 

However strange the weave 
That writhed about the working of his hands: 
The footage too atrocious to believe, 
Printed with corpses; Greece; the falls of salmon; 
Her upturned silken wrist 
He would have torn out history to examine; 
His father's final blessing, which he missed. 
However far he comes or where he stands, 

At last, and limb by limb, 
Contour by contour, that unfolded cape 
Settles ever more fittingly on him. 
His forehead is the line of the sky's vault, 
His shoulders trace the ground, 
His palms the ways he wandered by default, 
And in his gestures those he knew are found. 
What shape the day discovers is his shape.





The Red Sea
 

Lulled in a nook of North West Bay, 
The water swells against the sand, 
Hardly more liquid than Venetian glass, 
In which clear surface, just a little way 
From shore, some four or five petite yachts pass 
With languid ease, apparently unmanned, 
Adrift along the day, 

Imagining a breeze to fan 
Their motion, though there's none. Siobhan 
Reaches a giant hand down from the sky 
And nudges with insouciant lan 
The nearest hull, her bended waist mast-high. 
That hand is just as magically withdrawn. 
So moves the catamaran. 

And through the Lilliputian fleet 
She, Beatrice and Gabrielle 
Wade in the shallows, knee-deep, spaceman-slow, 
To fashion their maneuvers and compete   
Among the stationed hours to and fro, 
While watching through the viscid slide and swell 
Of water their white feet, 

Made curiously whiter by 
That cool light-bending element. 
Doubled by shadows on the sand they glimpse 
Pipefish and darting fingerlings they try 
Impossibly to grab, translucent shrimps 
Among the laceweed, seahorses intent 
To flee the peopled sky. 

Hard to conceive that they should be 
Precisely who they are and here, 
Lost in the idle luxury of play. 
And hard to credit that the selfsame sea 
That joins them in their idleness today, 
Careless of latitude and hemisphere, 
Blind with ubiquity, 

Churns elsewhere with a white uproar, 
Or wipes the Slave Coast clean of trees, 
Or sucks among the scum and floating drums 
Of some forgotten outpost founded for 
The advent of an age that never comes, 
Or bobs the remnants of atrocities 
Limply against the shore. 

What luck they have. And what good sense 
To leave the water with their toys 
When called, before their fortunes are deranged. 
And still the day hangs in its late suspense 
For hours without them, virtually unchanged, 
Until the bay's impregnable turquoise 
Relaxes its defense 

And sunset's dye begins to spread   
In flood across it to the sand 
They stood on, as though, hoping to disown 
The blood of all the innocents he'd shed, 
Macbeth incarnate or his grisly clone 
Had stooped on some far shore to rinse his hand, 
Making the green one red.





Nocturnal
 

It's midnight now and sounds like midnight then, 
The words like distant stars that faintly grace 
                     The all-pervading dark of space, 
                     But not meant for the world of men. 
                                        It's not what we forget 
But what was never known we most regret 
Discovery of. Checking one last cassette 
Among my old unlabelled discards, few 
Of which reward the playing, I find you. 

Some years after her death, but years ago, 
Hearing Gwen's voice recite "Suburban Sonnet," 
                     At first we could not focus on it, 
                     So jolted that the radio 
                                        Should casually exhume 
From our shared memory the woman whom 
We knew and make her present in the room, 
As though in flesh, surprised to find that she 
Had earned this further immortality. 

Who ever thought they would not hear the dead? 
Who ever thought that they could quarantine 
                     Those who are not, who once had been? 
                     At that old station on North Head 
                                        Inmates still tread the boards, 
Or something does; equipment there records 
The voices in the dormitories and wards, 
Although it's years abandoned. Undeleted, 
What happened is embedded and repeated, 

Or so they say. And that would not faze you 
Who always claimed events could not escape 
                     Their scenes, recorded as on tape 
                     In matter and played back anew 
                                        To anyone attuned 
To that stored energy, that psychic wound. 
You said you heard the presence which oppugned 
Your trespass on its lasting sole occasion 
In your lost house. I scarcely need persuasion, 

So simple is this case. Here in the dark 
I listen, tensing in distress, to each 
                     Uncertain fragment of your speech, 
                     Each desolate, half-drunk remark 
                                        You uttered unaware 
That this cassette was running and would share 
Far in the useless future your despair 
With one who can do nothing but avow 
You spoke from midnight, and it's midnight now.





Divine Rights
 

Sprawling like some small group of picnickers, 
They're propped among the shadows of the trees, 
Though one seems drunk, spread-eagled. Nothing stirs 
Except the flies that clog their cavities. 
A red cleft rules the parting of that head. 
You stretch a little and slide out of bed. 

Acres of debris are in sodden flood   
About the ruined village, which concedes 
In blackened matchwood to the tide of mud 
Its smoking households. Rising from the weeds, 
Arms reach up stiffly, as for an embrace. 
Out of the mirror you observe your face 

While sunlight offers all that you desire. 
The Aztecs, to appease your counterparts, 
Would hook still-living bodies from the fire, 
Hack out and hold aloft the pulsing hearts, 
Drenching the steps with blood, so they might give 
Those idle brutes each day a day to live. 

You have today. Stark-eyed and hollow-faced, 
Her rigid ribcage almost bursting through 
The skin, a girl sits in a land laid waste 
And stares out blankly. So then, it is you-- 
The thought had not occurred to you before-- 
It's you, Huitzilopochtli, God of War.





Hardys Catalogues
 

Fleeing his clubs, dull honors, wives, the ageing Hardy 
hunches down in his potting-shed with his thumbtip-fumbled, fine- 
printed seed catalogue's inflorescences-- 
peripherally glimpsing the oxygenless blue line 

of the fleur-de-lys scaling his inner wrist; 
his chalky knuckles, his forearm's crisp, lisse, 
pleated wrinkles; softly brown-spotted 
as a fox terrier's belly. Yet this pleases, only this-- 

age-speckled surfaces, sun-galls rose-speckled; puckering 
petals rugosely leaf-veined: the saturate, flooded 
stemlines' mauves and verdures on the backlit 

catalogue's tissuelike (nearly self-composting) 
pages--like his skin, all milliner-ribboned; yet with, barely hooded, 
things as they are and will be visible beneath it.





callas lover
 

this is the track I've had on REPEAT all afternoon:      she is butterfly 
brilliant riband, rice flour face, silken, even her voice a sashed kimono 

                             if I were foolish like her:    
                                          but aren't I foolish like her 
                             spotting the coil of smoke and the billowed sail 
                   against the verge of sky 

simple on the rise surveying the anchorage:      simple me, signal me 
dreading the confident assumption of return, dreading more 
uncertain tone to come, the thinning notes, performance 
too close to my own impatient--swells, a surge:      sick wind 

but the emotion is, after all, an artfully conjured gesture 
arranged marriage between a past ache and frail woodwinds 
                             I could skip ahead 
                                          could break the inconsolable loop 
of harbor, waiting, overlook, waiting, inevitable waning eye 

troubled robins, once more in the handkerchief trees 
once more, brief aquarelle of triplet lilies, blue as willowware   
in that interval before his embrace falters, stuck, founders 
              [shuffle play]    such a pitch of tenderness in the voice 
                             such an awful lot of noise





cruel, cruel summer
 

either the postagestamp-bright inflorescence of wild mustard 
or the drab tassel of prairie smoke, waving its dirty garments 

either the low breeze through the cracked window 
or houseflies and drawn blinds to spare us the calid sun 

one day commands the next to lie down, to scatter:      we're done 
with allegiance, devotion, the malicious idea of what's eternal 

picture the terrain sunk, return of the inland sea, your spectacle 
your metaphor, the scope of this twiggy dominion pulled under 

crest and crest, wave and cloud, the thunder blast and burst of swells 
this is the sum of us:      brief sneezeweed, brief yellow blaze put out 

so little, your departure, one plunk upon the earth's surface, 
one drop to bind the dust, a little mud, a field of mud 

the swale gradually submerged, gradually forgotten 
and that is all that is to be borne of your empirical trope: 

first, a congregated light, the brilliance of a meadowland in bloom 
and then the image must fail, as we must fail, as we 

graceless creatures that we are, unmake and befoul our beds 
don't tell me deluge.      don't tell me heat, too damned much heat





Man of War
 

After there were no women, men, and children, 

from the somber deeps horseshoe crabs crawled up on somber shores: 

Man-of-Wars' blue sails drifted downwind 

and blue filaments of some biblical cloak 

floated below: the stinging filaments. 

The cored of bone and rock-headed came near: 

clouds made wandering shadows: 

sea and grasses mingled:: 

There was no hell after all 

but a lull before it began over:: 

flesh lying alone: then mating: a little spray of soul: 

and the grace of waves, of stars, and remotest isles.





Argonaut's Vow
 

Pushed prow southerly into the golden wind: 

hurt the eyes: gold pelted water: so looked less far away: 

plovers huddling on the tide's last piece of shore: 

Rise up in brightness: clap wings:: 

I told myself I'll go where eagles go: if to brimstone: 

my wake a narrow river back 

to its source in cedar: and when sunlight embers 

the shore's soft fleece will be before me.





The Solipsist
 

Don't be misled: 
that sea-song you hear 
when the shell's at your ear? 
It's all in your head. 

That primordial tide-- 
the slurp and salt-slosh 
of the brain's briny wash-- 
is on the inside. 

Truth be told, the whole place, 
everything that the eye 
can take in, to the sky 
and beyond into space, 

lives inside of your skull. 
When you set your sad head 
down on Procrustes' bed, 
you lay down the whole 

universe. You recline 
on the pillow: the cosmos 
grows dim. The soft ghost 
in the squishy machine, 

which the world is, retires. 
Someday it will expire. 
Then all will go silent 
and dark. For the moment, 

however, the black- 
ness is just temporary. 
The planet you carry 
will shortly swing back 

from the far nether regions. 
And life will continue-- 
but only within you. 
Which raises a question 

that comes up again and again,   
as to why 
God would make ear and eye 
to face outward, not in?

Their ruler is elected state by state,

Repetition
 

Trying to walk 
the same way 
to the same store 
takes high-wire 
balance: 
each step 
not exactly 
as before 
risks chasms 
of flatness. 
One stumble 
alone and   
nothing 
happens. 
Few are 
the willing 
and fewer 
the champions.





The Late Worm
 

The worms 
which had been 
thick are thin 
upon the ground 
now that it's gotten 
later. They stick 
against the path, 
their pink chapped 
and their inching 
labored. It's a   
matter of moisture 
isn't it? Time, a   
measure of wet, 
shrinking, the 
drier you get.





Cut Out For It
 

Cut out 
as a horse 
is cut 
from the   
pack. Peeled 
off, but 
a long time 
back. Now 
such a feeling 
for the way 
they touch 
and shift 
as one, the 
beauty when 
they run.





Getting Where We're Going
 

Surfeit of distance and the wracked mind waiting, 
nipping at itself, snarling inwardly at strangers. 
If I had a car in this town I'd 
rig it up with a rear bumper horn, 
something to blast back at the jackasses 
who honk the second the light turns green. 
If you could gather up all the hornhonks 
of just one day in New York City, 
tie them together in a big brassy knot 
high above the city and honk 
them all at once it would shiver 
the skyscrapers to nothingness, as if 
they were made of sand, and usher 
in the Second Coming. Christ would descend 
from the sky wincing with his fingers 
in his ears and judge us all 
insane. Who'd want people like us 
up there yelling at each other, trashing 
the cloudy, angelic streets with our 
candywrappers and newspapers and coffeecups? 
Besides, we'd still be waiting for   
the next thing to happen in Heaven, 
the next violin concerto or cotton candy 
festival or breathtaking vista to open 
beneath our feet, and thinking this place 
isn't quite what it's cracked up to be, 
and why in hell does everybody 
want to get here? We'd still be 
waiting for someone else to come 
and make us happy, staring 
through whatever's in front of us, 
cursing the light that never seems to change.





A Night in Brooklyn
 

We undid a button, 
turned out the light, 
and in that narrow bed 
we built the great city-- 
water towers, cisterns,   
hot asphalt roofs, parks, 
septic tanks, arterial roads, 
Canarsie, the intricate channels, 
the seacoast, underwater mountains, 
bluffs, islands, the next continent, 
using only the palms of our hands 
and the tips of our tongues, next 
we made darkness itself, by then 
it was time for dawn 
and we closed our eyes   
and counted to ourselves 
until the sun rose 
and we had to take it all to pieces 
for there could be only one Brooklyn.





The Dead Remember Brooklyn
 

It is the great arguments 
we are proud of, over a nibbled peach, 
hair in the comb, a faulty lube job; 
the reconciliations were always naked 
in borrowed rooms, sometimes in Queens 
or Staten Island, we touched each other 
shyly--we reminded each other 
of loneliness and funk and beautiful pigeons 
with oil-slick necks, cooing bitterly-- 
but there we lost each other 
in forgiveness; keeping score, 
being wounded even in triumph, 
walking home down leafy avenues 
etched with the faint double line 
of extinct trolleys, caressing 
carved hearts under a sheen of sap 
with a ragged nail, sleeping alone, 
choosing the dream of betrayal, 
entering by the wide door 
and waking dead--there 
we were superb. In Brooklyn 
we held our own.





A Country Incident
 

Absorbed in planting bulbs, that work of hope, 
I was startled by a loud human voice, 
Do go on working while I talk. Don't stop! 
And I was caught upon the difficult choice--
To yield the last half hour of precious light, 
Or to stay on my knees, absurd and rude; 
I willed her to be gone with all my might, 
This kindly neighbor who destroyed a mood; 
I could not think of next spring any more, 
I had to re-assess the way I live. 
Long after I went in and closed the door, 
I pondered on the crude imperative. 

What it is to be caught up in each day 
Like a child fighting imaginary wars, 
Converting work into this passionate play, 
A rounded whole made up of different chores 
Which one might name haphazard meditation. 
And yet an unexpected call destroys 
Or puts to rout my primitive elation: 
Why be so serious about mere joys? 
Is this where some outmoded madness lies, 
Poet as recluse? No, what comes to me
Is how my father looked out of his eyes, 
And how he fought for his own passionate play.

He could tear up unread and throw away 
Communications from officialdom, 
And, courteous in every other way, 
Would not brook anything that kept him from 
Those lively dialogues with man's whole past 
That were his intimate and fruitful pleasure. 
Impetuous, impatient to the last, 
Be adamant, keep clear, strike for your treasure! 
I hear the youthful ardor in his voice
(And so I must forgive a self in labor). 
I feel his unrepentant smiling choice, 
(And so I ask forgiveness of my neighbor).





The Rain-Streaked Avenues of Central Queens
 

It ends badly, this glass of wine, 
before you drink it 
you have to drink a prior glass, 
before you sip you gulp, 
before you chug the bottle 
you pour it down your throat, 
before we lie together 
naked, we divorce, before we rest 
we grow old, it ends in chaos, 
               but it is delicious, 
when we wake it is the past, 
we are the faces staring 
from the high lit window, 
the unmet lovers, the rivals 
who do not exist, 
united in a radiance 
that will not fade at dawn.





Moose Dreams
 

There are times when all the chutzpa I 
can muster isn't enough, fug and bluster 
all I can do, and damned if it doesn't 
just stand there, legs straddling 
a berm of washboard dust-ruts 
and in late noon sun stare me 
blue in the face: lord, we could almost 
trade places, my back strained 
by the weight of those great bone wings, 
my tongue itching for lily root. 
And musk, lord, the pheromones, 
a day so sweet with elderberry's too rank 
fume I could die twice over snuffing. 
While the truck mumbles and a trout spanks 
the cooler, I almost outdo myself. 
But reason, that too-convenient shortcut, 
creeps back, if only so far: the rest as we say 
is silence, dust and the sputter of flies 
and when lumbering to go it pauses 
and throws me its last worst look 
its sorrow is Christ's, dewlap 
jeweled, a beatitude of moss.





Dogwood
 

Dog days doggone dog-tired dogwork of summer, 
mowing the grass we're all coming to 

the dog tags of you, me, I, we, stashed in a box, 
doghouse throwaways. Even the namesake 

tree whose blossoms some call Jesus-flowers 
for the rust-grooved tips of the petals 

as if nails now removed had indented 
the shape of a cross, betrays my mood 

how all those springs ago 
seeing our tree nailed with bloody after bloody 

crucifix I said this beauty's no foo-foo 
and sure enough my dog-weary dearie 

mowing today, the spring long gone, 
I brush a limb on whose tired leaves mites amble 

the edible thoroughfares and as if to confirm it, 
our neighbor's mutt runs along the fence yapping 

dogwood dogwood dogwood as the mower chugs on, 
our train leaving for the city beneath the grass.





Biographer
 

Authorized, booked 
By my steadfast prose 
The dead I ghost write 
Shed shadows that shine 
With hindsight, hearsay-- 
The last word is mine





La Porte
 

In the seam between day and night, wind 
                   ruts the dirt road and   
ruffles the milky way of dandelions. 

The young among them are greasy gold and urgent, 
                   while the old are balanced   
between growth and that burst past   

growing--annihilation, culmination   
                   of a beginning each has always been   
ending toward, admitting more and more   

space, until what's left is   
                   beyond color, a bleary truss 
of matter and air. Shocked   

accomplice of the rounding light,   
                   how you tremble in the stretch   
of your death, which is like all deaths,   

geometric with seed. Wind-swimmer, 
                   eye-floater, white nightgowned grandmother   
dancing your platelets on the head of this pin, 

can you show me how to wish,   
                   how to gather and scatter   
this single hooped breath?





Devotion: The Garment District
 

In bed as the machinery of morning begins, indistinguishable 
the subterranean turbines of the A train from the jet engine 
as it gins the clouds, rips and reseams the length of dungaree 
on its way to Pittsburgh (with the terrible and subtle cargoes, 
with ashes and a cat under the seat) from the pulleys 
of the service elevators from the baffled sound across the alley 
of the hand-iron press and the sewing machine motors whirring 
bobbins that stitch together the hot properties of Seoul   
      and the suburbs 
and the idiot village of Chelm, needle the veronica   
      and the Buddha robe 
and the sateen for spring. I looked over at her. Her skin a warp 
of Christ and a weft of meat. All night she had hauled me 
and the boy and the smoky, feckless men I was across 
the fens and stretches of mesquite through the tunnels 
and delivered me to my misery and the laborious knots of the sheets 
I wound myself in. And she was exhausted from Eros and swollen 
from anger. She could stand to put on a few pounds. I could see it 
in her ribs. Before I would marry my restlessness to her terror, 
before the crushes and wages could be made into our equity, before 
the endlessness would end in spinning jennies and sleaze   
      and the noise 
of a fleet of vehicles with tinted windows testing   
      the evacuation routes, 
I would cut, then peel, then dice, then caramelize some onions 
before she wasted away to nothing.





Devotion: The Burnt-Over District
 

Late fall in the villages of Pompey, Preble, Oran, Delphi Falls,   
      churched 
river and woods. In Homer and Ovid, the localities   
      and principalities 
of central New York, the hollows and corners of the   
      burnt-over districts 
visited by angels in the 1800's who led us to greatness: awakenings, 
gold, portents and lies, heaven, women's suffrage, and bundling 
with the other in the love beds while we waited for the lamb,   
the dove, the velvet of the ten-point buck grunting through   
      the underbrush 
to rut. We learned in divine time a year's a day.   
      We learned obedience 
and had charismatic children. And now the boy's an angelic 
eighteen days or six thousand years, as he leaves to serve. 
He did what we told him: blocked for punts--no one likes to   
      block for punts-- 
and when his friends crashed the truck in a ditch, he waited   
      for the cops 
and took the rap, nice kid, because he did the act of deliverance   
      one does 
in central New York and made the vows, pledged, testified,   
      and swore 
and participated in the sport greater than the coming of the dead, 
and escorted the exaggerated girl to the prom where he   
      was befuddled 
with organza and tulle and he did not forget the corsage, an orchid 
in a box he stared into: the white outer whorl and the inner whorl 
and pouted purple lip. He butterflied the pollen with the lashes   
      of his eyes. 
The flower was his terror. He was not meant to be the   
      indwelling beauty 
of things and surely he was not meant to be the wind in Iraq   
      with three others 
in his division and become the abstract shape of a god formed from a blood clot. 
I've seen the pictures, the vague shapes that ripple in the heat 
until I was terrified. It looked like he still moved. Remember fall 
in Delphi? All ardent and catastrophic and counter, elbows flailing, 
he ran in the flat places scraped from the gold hills and valleys.





There's Nothing More
 

There's nothing more 
erotic than 

one      red 

Chilean plum 
slumbered in 

the brown palm 
of the curved   

hand of the right   
man.





The History of Mothers of Sons
 

All sons sleep next to mothers, then alone, then with others 
Eventually, all our sons bare molars, incisors 
Meanwhile, mothers are wingless things in a room of stairs 
A gymnasium of bars and ropes, small arms hauling self over self 

Mothers hum nonsense, driving here 
and there (Here! There!) in hollow steeds, mothers reflecting 
how faint reflections shiver over the road 
All the deafening musts along the way 

Mothers favor the moon--hook-hung and mirroring the sun-- 
there, in a berry bramble, calm as a stone 

This is enough to wrench our hand out of his 
and simply devour him, though he exceeds even the tallest grass 

Every mother recalls a lullaby, and the elegy blowing through it





In the House of the Voice of Maria Callas
 

In the house of the voice of Maria Callas   
We hear the baby's cries, and the after-supper   
Rattle of silverware, and three clocks ticking   
To different tunes, and ripe plums   
Sleeping in their chipped bowl, and traffic sounds   
Dissecting the avenues outside.   We hear, like water   
Pouring over time itself, the pure distillate arias   
Of the numerous pampered queens who have reigned,   
And the working girls who have suffered   
The envious knives, and the breathless brides   
With their horned helmets who have fallen in love   
And gone crazy or fallen in love and died   
On the grand stage at their appointed moments--   
Who will sing of them now?   Maria Callas is dead,   
Although the full lips and the slanting eyes   
And flared nostrils of her voice resurrect   
Dramas we are able to imagine in this parlor   
On evenings like this one, adding some color,   
Adding some order.   Of whom it was said:   
She could imagine almost anything and give voice to it. 





In the House of Wax
 

I 

Far-sighted into yesterday 
they stand, gripping 
their charters and speeches, 
the presidents and kings, 
masters of unconscious evil. 

Their deputies are here -- 
judges, robed executioners, 
steely and triumphant. 

And stunned at their feet, 
the beheaded, the betrayed, 
healed and hallowed now 
in this grave sorrow of wax. 


       II 

We enter, adjust to the gloom, 
to the lighting that plays 
on the painted, staring faces. 

We think to ourselves, murmur 
to the one standing beside us: 
"How compellingly strange 
these people are, and yet familiar 
to the world we left behind us, 
the street and the household..." 

These are the people whose names 
we learned, whose lives we studied, 
whose thoughts we have become. 

Each lighted stage with its play 
of the lost and the violent -- 
comedians and stuntmen, 
heroes transfixed in purpose. 

We pause, to read once more, 
in deliberate, bald summation, 
what art, wax, and history 
have made of the dead: 

something more than a mirror, 
less than a telling likeness; 
an ideality slick with blood. 


       III 

How easily in the live heat 
of truth and summer 
these actors wilt and perish. 

Henry of Church and England 
is here, savage and senile, 
still laced in his armor; 
his lopped and stunted wives 
stand grouped around him. 

Bismark in his iron corset, 
endlessly dividing Europe; 
Wilhelm, that struttng dwarf, 
abject in abdication. 

And here, the fatal mischief 
of Sarajevo -- how swift a fire, 
how long a burning, came 
of the Archduke's festive ride, 
his shot and bloodied tunic. 

And no more telling prophecy 
in the wake of armistice 
than that one dated cartoon 
with its hooded sentry 
and its graveyard owl: 
"It has been six years..." 

How easily a puff of smoke, 
a square of burnt cloth, 
a shocked cry, can change 
the world, and leave it 
neither worse nor better. 


       IV 

Here is a man, thief or martyr, 
hanged at Damascus Gate 
with a hook through his gut. 

He swung, seared by the sun 
and kissed by the night. 
And maybe one of the market 
women brought him water, 
and maybe not -- once seen 
by the Sultan's watch, 
she might have lost her hands. 

As in the time of Richelieu, 
certain men the crown accused 
were exposed in iron baskets 
like plucked birds. 

They fouled their nests, 
starved and blackened until 
they died; and the city lived 
with their cries, their rank 
mortality, night and day. 

The hook is black and crescent, 
the body swings, inert, 
as if asleep and dreaming. 

The guidebook tells us the man 
survived his hook and lived; 
it doesn't say how long. 


       V 

Here, with his tins and furs, 
is Minuit, buying Manhattan. 
We see the Dutchman's flourish,   
the Indians' foolish feathers. 

He takes their land, and they 
his bitter gifts, his brass 
and trinkets -- so little cash 
in place of an earthy kingdom. 

Wolfe, Montcalm, on the plain 
below Quebec: the one dying, 
the other condemned to follow. 

We pass, reading from face to face, 
from book to book, uneasy 
that among these celebrations 
so many rigged transactions 
have gone unquestioned. 

And all our wigged colonials, 
our Franklins, conspiring 
with their strongbox keys 
and profitable lightning -- 

that so much ink and dust 
and shuffled paper conceals 
their tidy pilferings, 
their purity and blunted wrath. 

Were there rooms in this house, 
each with its tabled motions 
and false partitions 
might furnish a history, 
one slow truth at a time. 

But never in our late arrival 
have we stilled confusion, 
to learn how great a folly 
follows in the wake of fathers. 

From their deliberate violence 
we come to our own lamed 
misrule, its slick banality 
and crime without passion.   

To Ike, to Kennedy and Ford, 
golfers and temporizers; 
to perennial candidate Nixon, 
whose cheek was never turned. 

Out of his sleek arrest 
he steps towards us, 
as if to greet a voter -- 

a fixed, ferocious smile 
on the blue jowls 
brushed with powder. 


       VI 

Nothing we have painted 
and framed in our passage -- 
neither prayer nor courtship, 
nor solace of sleep 
and self -- escaped the grip 
of these iron centuries. 

Here, in a row of lighted 
cases, a few artifacts 
are on display. No comfort 
to us now in that familiar, 
edged interrogation... 

But the biting persuasion 
of chains and collars, 
of inching racks, fire tongs 
and screws -- in the eyes 
of kings and churchmen 
the instruments of truth. 

And whosoever might trespass, 
on whatever lawful ground, 
would find for his solace 
a more forbidding marriage. 

As once in a stone embrasure 
I saw a belt for virgins, 
a hinged and rusted clasp, 
with a lock, and a slit 
for functions -- all but one. 

Imagine with what shocked 
dismay a man might grope 
for his sweetness there, 
and all too soon awaken, 
clamped in his ecstasy. 


       VII 

Another room, 
with smaller people 
and thinner walls. 

Here the Queen plays 
with cryptic cards, 
hands out assignments: 

"You are the Hunchback," 
she says, "and You 
the Hangman, and You 
the Jack of Trades." 

She pares and quarters 
her venomous apple, 
calls for her mirror, 
and her image smiles 
to watch her glass 
fill up with poison. 

Beauty is sleeping, 
the Prince is awake, 
and far in the forest 
a frostlight winks 
from the Sugar House. 

The Witch is singing 
and lighting her oven. 
The Woodcutter's 
wayward children watch, 
they break and nibble 
the sweetened glass. 

The images whisper 
and darken, conspiring 
in their tumbled tale 
of fretful spinners, 
of drones and dumble- 
dores, wise eggs 
that speak and shatter. 

And it looks as if 
the painted sleepers 
in this dreamworks 
are about to awaken: 

the crafty Queen 
and her players, 
the musical mice, 
the drones 
and the spinners -- 

All in a scampering 
rush, to find 
the nearest exit... 

As the looking glass 
draws us deeper 
into the bright play 
of shadows that melt 
and run and freeze... 

The mad, mad romp 
of children, of rabbits 
and dwarfs, who keep 
their strange hilarity 
in so much horror. 


       VIII 

Call those from underneath, 
the sold and trodden, 
their slow and sweating sons, 
elevate and crown them. 

Patch up their clothing 
and wash their skins, 
rub their faces 
until they glow, 
and their dull eyes brighten. 

Give them speeches to learn, 
and eloquent gestures, 
power to grasp, 
laws to break and mend. 

Great heat and furious labor 
bring on in them 
this drear and mystical change: 

At first a swinish fattening, 
and then a leaner look, 
and in their eyes 
the same feral glitter 
of their late unkindly masters. 

They sicken as they flourish, 

until like wickless candles 
they slump and totter; 
their heads are rotten, 
their famous flesh 
has run to sticky pools. 

They die and sleep afoot, 
their ignorant hearts 
grown wise in the ways of wax. 


       IX 

In all these wax memorials 
only appearance changes. 

Crowned heads and axes fall, 
thugs and jailors rise 
and displace each other 
in this long, uneasy walk 
we have littered 
with claims and captions. 

The heroes are always welcomed, 
are propped and shaven, 
their ruddy male composure 
is sleeker than ever, 
though the great sleeves 
and brutal collars 
give way to softer buttons. 

The paper in official hands 
rustles as before, 
though it is only paper, 
paper in cheap supply, 
and not the bleached fell 
of a difficult sheep. 

And yet the neat persuasions   
are seen to tighten, 
and each new litigation 
is a running noose... 

All that increases, 
all that gluts and fattens, 
matures its option here: 
Honor to thieves and merchants, 
long life to the butcher. 

And for the just petitioner -- 
sweeper of the hallways, scapegoat 
and discard -- no reply 
but the rote of legal fictions; 

to which he listens, now 
as in the days of Pontinus, 
stricken with understanding. 


       X 

The rooms are large and numerous, 
and we in our restless striding 
find that they never end. 

It is as if we had lived here 
always, captive to this endless 
and malign instruction; 
had served those mighty tempers, 
and learned too well 
these never-blotted names. 

And we live here still, 
sharing these murderous spaces, 
this blood-haunted silence. 

And once we started from sleep, 
terrorized and whimpering, 
to see in the luminous, 
sunken light, the head 
of a long-forgotten agent: 

a face like a father, 
one who might have comforted, 
but cannot see or hear us: 
bald, vacant, and amused. 


       XI 

All is as it must or might be, 
here at the story's end -- 
the jury dismissed, the witness 
excused, and all are guilty. 

To have come so far, walked 
so easily through so much anguish, 
pride, and stupor of evil, 
and yet we are standing still, 
locked in an echoing foyer. 

In so driven, so brief an itinerary, 
a day will stand for a decade, 
an inch for a mile -- so far 
has a painted fiction served us. 

These bones in their period costumes 
would bend if we touched them; 
their flesh would yield, 
and all arrangements topple. 

But see how they bring toward us 
the old, sustaining gestures -- 
a stride, an arm outstretched -- 
the furrows in the smiles 
deepen, and the red lips smear. 

Great captains command, obedient 
ranks go down. In all these propped 
assemblies I know a substance 
neither wax nor wholly flesh -- 
a tried and mortal nature, 
familiar as the warmth in my hand. 


       XII 

Were we not lost, condemned 
to repeat these names 
and to honor their crimes, 
a voice among us might cry out, 
speak to those who are 
stopped here: 
                     Whose faces are these 
that melt and run? 

Children and guardians, giants 
and dwarfs -- 
                   Oh, people, people... 
Who are these heroes 
and where are their victims? 

We who are standing here 
with our guidebooks suddenly closed 
and all the exits darkened... 

Until another gallery opens, 
or the sun through that skylight 
strikes us all -- 
                     souls in torment, 
pilgrims and doting fathers...





Before Completion
 

1    I gaze through a telescope at the Orion Nebula, 
      a blue vapor with a cluster of white stars, 
      gaze at the globular cluster in Hercules, 
      needle and pinpoint lights stream into my eyes. 
      A woman puts a baby in a plastic bag 
      and places it in a dumpster; someone 
      parking a car hears it cry and rescues it. 
      Is this the little o, the earth? 
      Deer at dusk are munching apple blossoms; 
      a green snake glides down flowing acequia water. 
      The night is rich with floating pollen; 
      in the morning, we break up the soil 
      to prepare for corn. Fossilized cotton pollen 
      has been discovered at a site above six thousand feet. 
      As the character yi, change, is derived 
      from the skin of a chameleon, we are 
      living the briefest hues on the skin 
      of the world. I gaze at the Sombrero Galaxy 
      between Corvus and Spica: on a night with no moon, 
      I notice my shadow by starlight. 


2    Where does matter end and space begin? 
       
      blue jays eating suet; 

      juggling three crumbled newspaper balls 
      wrapped with duct tape; 

      tasseling corn; 

      the gravitational bending of light; 

      "We're dying; 

      stringing a coral necklace; 

      he drew his equations on butcher paper; 

      vanishing in sunlight; 

      sobbing; 

      she folded five hundred paper cranes and placed them in a 
          basket; 

      sleeping in his room in a hammock; 

      they drew a shell to represent zero; 

      red persimmons; 

      what is it like to catch up to light? 

      he threw Before Completion: 
      six in the third place, nine in the sixth. 


3    A wavering line of white-faced ibises, 
      flying up the Rio Grande, disappears. 
      A psychic says, "Search a pawnshop 

      for the missing ring. Loss, a black hole. 
      You do not intend to commit a series of 
      blunders, but to discover in one error 

      an empty cocoon. A weaver dumps 
      flashlight batteries into a red-dye bath. 
      A physicist says, "After twenty years, 

      nothing is as I thought it would be. 
      You recollect watching a yellow- 
      and-black-banded caterpillar in a jar 

      form a chrysalis: in days the chrysalis 
      lightened and became transparent: 
      a monarch emerged and flexed its wings. 

      You are startled to retrieve what you forgot: 
      it has the crunching sound of river 
      breakup when air is calm and very clear.   


4    Beijing, 1985: a poet describes herding pigs 
      beside a girl with a glass eye and affirms 
      the power to dream and transform. Later, 
      in exile, he axes his wife and hangs himself. 
      Do the transformations of memory 
      become the changing lines of divination? 
      Is the continuum of a moment a red 
      poppy blooming by a fence, or is it 
      a woman undergoing radiation treatment 
      who stretches out on a bed to rest 
      and senses she is stretching out to die? 
      At night I listen to your breathing, 
      guess at the freckles on your arms, 
      smell your hair at the back of your neck. 
      Tiger lilies are budding in pots in the patio; 
      daikon is growing deep in the garden. 
      I see a bewildered man ask for direction, 
      and a daikon picker points the way with a daikon. 


5    He threw Duration; 

      sunspots; 

      what is it like to catch up to light? 

      a collapsing vertebra; 

      the folding wings of a blue dragonfly; 

      receiving a fax; 

      buffeted on a floatplane between islands; 

      a peregrine falcon making a slow circle with outstretched 
          wings; 

      he crumpled papers, threw them on the floor, 
      called it City of Bums; 

      polar aligning; 

      inhaling the smell of her hair; 

      a red handprint on a sandstone wall; 

      digging up ginseng; 

      carding wool; 

      where does matter end and space begin? 


6    Mushroom hunting at the ski basin, I spot 
      a blood-red amanita pushing up under fir, 
      find a white-gilled Man On Horseback, 
      notice dirt breaking and carefully unearth 
      a cluster of gold chanterelles. I stop 
      and gaze at yellow light in a clearing. 
      As grief dissolves and the mind begins to clear, 
      an s twist begins to loosen the z twisted fiber. 
      A spider asleep under a geranium leaf 
      may rest a leg on the radial string of a web, 
      but cool nights are pushing nasturtiums to bloom. 
      An eggplant deepens in hue and drops to the ground. 
      Yellow specks of dust float in the clearing; 
      in memory, a series of synchronous spaces. 
      As a cotton fiber burns in an s twist 
      and unravels the z twist of its existence, 
      the mind unravels and ravels a wave of light, 
      persimmons ripening on leafless trees.





The Opal
 

Nailing up chicken wire on the frame house, 
or using a chalk line, or checking a level at a glance 
gets to be easy. 
                        We install double-pane windows 
pressurized with argon between the panes 
for elevations over 4500. 
                                       And use pick and shovel 
to dig for the footing for the annex. Lay cinder blocks, 
and check levels. Pour the cement floor, and 
use wood float and steel trowel to finish the surface 
as it sets. 
                Nailing into rough, dense, knotted 
two-by-twelves, or using a chalk line to mark the locations 
of the fire blocks, or checking the level of a 
stained eight-by-ten window header gets to be 
easier. 
          In nailing up chicken wire, we know 
how to cut for the canal, pull the wire up over the 
fire wall, make cuts for the corners, tuck it 
around back, and nail two-head nails into the stud. 
And when the footing is slightly uneven and we are 
laying a first row of cinder blocks, know that a 
small pebble under a corner often levels the top 
to the row. 
                And, starting on rock lath, the various 
stages of a house - cutting vigas, cleaning aspens for 
latillas, installing oak doors, or plastering the 
adobe wall - are facets of a cut opal.





The Negative
 

A man hauling coal in the street is stilled forever. 
Inside a temple, instead of light 

a slow shutter lets the darkness in. 
I see a rat turn a corner running from a man with a chair trying to smash it, 

see people sleeping at midnight in a Wuhan street on bamboo beds, 
a dead pig floating, bloated, on water. 

I see a photograph of a son smiling who two years ago fell off a cliff 
and his photograph is in each room of the apartment. 

I meet a woman who had smallpox as a child, was abandoned by her mother 
but who lived, now has two daughters, a son, a son-in-law; 

they live in three rooms and watch a color television. 
I see a man in blue work clothes whose father was a peasant 

who joined the Communist party early but by the time of the Cultural Revolution 
had risen in rank and become a target of the Red Guards. 

I see a woman who tried to kill herself with an acupuncture needle 
but instead hit a vital point and cured her chronic asthma. 

A Chinese poet argues that the fundamental difference between East and West 
is that in the East an individual does not believe himself 

in control of his fate but yields to it. 
As a negative reverses light and dark 

these words are prose accounts of personal tragedy becoming metaphor, 
an emulsion of silver salts sensitive to light, 

laughter in the underground bomb shelter converted into a movie theater, 
lovers in the Summer Palace park.





Ten Thousand to One
 

The Phoenicians guarded a recipe that required 
ten thousand murex shells to make 
an ounce of Tyrian purple. 

Scan the surface of Aldebaran with a radio wave; 
grind lapis lazuli 
into ultramarine. 

Search the summer sky for an Anasazi turkey constellation; 
see algae under an electron microscope 
resemble a Magellanic Cloud. 

A chemist tried to convert benzene into quinine, 
but blundered into a violet 
aniline dye instead. 

Have you ever seen maggots feed on a dead rat? 
Listen to a red-tailed hawk glide 
over the hushed spruce and 

pines in a canyon. Feel a drop of water roll 
down a pine needle, and glisten, 
hanging, at the tip.





Shooting Star
 

1    In a concussion, 
      the mind severs the pain: 
      you don't remember flying off a motorcycle, 
      and landing face first 
      in a cholla. 

      But a woman stabbed in her apartment, 
      by a prowler searching for 
      money and drugs, 
      will never forget her startled shriek 
      die in her throat, 
      blood soaking into the floor. 

      The quotidian violence of the world 
      is like a full moon rising over the Ortiz mountains; 
      its pull is everywhere. 
      But let me live a life of violent surprise 
      and startled joy. I want to 
      thrust a purple iris into your hand, 
      give you a sudden embrace. 

      I want to live as Wang Hsi-chih lived 
      writing characters in gold ink on black silk-- 
      not to frame on a wall, 
      but to live the splendor now. 


2    Deprived of sleep, she hallucinated 
      and, believing she had sold the genetic 
      research on carp, signed a confession. 
      Picking psilocybin mushrooms in the mountains 

      of Veracruz, I hear tin cowbells 
      in the slow rain, see men wasted on pulque 
      sitting under palm trees. Is it 
      so hard to see things as they truly are: 

      a route marked in red ink on a map, 
      the shadows of apricot leaves thrown 
      in wind and sun on a wall? It is 
      easy to imagine a desert full of agaves 

      and golden barrel cactus, red earth, a red sun. 
      But to truly live one must see things 
      as they are, as they might become: 
      a wrench is not a fingerprint 

      on a stolen car, nor baling wire 
      the undertow of the ocean. I may hallucinate, 
      but see the men in drenched clothes 
      as men who saw and saw and refuse to see. 


3    Think of being a judge or architect 
      or trombonist, and do not worry whether 
      thinking so makes it so. I overhear 
      two men talking in another room; 

      I cannot transcribe the conversation 
      word for word, but know if they are 
      vexed or depressed, joyful or nostalgic. 
      An elm leaf floats on a pond. 

      Look, a child wants to be a cardiologist 
      then a cartographer, but wanting so 
      does not make it so. It is not 
      a question of copying out the Heart Sutra 

      in your own blood on an alabaster wall. 
      It is not a question of grief or joy. 
      But as a fetus grows and grows, 
      as the autumn moon ripens the grapes, 

      greed and cruelty and hunger for power 
      ripen us, enable us to grieve, act, 
      laugh, shriek, see, see it all as 
      the water on which the elm leaf floats. 


4    Write out the memories of your life 
      in red-gold disappearing ink, so that it all 
      dies, no lives. Each word you speak 
      dies, no lives. Is it all 
      at once in the mind? I once stepped 
      on a sea urchin, used a needle to dig out 
      the purple spines; blood soaked my hands. 
      But one spine was left, and I carried 
      it a thousand miles. I saw then 
      the olive leaves die on the branch, 
      saw dogs tear flesh off a sheep's corpse. 
      To live at all is to grieve; 
      but, once, to have it all at once 
      is to see a shooting star: shooting star 
      shooting star.





Streamers
 

1    As an archaeologist unearths a mask with opercular teeth 
      and abalone eyes, someone throws a broken fan and extension 
          cords 
      into a dumpster. A point of coincidence exists in the mind 

      resembling the tension between a denotation and its stretch 
      of definition: aurora: a luminous phenomenon consisting 
      of streamers or arches of light appearing in the upper 
          atmosphere 

      of a planet's polar regions, caused by the emission of light 
      from atoms excited by electrons accelerated along the planet's 
      magnetic field lines. The mind's magnetic field lines. 

      When the red shimmering in the huge dome of sky stops, 
      a violet flare is already arcing up and across, while a man 
      foraging a dumpster in Cleveland finds some celery and   
          charred fat. 

      Hunger, angst: the blue shimmer of emotion, water speeding 
      through a canyon; to see only to know: to wake finding 
      a lug nut, ticket stub, string, personal card, ink smear, $2.76. 


2    A Kwiakiutl wooden dish with a double-headed wolf 
      is missing from a museum collection. And as 

      the director checks to see if it was deaccessioned, 
      a man sitting on a stool under bright lights 

      shouts: a pachinko ball dropped vertiginously 
      but struck a chiming ring and ricocheted to the left. 

      We had no sense that a peony was opening, 
      that a thousand white buds of a Kyoto camellia 

      had opened at dusk and had closed at dawn. 
      When the man steps out of the pachinko parlor, 

      he will find himself vertiginously dropping 
      in starless space. When he discovers 

      that his daughter was cooking over smoking oil 
      and shrieked in a fatal asthma attack, 

      he will walk the bright streets in an implosion of grief, 
      his mind will become an imploding star, 

      he will know he is searching among bright gold threads 
      for a black pattern in the weave. 


3    Set a string loop into a figure of two diamonds,   
      four diamonds, one diamond: 
      as a woman tightens her hand into a fist 
      and rubs it in a circular motion over her heart, 
      a bewildered man considering the semantics of set 
      decides no through-line exists: 

      to sink the head of a nail below the surface, 
      to fix as a distinguishing imprint, sign, or appearance, 
      to incite, put on a fine edge by grinding, 
      to adjust, adorn, put in motion, make unyielding, 
      to bend slightly the tooth points of a saw 
      alternately in opposite directions. 

      As the woman using her index finger makes 
      spiral after spiral from her aorta up over her head, 
      see the possibilities for transcendence: 
      you have to die and die in your mind 
      before you can begin to see the empty spaces 
      the configuration of string defines. 


4    A restorer examines the pieces of a tin chandelier, 
      and notices the breaks in the arms are along 
      old solder lines, and that cheap epoxy was used. 

      He will have to scrape off the epoxy, scrub some flux, 
      heat up the chandelier and use a proper solder. 
      A pair of rough-legged hawks are circling over a pasture; 

      one hawk cuts off the rabbit's path of retreat 
      while the other swoops with sharp angle and curve of wings. 
      Cirrus, cirrostratus, cirrocumulus, altostratus, 

      altocumulus, stratocumulus, nimbostratus, 
      cumlus, cumulonimbus, stratus: is there no end? 
      Memories stored in the body begin to glow. 

      A woman seals basil in brown bags and hangs them 
      from the ceiling. A dead sturgeon washes to shore. 
      The sun is at the horizon, but another sun 

      is rippling in water. It's not that the angle 
      of reflection equals the angle of incidence, 
      but there's exultation, pleasure, distress, death, love. 


5    The world resembles a cuttlefish changing colors 
      and shimmering. An apprentice archer has 

      stretched the bowstring properly, but does not know 
      he will miss the target because he is not aiming in the hips. 

      He will learn to hit the target without aiming 
      when he has died in his mind. I am not scared of death, 

      though I am appalled at how obsession with security 
      yields a pin-pushing, pencil-shaving existence. 

      You can descend to the swimming level of sharks, 
      be a giant kelp growing from the ocean bottom up 

      to the surface light, but the critical moment 
      is to die feeling the infinite stillness of the passions, 

      to revel in the touch of hips, hair, lips, hands, 
      feel the collapse of space in December light. 

      When I know I am no longer trying to know the spectral lines 
      of the earth, I can point to a cuttlefish and say, 

      "Here it is sepia, already it is deep-brown, 
      and exult, "Here it is deep-brown, already it is white. 


6    Red koi swim toward us, and black 
      carp are rising out of the depths of the pond, 
      but our sustenance is a laugh, a grief, 

      a walk at night in the snow, 
      seeing the pure gold of a flickering candle - 
      a moment at dusk when we see 

      that deer have been staring at us, 
      we did not see them edge out of the brush, 
      a moment when someone turns on a light 

      and turns a window into a mirror, 
      a moment when a child asks, 
      "When will it be tomorrow? 

      To say "A bell cannot be red and violet 
      at the same place and time because 
      of the logical structure of color is true 

      but is a dot that must enlarge into 
      a zero: a void, enso, red shimmer, 
      breath, endless beginning, pure body, pure mind.





The Redshifting Web
 

1    The dragons on the back of a circular bronze mirror 
      swirl without end. I sit and am an absorbing form: 
      I absorb the outline of a snowy owl on a branch, 
      the rigor mortis in a hand. I absorb the crunching sounds 
      when you walk across a glacial lake with aquamarine 
      ice heaved up here and there twenty feet high. 
      I absorb the moment a jeweler pours molten gold 
      into a cuttlefish mold and it begins to smoke. 
      I absorb the weight of a pause when it tilts 
      the conversation in a room. I absorb the moments 
      he sleeps holding her right breast in his left hand 
      and know it resembles glassy waves in a harbor 
      in descending spring light. Is the mind a mirror? 
      I see pig carcasses piled up from the floor 
      on a boat docked at Wanxian and the cook 
      who smokes inadvertently drops ashes into soup. 
      I absorb the stench of burning cuttlefish bone, 
      and as moments coalesce see to travel far is to return. 


2    A cochineal picker goes blind; 

      Mao, swimming across the Yangtze River, 
      was buoyed by underwater frogmen; 

      in the nursing home, 
      she yelled, "Everyone here has Alzheimer's! 

      it blistered his mouth; 

      they thought the tape of erhu solos was a series of spy messages; 

      finding a bag of piki pushpinned to the door; 

      shapes of saguaros by starlight; 

      a yogi tries on cowboy boots at a flea market; 

      a peregrine falcon 
      shears off a wing; 

      her niece went through the house and took what she wanted; 

      "The sooner the better; 

      like a blindman grinding the bones of a snow leopard; 

      she knew you had come to cut her hair; 

      suffering: this and that: 
      iron 26, gold 79; 

      they dared him to stare at the annular eclipse; 

      the yellow pupils of a saw-whet owl. 


3    The gold shimmer at the beginning of summer 
      dissolves in a day. A fly mistakes a 
      gold spider, the size of a pinhead, at the center 
      of a glistening web. A morning mushroom 
      knows nothing of twilight and dawn? 
      Instead of developing a navy, Ci Xi 
      ordered architects to construct a two-story 
      marble boat that floats on a lotus-covered lake. 
      Mistake a death cap for Caesar's amanita 
      and in hours a hepatic hole opens into the sky. 
      To avoid yelling at his pregnant wife, 
      a neighbor installs a boxing bag in a storeroom; 
      he periodically goes in, punches, punches, 
      reappears and smiles. A hummingbird moth 
      hovers and hovers at a woman wearing a   
      cochineal-dyed flowery dress. Liu Hansheng 
      collects hypodermic needles, washes them 
      under a hand pump, dries them in sunlight, 
      seals them in Red Cross plastic bags, 
      resells them as sterilized new ones to hospitals. 


4    Absorb a corpse-like silence and be a brass 
      cone at the end of a string beginning 
      to mark the x of stillness. You may puzzle 
      as to why a meson beam oscillates, or why 
      galaxies appear to be simultaneously redshifting 
      in all directions, but do you stop to sense 
      death pulling and pulling from the center 
      of the earth to the end of the string? 
      A mother screams at her son, "You're so stupid, 
      but the motion of this anger is a circle. 
      A teen was going to attend a demonstration, 
      but his parents, worried about tear gas, 
      persuaded him to stay home: he was bludgeoned 
      to death that afternoon by a burglar. 
      I awake dizzy with a searing headache   
      thinking what nightmare did I have 
      that I cannot remember only to discover 
      the slumlord dusted the floor with roach powder. 


5    Moored off Qingdao, before sunrise, 
      the pilot of a tanker is selling dismantled bicycles. 
      Once, a watchmaker coated numbers on the dial 

      with radioactive paint and periodically 
      straightened the tip of the brush in his mouth. 
      Our son sights the North Star through a straw 

      taped to a protractor so that a bolt 
      dangling from a string marks the latitude. 
      I remember when he said his first word, "Clock; 

      his 6:02 is not mine, nor is your 7:03 his. 
      We visit Aurelia in the nursing home and find 
      she is sleeping curled in a fetal position. 

      A chain-smoking acupuncturist burps, curses; 
      a teen dips his head in paint thinner. 
      We think, had I this then that would, 

      but subjunctive form is surge and ache. 
      Yellow dips of chamisa are flaring open. 
      I drop a jar of mustard, and it shatters in a wave. 


6    The smell of roasted chili; 

      descending into the epilimnion; 

      the shape of a datura leaf; 

      a bank robber superglued his fingertips; 

      in the lake, 
      ocean-seal absorption; 

      a moray snaps up a scorpion fish; 

      he had to mistake and mistake; 

      burned popcorn; 

      he lifted the fly agaric off of blue paper 
      and saw a white galaxy; 

      sitting in a cold sweat; 

      a child drinking Coke out of a formula bottle 
      has all her teeth capped in gold; 

      chrysanthemum-shaped fireworks exploding over the water; 

      red piki passed down a ladder; 

      laughter; 

      as a lobster mold transforms a russula into a delicacy; 

      replicating an Anasazi 
      yucca fiber and turkey-feather blanket. 


7    He looks at a series of mirrors: Warring States 
      Western Han, Eastern Han, Tang, Song, 
      and notices bits of irregular red corrosion 

      on the Warring States mirror. On the back, 
      three dragons swirl in mist and April air. 
      After sixteen years that first kiss 

      still has a flaring tail. He looks at the TLV 
      pattern on the back of the Han mirror: 
      the mind has diamond points east, south, west, north. 

      He grimaces and pulls up a pile of potatoes, 
      notices snow clouds coming in from the west. 
      She places a sunflower head on the northwest 

      corner of the fence. He looks at the back   
      of the Tang mirror: the lion and grape 
      pattern is so wrought he turns, watches her 

      pick eggplant, senses the underlying 
      twist of pleasure and surprise that 
      in mind they flow and respond endlessly. 


8    I find a rufous hummingbird on the floor 
      of a greenhouse, sense a redshifting 
      along the radial string of a web. 
      You may draw a cloud pattern in cement 
      setting in a patio, or wake to 
      sparkling ferns melting on a windowpane. 
      The struck, plucked, bowed, blown 
      sounds of the world come and go. 
      As first light enters a telescope 
      and one sees light of a star when the star 
      has vanished, I see a finch at a feeder, 
      beans germinating in darkness; 
      a man with a pole pulls yarn out 
      of an indigo vat, twists and untwists it; 
      I hear a shout as a child finds Boletus 
      barrowsii under ponderosa pine; 
      I see you wearing an onyx-and-gold pin. 
      In curved space, is a line a circle? 


9    Pausing in the motion of a stroke, 
      two right hands 
      grasping a brush; 

          staring through a skylight 
          at a lunar eclipse; 

      a great blue heron; 
      wings flapping, 
      landing on the rail of a float house; 

          near and far: 
          a continuous warp; 

      a neighbor wants to tear down this fence; 
      a workman covets it 
      for a trastero; 

          raccoons on the rooftop 
          eating apricots; 

      the character xuan - 
      dark, dyed - 
      pinned to a wall above a computer; 

          lovers making 
          a room glow; 

      weaving on a vertical loom: 
      sound of a comb, 
      baleen; 

          hiding a world in a world: 
          1054, a supernova.





Slam, Dunk, & Hook
 

Fast breaks. Lay ups. With Mercury's 
Insignia on our sneakers, 
We outmaneuvered to footwork 
Of bad angels. Nothing but a hot 
Swish of strings like silk 
Ten feet out. In the roundhouse 
Labyrinth our bodies 
Created, we could almost 
Last forever, poised in midair 
Like storybook sea monsters. 
A high note hung there 
A long second. Off 
The rim. We'd corkscrew 
Up & dunk balls that exploded 
The skullcap of hope & good 
Intention. Lanky, all hands 
& feet...sprung rhythm. 
We were metaphysical when girls 
Cheered on the sidelines. 
Tangled up in a falling, 
Muscles were a bright motor 
Double-flashing to the metal hoop 
Nailed to our oak. 
When Sonny Boy's mama died 
He played nonstop all day, so hard 
Our backboard splintered. 
Glistening with sweat, 
We rolled the ball off 
Our fingertips. Trouble 
Was there slapping a blackjack 
Against an open palm. 
Dribble, drive to the inside, 
& glide like a sparrow hawk. 
Lay ups. Fast breaks. 
We had moves we didn't know 
We had. Our bodies spun 
On swivels of bone & faith, 
Through a lyric slipknot 
Of joy, & we knew we were 
Beautiful & dangerous.





Elegy
 

I am writing now in preconceptions 

Those of sex and ropes 

Many frantic cruelties occur to the flesh of the 
          
            imagination 

And the imagination does have flesh to destroy 

And the flesh has imagination to sever 

The mouth is just a body filled with imagination 

Can you imagine its contents 

The dripping into a bucket 

And its acts 

The ellipses and chaining apart 

The feather 

The observer 


The imagination, bare, has nothing to confirm it 

There's just the singing of the birds 

The sounds of the natural scream 

A strange example 

The imagination wishes to be embraced by freedom 

It is laid bare in order to be desired 

But the imagination must keep track of the flesh 
          
            responding--its increments of awareness--a 
          
            slow progression 

It must be beautiful and it can't be free 




                     -for John Zorn, after his "Elegy





We Never Know
 

He danced with tall grass 
for a moment, like he was swaying 
with a woman. Our gun barrels 
glowed white-hot. 
When I got to him, 
a blue halo 
of flies had already claimed him. 
I pulled the crumbled photograph 
from his fingers. 
There's no other way 
to say this: I fell in love. 
The morning cleared again, 
except for a distant mortar 
& somewhere choppers taking off. 
I slid the wallet into his pocket 
& turned him over, so he wouldn't be 
kissing the ground.





The Children
 

In three directions 
are two storms. 
I instruct the edges 
of my hands to become 
irises, to shatter 
in that way, 
in three directions. 
There's nothing behind me. 

Viols 
claw beneath our fences 
at the elevation 
of sound to pure 
unsanctity, the moment 
of simultaneity: 
airplanes seeming to collide and not colliding, the crow alighting 
in the manner of a seabird, the carbomb a more than momentary poppy. 

The bad total 
of death points one 
direction. 
It moves 
at the edge of my hand 
at the memorial service, 
viols useless now 
laid across their breasts, 
the attitude of submission.   

I was eating dinner in a tall room. I was the third guest. 
I felt a tightening in my asshole, and the yellow wine turned 
to red, turned to your hand on another's woven onto tapestry. 
How the month of June became our sons, so many bridges for one 
river, was the story always delighted you. 

The carbomb was faster. 
Simultaneous with the iris the viol 
shatters in three directions. 
Everything I have taken 
claws helplessly at sunlight 
that won't defend itself. 
The red one is the poppy.





Song: "It was a lover and his lass
 

(from As You Like It)
It was a lover and his lass, 
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 
That o'er the green cornfield did pass, 
   In springtime, the only pretty ring time, 
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; 
Sweet lovers love the spring. 

Between the acres of the rye, 
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 
Those pretty country folks would lie, 
   In springtime, the only pretty ring time, 
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; 
Sweet lovers love the spring. 

This carol they began that hour, 
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 
How that a life was but a flower 
   In springtime, the only pretty ring time, 
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; 
Sweet lovers love the spring. 

And therefore take the present time, 
   With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 
For love is crownd with the prime 
   In springtime, the only pretty ring time, 
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; 
Sweet lovers love the spring.





To Jane: The Invitation
 

Best and brightest, come away!

Fairer far than this fair Day,

Which, like thee to those in sorrow,

Comes to bid a sweet good-morrow

To the rough Year just awake

In its cradle on the brake.

The Brightest hour of unborn Spring,

Through the winter wandering,

Found, it seems, the halcyon Morn

To hoar February born.

Bending from Heaven, in azure mirth,

It kissed the forehead of the Earth,

And smiled upon the silent sea,

And bade the frozen streams be free,

And waked to music all their fountains,

And breathed upon the frozen mountains,

And like a prophetess of May

Strewed flowers upon the barren way,

Making the wintry world appear

Like one on whom thou smilest, dear.

Away, away, from men and towns,

To the wild wood and the downs--

To the silent wilderness

Where the soul need not repress

Its music lest it should not find

An echo in another's mind.

While the touch of Nature's art

Harmonizes heart to heart.

I leave this notice on my door

For each accustomed visitor:--

I am gone into the fields

To take what this sweet hour yields;--

Reflection, you may come tomorrow,

Sit by the fireside with Sorrow.--

You with the unpaid bill, Despair,--

You, tiresome verse-reciter, Care,--

I will pay you in the grave,--

Death will listen to your stave.

Expectation too, be off!

Today is for itself enough;

Hope, in pity mock not Woe

With smiles, nor follow where I go;

Long having lived on thy sweet food,

At length I find one moment's good

After long pain--with all your love,

This you never told me of.


Radiant Sister of the Day,

Awake! arise! And come away!

To the wild woods and the plains,

And the pools where winter rains

Image all their roof of leaves,

Where the pine its garland weaves

Of sapless green, and ivy dun

Round stems that never kiss the sun:

Where the lawns and pastures be,

And the sandhills of the sea:--

Where the melting hoar-frost wets

The daisy-star that never sets,

And wind-flowers, and violets,

Which yet join not scent to hue,

Crown the pale year weak and new;

When the night is left behind

In the deep east, dun and blind,

And the blue noon is over us,

And the multitudinous

Billows murmur at our feet,

Where the earth and ocean meet,

And all things seem only one

In the universal sun.








Stanzas ["Oh, come to me in dreams, my love!"]
 

Oh, come to me in dreams, my love!
   I will not ask a dearer bliss;
Come with the starry beams, my love,
   And press mine eyelids with thy kiss.

'Twas thus, as ancient fables tell,
   Love visited a Grecian maid,
Till she disturbed the sacred spell,
   And woke to find her hopes betrayed.

But gentle sleep shall veil my sight,
   And Psyche's lamp shall darkling be,
When, in the visions of the night,
   Thou dost renew thy vows to me.

Then come to me in dreams, my love,
   I will not ask a dearer bliss;
Come with the starry beams, my love,
   And press mine eyelids with thy kiss.







Loves Philosophy
 

The fountains mingle with the river 
   And the rivers with the ocean, 
The winds of heaven mix for ever 
   With a sweet emotion; 
Nothing in the world is single; 
   All things by a law divine 
In one spirit meet and mingle. 
   Why not I with thine?-- 

See the mountains kiss high heaven 
   And the waves clasp one another; 
No sister-flower would be forgiven 
   If it disdained its brother; 
And the sunlight clasps the earth 
   And the moonbeams kiss the sea: 
What is all this sweet work worth 
   If thou kiss not me? 







First Love
 

I ne'er was struck before that hour 
   With love so sudden and so sweet, 
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower 
   And stole my heart away complete. 
My face turned pale as deadly pale, 
   My legs refused to walk away, 
And when she looked, what could I ail? 
   My life and all seemed turned to clay. 

And then my blood rushed to my face 
   And took my eyesight quite away, 
The trees and bushes round the place 
   Seemed midnight at noonday. 
I could not see a single thing, 
   Words from my eyes did start-- 
They spoke as chords do from the string, 
   And blood burnt round my heart. 

Are flowers the winter's choice? 
   Is love's bed always snow? 
She seemed to hear my silent voice, 
   Not love's appeals to know.
I never saw so sweet a face 
   As that I stood before. 
My heart has left its dwelling-place 
   And can return no more. 






My Lifes Delight
 

Come, O come, my life's delight,
   Let me not in languor pine!
Love loves no delay; thy sight,
   The more enjoyed, the more divine:
O come, and take from me
The pain of being deprived of thee!

Thou all sweetness dost enclose,
   Like a little world of bliss.
Beauty guards thy looks: the rose
   In them pure and eternal is.
Come, then, and make thy flight
As swift to me, as heavenly light.







To -
 

Had I a man's fair form, then might my sighs

   Be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell

   Thine ear, and find thy gentle heart; so well

   Would passion arm me for the enterprise;

   But ah! I am no knight whose foeman dies;

   No cuirass glistens on my bosom's swell;

   I am no happy shepherd of the dell

   Whose lips have trembled with a maiden's eyes.

   Yet must I dote upon thee--call thee sweet,

   Sweeter by far than Hybla's honied roses

   When steep'd in dew rich to intoxication.

   Ah! I will taste that dew, for me tis meet,

   And when the moon her pallid face discloses,

   I'll gather some by spells, and incantation. 








Night of Love
 

The moon has left the sky, love, 
The stars are hiding now, 
And frowning on the world, love, 
Night bares her sable brow. 

The snow is on the ground, love, 
And cold and keen the air is. 
I'm singing here to you, love;   
You're dreaming there in Paris. 

But this is Nature's law, love, 
Though just it may not seem, 
That men should wake to sing, love; 
While maidens sleep and dream. 

Them care may not molest, love, 
Nor stir them from their slumbers, 
Though midnight find the swain, love. 
Still halting o'er his numbers. 

I watch the rosy dawn, love, 
Come stealing up the east, 
While all things round rejoice, love, 
That Night her reign has ceased. 

The lark will soon be heard, love, 
And on his way be winging; 
When Nature's poets, wake, love, 
Why should a man be singing?






The Miller's Daughter
 

It is the miller's daughter,
   And she is grown so dear, so dear,
That I would be the jewel
   That trembles at her ear:
For hid in ringlets day and night,
I'd touch her neck so warm and white.

And I would be the girdle 
   About her dainty, dainty waist,
And her heart would beat against me,
   In sorrow and in rest:
And I should know if it beat right,
I'd clasp it round so close and tight.

And I would be the necklace,
   And all day long to fall and rise
Upon her balmy bosom,
   With her laughter or her sighs:
And I would lie so light, so light,
I scarce should be unclasped at night.







Kisses Desired
 

Though I with strange desire
To kiss those rosy lips am set on fire,
Yet will I cease to crave
Sweet touches in such store,
As he who long before
From Lesbia them in thousands did receive.
Heart mine, but once me kiss,
And I by that sweet bliss
Even swear to cease you to importune more;
Poor one no number is;
Another word of me ye shall not hear
After one kiss, but still one kiss, my dear.







Stolen Pleasure
 

My sweet did sweetly sleep,
And on her rosy face
Stood tears of pearl, which beauty's self did weep;
I, wond'ring at her grace,
Did all amaz'd remain,
When Love said, Fool, can looks thy wishes crown?
Time past comes not again.
Then did I me bow down,
And kissing her fair breast, lips, cheeks, and eyes
Prov'd here on earth the joys of paradise.







To Lysander
 

(On some Verses he writ, and asking more for his Heart than twas worth.)
                                    I
 Take back that Heart, you with such Caution give, 
     Take the fond valu'd Trifle back;
 I hate Love-Merchants that a Trade wou'd drive 
     And meanly cunning Bargains make. 


                                     II
 I care not how the busy Market goes, 
    And scorn to Chaffer for a price: 
 Love does one Staple Rate on all impose, 
    Nor leaves it to the Trader's Choice. 


                                     III
 A Heart requires a Heart Unfeign'd and True, 
     Though Subt'ly you advance the Price,
 And ask a Rate that Simple Love ne'er knew:
     And the free Trade Monopolize. 

                                     IV
 An humble Slave the Buyer must become, 
     She must not bate a Look or Glance 
 You will have all or you'll have none; 
     See how Love's Market you inhance. 

                                     V
 Is't not enough, I gave you Heart for Heart, 
     But I must add my Lips and Eies; 
 I must no friendly Smile or Kiss impart; 
     But you must Dun me with Advice.
  
                                     VI
 And every Hour still more unjust you grow,
    Those Freedoms you my life deny,
 You to Adraste are oblig'd to show,
    And giver her all my Rifled Joy.
  
                                     VII
 Without Controul she gazes on that Face,
    And all the happy Envyed Night,
 In the pleas'd Circle of your fond imbrace:
    She takes away the Lovers Right.
  
                                     VIII
 From me she Ravishes those silent hours,
    That are by Sacred Love my due;
 Whilst I in vain accuse the angry Powers,
    That make me hopeless Love pursue.
  
                                     IX
 Adrastes Ears with that dear Voice are blest,
    That Charms my Soul at every Sound,
 And with those Love-Inchanting Touches prest:
    Which I ne'er felt without a Wound.
  
                                     X
 She has thee all: whilst I with silent Greif,
    The Fragments of they Softness feel,
 Yet dare not blame the happy licenc'd Thief:
    That does my Dear-bought Pleasures steal.
  
                                     XI
 Whilst like a Glimering Taper still I burn,
    And waste my self in my own flame,
 Adraste takes the welcome rich Return:
    And leaves me all the hopeless Pain. 

                                     XII
 Be just, my lovely Swain, and do not take
    Freedoms you'll not to me allow;
 Or give Amynta so much Freedom back:
    That she may Rove as well as you.
  
                                     XIII
 Let us then love upon the honest Square,
    Since Interest neither have design'd,
 For the sly Gamester, who ne'er plays me fair,
    Must Trick for Trick expect to find.                      
             








Amoretti XXX: My Love is like to ice, and I to fire
 

My Love is like to ice, and I to fire:
How comes it then that this her cold so great
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire,
But harder grows the more I her entreat?
Or how comes it that my exceeding heat
Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,
But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,
And feel my flames augmented manifold?
What more miraculous thing may be told,
That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,
And ice, which is congeal'd with senseless cold,
Should kindle fire by wonderful device?
   Such is the power of love in gentle mind,
   That it can alter all the course of kind.







Amoretti LV: So oft as I her beauty do behold
 

So oft as I her beauty do behold,
And therewith do her cruelty compare,
I marvel of what substance was the mould
The which her made at once so cruel-fair.
Not earth; for her high thoughts more heavenly are:
Not water; for her love doth burn like fire:
Not air; for she is not so light or rare:
Not fire; for she doth freeze with faint desire.

Then needs another element inquire
Whereof she might be made; that is, the sky.
For to the heaven her haughty looks aspire,
And eke her love is pure immortal high.
   Then since to heaven ye likened are the best,
   Be like in mercy as in all the rest. 







Barbara Allen
 

In Scarlet town, where I was born, 
   There was a fair maid dwellin', 
Made every youth cry Well-a-way! 
   Her name was Barbara Allen. 

All in the merry month of May, 
   When green buds they were swellin', 
Young Jemmy Grove on his death-bed lay, 
   For love of Barbara Allen. 

He sent his man in to her then, 
   To the town where she was dwellin'; 
"O haste and come to my master dear, 
   If your name be Barbara Allen. 

So slowly, slowly rase she up, 
   And slowly she came nigh him, 
And when she drew the curtain by-- 
   "Young man, I think you're dyin'. 

"O it's I am sick and very very sick, 
   And it's all for Barbara Allen.-- 
O the better for me ye'se never be, 
   Tho' your heart's blood were a-spillin'! 

"O dinna ye mind, young man, says she, 
   "When the red wine ye were fillin', 
That ye made the healths go round and round, 
   And slighted Barbara Allen? 

He turned his face unto the wall, 
   And death was with him dealin': 
"Adieu, adieu, my dear friends all, 
   And be kind to Barbara Allen! 

As she was walking o'er the fields, 
   She heard the dead-bell knellin'; 
And every jow the dead-bell gave 
   Cried "Woe to Barbara Allen. 

"O mother, mother, make my bed, 
   O make it saft and narrow: 
My love has died for me today, 
   I'll die for him tomorrow. 

"Farewell, she said, "ye virgins all, 
   And shun the fault I fell in: 
Henceforth take warning by the fall 
   Of cruel Barbara Allen. 







A Woman's Looks
 

    A woman's looks
    Are barbed hooks,
    That catch by art
    The strongest heart,
When yet they spend no breath.
    But let them speak,
    And sighing break
    Forth into tears,
    Their words are spears
That wound our souls to death.
    The rarest wit
    Is made forget,
    And like a child
    Is oft beguiled
With Love's sweet-seeming bait.
    Love with his rod
    So like a god
    Commands the mind
    We cannot find,
Fair shows hide foul deceit.
    Time, that all things
    In order brings,
    Hath taught me now
    To be more slow
In giving faith to speech:
    Since women's words
    No truth affords,
    And when they kiss
    They think by this
Us men to overreach.







Woman's Constancy
 

Now thou has loved me one whole day, 
Tomorrow when you leav'st, what wilt thou say? 
Wilt thou then antedate some new-made vow? 
            Or say that now 
We are not just those persons which we were? 
Or, that oaths made in reverential fear 
Of Love, and his wrath, any may forswear? 
Or, as true deaths true marriages untie, 
So lovers' contracts, images of those, 
Bind but till sleep, death's image, them unloose? 
            Or, your own end to justify, 
For having purposed change and falsehood, you 
Can have no way but falsehood to be true? 
Vain lunatic, against these scapes I could 
            Dispute and conquer, if I would, 
            Which I abstain to do, 
For by tomorrow, I may think so too.   







Sonnet 141: In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes
 

In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes, 
For they in thee a thousand errors note; 
But tis my heart that loves what they despise, 
Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote; 
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted, 
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone, 
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited 
To any sensual feast with thee alone: 
But my five wits nor my five senses can 
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, 
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man, 
Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be. 
   Only my plague thus far I count my gain, 
   That she that makes me sin awards me pain.





To Fanny
 

I cry your mercy--pity--love! Aye, love!

   Merciful love that tantalizes not,

One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,

   Unmasked, and being seen--without a blot!

O! let me have thee whole,--all--all--be mine!

   That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest

Of love, your kiss,--those hands, those eyes divine,

   That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast,--

Yourself--your soul--in pity give me all,

   Withhold no atom's atom or I die,

Or living on perhaps, your wretched thrall,

   Forget, in the mist of idle misery,

Life's purposes,--the palate of my mind

   Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!








Idea 43: "Why should your fair eyes with such sovereign grace
 

Why should your fair eyes with such sovereign grace 
Disperse their rays on every vulgar spirit, 
Whilst I in darkness in the self-same place 
Get not one glance to recompense my merit? 
So doth the ploughman gaze the wandering star, 
And only rest contented with the light, 
That never learned what constellations are, 
Beyond the bent of his unknowing sight, 
O! why should beauty, custom to obey, 
To their gross sense apply herself so ill? 
Would God I were as ignorant as they, 
When I am made unhappy by my skill; 
Only compelled on this poor good to boast, 
Heavens are not kind to them that know them most.





To a Lady that Desired I Would Love Her
 

Now you have freely given me leave to love,
      What will you do?
   Shall I your mirth, or passion move,
      When I begin to woo;
Will you torment, or scorn, or love me too?

Each petty beauty can disdain, and I
      Spite of your hate
   Without your leave can see, and die;
      Dispense a nobler fate!
'Tis easy to destroy, you may create.

Then give me leave to love, and love me too
      Not with design
   To raise, as Love's cursed rebels do,
      When puling poets whine,
Fame to their beauty, from their blubbered eyne.

Grief is a puddle, and reflects not clear
      Your beauty's rays;
   Joys are pure streams, your eyes appear
      Sullen in sadder lays;
In cheerful numbers they shine bright with praise,

Which shall not mention to express you fair,
      Wounds, flames, and darts,
   Storms in your brow, nets in your hair,
      Suborning all your parts,
Or to betray, or torture captive hearts.

I'll make your eyes like morning suns appear,
      As mild, and fair;
   Your brow as crystal smooth, and clear,
      And your disheveled hair
Shall flow like a calm region of the air. 







Friendship After Love
 

After the fierce midsummer all ablaze 
    Has burned itself to ashes, and expires 
    In the intensity of its own fires, 
There come the mellow, mild, St. Martin days 
Crowned with the calm of peace, but sad with haze. 
    So after Love has led us, till he tires 
    Of his own throes, and torments, and desires, 
Comes large-eyed friendship: with a restful gaze, 
He beckons us to follow, and across 
    Cool verdant vales we wander free from care. 
    Is it a touch of frost lies in the air? 
Why are we haunted with a sense of loss? 
We do not wish the pain back, or the heat; 
And yet, and yet, these days are incomplete.





The House of Life 53: Without Her
 

What of her glass without her? The blank gray 
   There where the pool is blind of the moon's face. 
   Her dress without her? The tossed empty space 
Of cloud-rack whence the moon has passed away. 
Her paths without her? Day's appointed sway 
   Usurped by desolate night. Her pillowed place 
   Without her? Tears, ah me! for love's good grace, 
And cold forgetfulness of night or day. 

What of the heart without her? Nay, poor heart, 
   Of thee what word remains ere speech be still? 
   A wayfarer by barren ways and chill, 
Steep ways and weary, without her thou art, 
Where the long cloud, the long wood's counterpart, 
   Sheds doubled darkness up the labouring hill.





Surprised by Joy
 

Surprised by joy--impatient as the Wind 
I turned to share the transport--Oh! with whom 
But Thee, long buried in the silent Tomb, 
That spot which no vicissitude can find? 
Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind-- 
But how could I forget thee?--Through what power, 
Even for the least division of an hour, 
Have I been so beguiled as to be blind 
To my most grievous loss!--That thought's return 
Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore, 
Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn, 
Knowing my heart's best treasure was no more; 
That neither present time, nor years unborn 
Could to my sight that heavenly face restore. 






from Maud(Part XVIII): I have led her Home, my love, my only friend
 

I have led her home, my love, my only friend, 
There is none like her, none. 
And never yet so warmly ran my blood 
And sweetly, on and on 
Calming itself to the long-wished-for end, 
Full to the banks, close on the promised good. 

None like her, none. 
Just now the dry-tongued laurels' pattering talk 
Seem'd her light foot along the garden walk, 
And shook my heart to think she comes once more; 
But even then I heard her close the door, 
The gates of Heaven are closed, and she is gone. 

There is none like her, none. 
Nor will be when our summers have deceased. 
O, art thou sighing for Lebanon 
In the long breeze that streams to thy delicious East, 
Sighing for Lebanon, 
Dark cedar, tho' thy limbs have here increased, 
Upon a pastoral slope as fair, 

And looking to the South, and fed 
With honeyed rain and delicate air, 
And haunted by the starry head 
Of her whose gentle will has changed my fate, 
And made my life a perfumed altar-frame; 
And over whom thy darkness must have spread 
With such delight as theirs of old, thy great 
Forefathers of the thornless garden, there 
Shadowing the snow-limbed Eve from whom she came. 

Here will I lie, while these long branches sway, 
And you fair stars that crown a happy day 
Go in and out as if at merry play, 
Who am no more so all forlorn, 
As when it seemed far better to be born 
To labour and the mattock-hardened hand 
Than nursed at ease and brought to understand 
A sad astrology, the boundless plan 
That makes you tyrants in your iron skies, 
Innumerable, pitiless, passionless eyes, 
Cold fires, yet with power to burn and brand 
His nothingness into man. 

But now shine on, and what care I, 
Who in this stormy gulf have found a pearl 
The countercharm of space and hollow sky, 
And do accept my madness, and would die 
To save from some slight shame one simple girl. 

Would die; for sullen-seeming Death may give 
More life to Love than is or ever was 
In our low world, where yet 'tis sweet to live. 
Let no one ask me how it came to pass; 
It seems that I am happy, that to me 
A livelier emerald twinkles in the grass, 
A purer sapphire melts into the sea. 

Not die; but live a life of truest breath, 
And teach true life to fight with mortal wrongs. 
Oh, why should Love, like men in drinking-songs, 
Spice his fair banquet with the dust of death? 

Make answer, Maud my bliss, 
Maud made my Maud by that long loving kiss, 
Life of my life, wilt thou not answer this? 
"The dusky strand of Death inwoven here 
With dear Love's tie, makes love himself more dear. 
Is that enchanted moan only the swell 
Of the long waves that roll in yonder bay? 
And hark the clock within, the silver knell 
Of twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white, 
And die to live, long as my pulses play; 
But now by this my love has closed her sight 
And given false death her hand, and stol'n away 
To dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell 

Among the fragments of the golden day. 
May nothing there her maiden grace affright! 
Dear heart, I feel with thee the drowsy spell. 
My bride to be, my evermore delight, 
My own heart's heart, my ownest own, farewell; 
It is but for a little space I go: 
And ye meanwhile far over moor and fell 
Beat to the noiseless music of the night! 
Has our whole earth gone nearer to the glow 
Of your soft splendour that you look so bright? 
I have climbed nearer out of lonely Hell. 
Beat, happy stars, timing with things below, 
Beat with my heart more blest than heart can tell. 
Blest, but for some dark undercurrent woe 
That seems to draw--but it shall not be so: 
Let all be well, be well.





An Afternoon at the Beach
 

I'll go among the dead to see my friend. 
The place I leave is beautiful: the sea 
Repeats the winds' far swell in its long sound, 
And, there beside it, houses solemnly 
Shine with the modest courage of the land, 
While swimmers try the verge of what they see. 

I cannot go, although I should pretend 
Some final self whose phantom eye could see 
Him who because he is not cannot change. 
And yet the thought of going makes the sea, 
The land, the swimmers, and myself seem strange, 
Almost as strange as they will someday be.





Complaint of the Absence of Her Love Being Upon the Sea
 

O happy dames, that may embrace
   The fruit of your delight,
Help to bewail the woeful case
   And eke the heavy plight
Of me, that wonted to rejoice
The fortune of my pleasant choice;
Good ladies, help to fill my mourning voice.

In ship, freight with remembrance
   Of thoughts and pleasures past,
He sails that hath in governance
   My life while it will last;
With scalding sighs, for lack of gale,
Furthering his hope, that is his sail,
Toward me, the sweet port of his avail.

Alas! how oft in dreams I see
   Those eyes that were my food;
Which sometime so delighted me,
   That yet they do me good;
Wherewith I wake with his return,
Whose absent flame did make me burn:
But when I find the lack, Lord, how I mourn!

When other lovers in arms across
   Rejoice their chief delight.
Drowned in tears, to mourn my loss
   I stand the bitter night
In my window, where I may see
Before the winds how the clouds flee.
Lo! what a mariner love hath made of me!

And in green waves when the salt flood
   Doth rise by rage of wind,
A thousand fancies in that mood
   Assail my restless mind.
Alas! now drencheth my sweet foe,
That with the spoil of my heart did go,
And left me; but, alas! why did he so?

And when the seas wax calm again
   To chase fro me annoy,
My doubtful hope doth cause me pain;
   So dread cuts off my joy.
Thus is my wealth mingled with woe,
And of each thought a doubt doth grow;
Now he comes! Will he come? Alas, no, no!







A Letter to her Husband, absent upon Publick employment
 

My head, my heart, mine Eyes, my life, nay more, 
My joy, my Magazine of earthly store, 
If two be one, as surely thou and I, 
How stayest thou there, whilst I at Ipswich lye? 
So many steps, head from the heart to sever 
If but a neck, soon should we be together: 
I like the earth this season, mourn in black, 
My Sun is gone so far in's Zodiack, 
Whom whilst I 'joy'd, nor storms, nor frosts I felt, 
His warmth such frigid colds did cause to melt. 
My chilled limbs now nummed lye forlorn; 
Return, return sweet  Sol from Capricorn; 
In this dead time, alas, what can I more 
Then view those fruits which through thy heat I bore? 
Which sweet contentment yield me for a space, 
True living Pictures of their Fathers face. 
O strange effect! now thou art Southward gone, 
I weary grow, the tedious day so long; 
But when thou Northward to me shalt return, 
I wish my Sun may never set, but burn 
Within the Cancer of my glowing breast, 
The welcome house of him my dearest guest. 
Where ever, ever stay, and go not thence, 
Till natures sad decree shall call thee hence; 
Flesh of thy flesh, bone of thy bone, 
I here, thou there, yet both but one. 






Echo
 

Come to me in the silence of the night; 
   Come in the speaking silence of a dream; 
Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright 
   As sunlight on a stream; 
      Come back in tears, 
O memory, hope, love of finished years. 

Oh dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet, 
   Whose wakening should have been in Paradise, 
Where souls brimfull of love abide and meet; 
   Where thirsting longing eyes 
      Watch the slow door 
That opening, letting in, lets out no more. 

Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live 
   My very life again tho' cold in death: 
Come back to me in dreams, that I may give 
   Pulse for pulse, breath for breath: 
      Speak low, lean low, 
As long ago, my love, how long ago. 







A Dirge
 

Why were you born when the snow was falling?

You should have come to the cuckoo's calling,

Or when grapes are green in the cluster,

Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster

   For their far off flying

   From summer dying.


Why did you die when the lambs were cropping?

You should have died at the apples' dropping,

When the grasshopper comes to trouble,

And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,

   And all winds go sighing

   For sweet things dying.








from Maud: O that 'twere possible
 

O that 'twere possible
After long grief and pain
To find the arms of my true love
Round me once again!...

A shadow flits before me,
Not thou, but like to thee:
Ah, Christ! that it were possible
For one short hour to see
The souls we loved, that they might tell us
What and where they be!







A Description of Such a One As He Would Love
 

A face that should content me wondrous well
Should not be fair but lovely to behold,
With gladsome cheer all grief for to expel;
With sober looks so would I that it should
Speak without words such words as none can tell;
Her tress also should be of crisped gold;
With wit; and thus might chance I might be tied,
And knit again the knot that should not slide.







To Asra
 

Are there two things, of all which men possess,
That are so like each other and so near,
As mutual Love seems like to Happiness?
Dear Asra, woman beyond utterance dear!
This love which ever welling at my heart,
Now in its living fount doth heave and fall,
Now overflowing pours thro' every part
Of all my frame, and fills and changes all,
Like vernal waters springing up through snow,
This Love that seeming great beyond the power
Of growth, yet seemeth ever more to grow,
Could I transmute the whole to one rich Dower
Of Happy Life, and give it all to Thee,
Thy lot, methinks, were Heaven, thy age, Eternity!







Love's Growth
 

I scarce believe my love to be so pure 
   As I had thought it was, 
   Because it doth endure 
Vicissitude, and season, as the grass; 
Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore 
My love was infinite, if spring make' it more. 

But if medicine, love, which cures all sorrow 
With more, not only be no quintessence, 
But mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense, 
And of the sun his working vigor borrow, 
Love's not so pure, and abstract, as they use 
To say, which have no mistress but their muse, 
But as all else, being elemented too, 
Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do. 

And yet no greater, but more eminent, 
   Love by the spring is grown; 
   As, in the firmament, 
Stars by the sun are not enlarged, but shown, 
Gentle love deeds, as blossoms on a bough, 
From love's awakened root do bud out now. 

If, as water stirred more circles be 
Produced by one, love such additions take, 
Those, like so many spheres, but one heaven make, 
For they are all concentric unto thee; 
And though each spring do add to love new heat, 
As princes do in time of action get 
New taxes, and remit them not in peace, 
No winter shall abate the spring's increase. 







Wedding Hymn
 

Thou God, whose high, eternal Love 
Is the only blue sky of our life, 
Clear all the Heaven that bends above 
The life-road of this man and wife. 
May these two lives be but one note 
In the world's strange-sounding harmony, 
Whose sacred music e'er shall float 
Through every discord up to Thee. 
As when from separate stars two beams 
Unite to form one tender ray: 
As when two sweet but shadowy dreams 
Explain each other in the day: 
So may these two dear hearts one light 
Emit, and each interpret each. 
Let an angel come and dwell tonight 
In this dear double-heart, and teach. 






Bridal Song
 

O come, soft rest of cares! come, Night! 
       Come, naked Virtue's only tire, 
The reapd harvest of the light 
    Bound up in sheaves of sacred fire, 
       Love calls to war: 
             Sighs his alarms, 
       Lips his swords are, 
             The fields his arms. 

Come, Night, and lay thy velvet hand 
    On glorious Day's outfacing face; 
And all thy crownd flames command 
    For torches to our nuptial grace. 
       Love calls to war: 
             Sighs his alarms, 
       Lips his swords are, 
             The field his arms. 






Marriage Morning
 

Light, so low upon earth, 
   You send a flash to the sun. 
Here is the golden close of love, 
   All my wooing is done. 
Oh, all the woods and the meadows, 
   Woods, where we hid from the wet, 
Stiles where we stayed to be kind, 
   Meadows in which we met! 
Light, so low in the vale 
   You flash and lighten afar, 
For this is the golden morning of love, 
   And you are his morning star. 
Flash, I am coming, I come, 
   By meadow and stile and wood, 
Oh, lighten into my eyes and my heart, 
   Into my heart and my blood! 
Heart, are you great enough 
   For a love that never tires? 
O heart, are you great enough for love? 
   I have heard of thorns and briers. 
Over the thorns and briers, 
   Over the meadows and stiles, 
Over the world to the end of it 
   Flash of a million miles. 







The Real and True and Sure
 

Marriage on earth seems such a counterfeit,

Mere imitation of the inimitable:

In heaven we have the real and true and sure.

'Tis there they neither marry nor are given

In marriage but are as the angels: right,

Oh how right that is, how like Jesus Christ

To say that! Marriage-making for the earth,

With gold so much,-- birth, power, repute so much,

Or beauty, youth so much, in lack of these!

Be as the angels rather, who, apart,

Know themselves into one, are found at length

Married, but marry never, no, nor give

In marriage; they are man and wife at once

When the true time is: here we have to wait

Not so long neither! Could we by a wish

Have what we will and get the future now,

Would we wish aught done undone in the past?

So, let him wait God's instant men call years;

Meantime hold hard by truth and his great soul,

Do out the duty! Through such souls alone

God stooping shows sufficient of His light

For us i' the dark to rise by. And I rise.








Sonnet 109: O! never say that I was false of heart
 

O! never say that I was false of heart, 
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify. 
As easy might I from myself depart 
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie: 
That is my home of love; if I have ranged, 
Like him that travels, I return again, 
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged, 
So that myself bring water for my stain. 
Never believe, though in my nature reigned 
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, 
That it could so preposterously be stained, 
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good; 
   For nothing this wide universe I call, 
   Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.





A Modest Love
 

The lowest trees have tops, the ant her gall,
   The fly her spleen, the little sparks their heat;
The slender hairs cast shadows, though but small,
   And bees have stings, although they be not great;
Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs;
And love is love, in beggars as in kings.

Where rivers smoothest run, deep are the fords;
   The dial stirs, yet none perceives it move;
The firmest faith is in the fewest words;
   The turtles cannot sing, and yet they love:
True hearts have eyes and ears, no tongues to speak;
They hear and see, and sigh, and then they break.







from Merlin and Vivien
 

In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,
Faith and unfaith can ne'er be equal powers:
Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.

It is the little rift within the lute,
That by and by will make the music mute,
And ever widening slowly silence all.

The little rift within the lover's lute,
Or little pitted speck in garner'd fruit,
That rotting inward slowly moulders all.

It is not worth the keeping: let it go:
But shall it? answer, darling, answer, no.
And trust me not at all or all in all.







Love Is A Sickness Full of Woes
 

Love is a sickness full of woes,
   All remedies refusing;
A plant that with most cutting grows,
   Most barren with best using.
      Why so?
More we enjoy it, more it dies;
If not enjoyed, it sighting cries,
      Heigh ho!

Love is a torment of the mind,
   A tempest everlasting;
And Jove hath made it of a kind
   Not well, not full, nor fasting.
      Why so?
More we enjoy it, more it dies;
If not enjoyed, it sighing cries,
      Heigh ho!







Never Love Unless
 

Never love unless you can
Bear with all the faults of man:
Men sometimes will jealous be
Though but little cause they see;
And hang the head, as discontent,
And speak what straight they will repent.

Men that but one saint adore
Make a show of love to more.
Beauty must be scorned in none,
Though but truly served in one:
For what is courtship but disguise?
True hearts may have dissembling eyes.

Men, when their affairs require,
Must awhile themselves retire;
Sometimes hunt, and sometimes hawk,
And not ever sit and talk.
If these and such-like you can bear, 
Then like, and love, and never fear!







Love
 

We cannot live, except thus mutually

We alternate, aware or unaware,

The reflex act of life: and when we bear

Our virtue onward most impulsively,

Most full of invocation, and to be

Most instantly compellant, certes, there

We live most life, whoever breathes most air

And counts his dying years by sun and sea.

But when a soul, by choice and conscience, doth

Throw out her full force on another soul,

The conscience and the concentration both

Make mere life, Love. For Life in perfect whole

And aim consummated, is Love in sooth,

As nature's magnet-heat rounds pole with pole.








Of Love
 

How Love came in, I do not know,
Whether by th' eye, or eare, or no:
Or whether with the soule it came
(At first) infused with the same:
Whether in part tis here or there,
Or, like the soule, whole every where:
This troubles me: but as I well
As any other, this can tell;
That when from hence she does depart,
The out-let then is from the heart.







I Shall Be Married on Monday Morning
 

As I was walking one morning in spring,
I heard a fair maiden most charmingly sing,
All under her cow, as she sat a-milking,
Saying, I shall be married, next Monday morning.

You fairest of all creatures, my eyes e'er beheld,
Oh! Where do you live love, or where do you dwell,
I dwell at the top of yon bonny brown hill,
I shall be fifteen years old next Monday morning.

Fifteen years old love, is too young to marry,
The other five years love, I'd have you to tarry,
And perhaps in the meantime love you might be sorry,
So put back your wedding, next Monday morning.

You talk like a man without reason or skill,
Five years I've been waiting against my will,
Now, I am resolved my mind to fulfil,
I wish that tomorrow was Monday morning.

On Saturday night it is all my care,
To powder my locks and curl my hair,
And my two pretty maidens to wait on me there,
To dance at my wedding next Monday morning.

My husband will buy me a guinea gold ring,
And at night he'll give me a far better thing,
With two precious jewels he'll be me adorning,
When I am his bride, on Monday morning. 







Love Me Little, Love Me Long
 

Love me little, love me long, 
Is the burden of my song. 
Love that is too hot and strong 
    Burneth soon to waste: 
Still, I would not have thee cold, 
Not too backward, nor too bold; 
Love that lasteth till 'tis old 
    Fadeth not in haste. 
         Love me little, love me long, 
         Is the burden of my song. 

If thou lovest me too much 
It will not prove as true as touch; 
Love me little, more than such, 
    For I fear the end: 
I am with little well content, 
And a little from thee sent 
Is enough, with true intent 
    To be steadfast friend. 
       Love me little, love me long, 
       Is the burden of my song. 

Say thou lov'st me while thou live; 
I to thee my love will give, 
never dreaming to deceive 
    Whiles that life endures: 
Nay, and after death, in sooth, 
I too thee will keep my truth, 
As now, when in my May of youth: 
    This my love assures. 
       Love me little, love me long, 
       Is the burden on my song. 

Constant love is moderate ever, 
And it will through life persver: 
Give me that, with true endeavour 
    I will it restore. 
A suit of durance let it be 
For all weathers that for me, 
For the land or for the sea, 
    Lasting evermore. 
       Love me little, love me long, 
       Is the burden of my song. 

Winter's cold, or summer's heat, 
Autumn's tempests, on it beat, 
It can never know defeat, 
    Never can rebel: 
Such the love that I would gain, 
Such the love, I tell thee plain, 
Thou must give, or woo in vain: 
    So to thee, farewell 
       Love me little, love me long, 
       Is the burden of my song. 







Down By the Salley Gardens
 

Down by the salley gardens 
   my love and I did meet; 
She passed the salley gardens 
   with little snow-white feet. 
She bid me take love easy, 
   as the leaves grow on the tree; 
But I, being young and foolish, 
   with her would not agree. 

In a field by the river 
   my love and I did stand, 
And on my leaning shoulder 
   she laid her snow-white hand. 
She bid me take life easy, 
   as the grass grows on the weirs; 
But I was young and foolish, 
   and now am full of tears.   







Invitation to Love
 

Come when the nights are bright with stars 
Or come when the moon is mellow; 
Come when the sun his golden bars 
Drops on the hay-field yellow. 
Come in the twilight soft and gray, 
Come in the night or come in the day, 
Come, O love, whene'er you may, 
And you are welcome, welcome. 

You are sweet, O Love, dear Love, 
You are soft as the nesting dove. 
Come to my heart and bring it to rest 
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest. 

Come when my heart is full of grief 
Or when my heart is merry; 
Come with the falling of the leaf 
Or with the redd'ning cherry. 
Come when the year's first blossom blows, 
Come when the summer gleams and glows, 
Come with the winter's drifting snows, 
And you are welcome, welcome. 






Out of Catullus
 

Come and let us live my Deare,
Let us love and never feare,
What the sowrest Fathers say:
Brightest Sol that dies to day
Lives againe as blithe to morrow,
But if we darke sons of sorrow
Set; o then, how long a Night 
Shuts the Eyes of our short light!
Then let amorous kisses dwell
On our lips, begin and tell
A Thousand, and a Hundred, score
An Hundred, and a Thousand more,
Till another Thousand smother
That, and that wipe of another.
Thus at last when we have numbred
Many a Thousand, many a Hundred;
Wee'l confound the reckoning quite,
And lose our selves in wild delight:
While our joyes so multiply,
As shall mocke the envious eye.






Love Lives Beyond the Tomb
 

Love lives beyond 
The tomb, the earth, which fades like dew-- 
               I love the fond, 
The faithful, and the true 

               Love lives in sleep, 
'Tis happiness of healthy dreams 
               Eve's dews may weep, 
But love delightful seems. 

               'Tis seen in flowers, 
And in the even's pearly dew 
               On earth's green hours, 
And in the heaven's eternal blue. 

               Tis heard in spring 
When light and sunbeams, warm and kind, 
               On angels' wing 
Bring love and music to the wind. 

               And where is voice, 
So young, so beautiful and sweet 
               As nature's choice, 
Where Spring and lovers meet? 

               Love lives beyond 
The tomb, the earth, the flowers, and dew. 
               I love the fond, 
The faithful, young and true. 






The Wine of Love
 

The wine of Love is music, 
   And the feast of Love is song: 
And when Love sits down to the banquet, 
   Love sits long: 

Sits long and ariseth drunken, 
   But not with the feast and the wine; 
He reeleth with his own heart, 
   That great rich Vine.





from Hero and Leander: "It lies not in our power to love or hate"
 

It lies not in our power to love or hate, 
For will in us is overruled by fate. 
When two are stripped, long ere the course begin, 
We wish that one should lose, the other win; 
And one especially do we affect 
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect: 
The reason no man knows; let it suffice 
What we behold is censured by our eyes. 
Where both deliberate, the love is slight: 
Who ever loved, that loved not at first sight?





Sometimes with One I Love
 

Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuse unreturn'd love,

But now I think there is no unreturn'd love, the pay is certain one way or another

(I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return'd,

Yet out of that I have written these songs).







The Dream
 

All trembling in my arms Aminta lay, 
Defending of the bliss I strove to take; 
Raising my rapture by her kind delay, 
Her force so charming was and weak. 
The soft resistance did betray the grant, 
While I pressed on the heaven of my desires; 
Her rising breasts with nimbler motions pant; 
Her dying eyes assume new fires. 
Now to the height of languishment she grows, 
And still her looks new charms put on; 
Now the last mystery of Love she knows, 
We sigh, and kiss: I waked, and all was done. 

Twas but a dream, yet by my heart I knew, 
Which still was panting, part of it was true: 
Oh how I strove the rest to have believed; 
Ashamed and angry to be undeceived! 






Cherry-Ripe
 

There is a garden in her face 
   Where roses and white lilies blow; 
A heavenly paradise is that place, 
   Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow: 
      There cherries grow which none may buy 
      Till "Cherry-ripe themselves do cry. 

Those cherries fairly do enclose 
   Of orient pearl a double row, 
Which when her lovely laughter shows, 
   They look like rose-buds filled with snow; 
      Yet them no peer nor prince can buy 
      Till "Cherry-ripe themselves do cry. 

Her eyes like angels watch them still; 
   Her brows like bended bows do stand, 
Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill 
   All that attempt with eye or hand 
      Those sacred cherries to come nigh, 
      Till "Cherry-ripe themselves do cry.





"I cry your mercy-pity-love! -aye, love!"
 

I cry your mercy--pity--love!--aye, love!

   Merciful love that tantalizes not,

One-thoughted, never-wandering, guileless love,

   Unmasked, and being seen--without a blot!

O! let me have thee whole,--all--all--be mine!

   That shape, that fairness, that sweet minor zest

Of love, your kiss,--those hands, those eyes divine,

   That warm, white, lucent, million-pleasured breast,

Yourself--your soul--in pity give me all,

   Withhold no atom's atom or I die

Or living on perhaps, your wretched thrall,

   Forget, in the mist of idle misery,

Life's purposes,--the palate of my mind

   Losing its gust, and my ambition blind!







Desire
 

Where true Love burns Desire is Love's pure flame;
It is the reflex of our earthly frame,
That takes its meaning from the nobler part,
And but translates the language of the heart.






A Ring Presented to Julia
 

   Julia, I bring
   To thee this ring,
Made for thy finger fit;
   To show by this
   That our love is
(Or should be) like to it.

   Close though it be,
   The joint is free;
So when Love's yoke is on,
   It must not gall,
   Or fret at all
With hard oppression.

   But it must play
   Still either way,
And be, too, such a yoke
   As not too wide
   To overslide,
Or be so strait to choke.

   So we who bear
   This beam must rear
Ourselves to such a height
   As that the stay
   Of either may
Create the burden light.

   And as this round
   Is nowhere found
To flaw, or else to sever;
   So let our love
   As endless prove,
And pure as gold for ever.






Romance
 

I will make you brooches and toys for your delight
Of bird-song at morning and star-shine at night.
I will make a palace fit for you and me
Of green days in forests and blue days at sea.

I will make my kitchen, and you shall keep your room,
Where white flows the river and bright blows the broom,
And you shall wash your linen and keep your body white
In rainfall at morning and dewfall at night.

And this shall be for music when no one else is near,
The fine song for singing, the rare song to hear!
That only I remember, that only you admire,
Of the broad road that stretches and the roadside fire.






The Oblation
 

Ask nothing more of me, sweet; 
   All I can give you I give. 
      Heart of my heart, were it more, 
More would be laid at your feet-- 
   Love that should help you to live, 
      Song that should spur you to soar. 

All things were nothing to give, 
   Once to have sense of you more, 
      Touch you and taste of you, sweet, 
Think you and breathe you and live, 
   Swept of your wings as they soar, 
      Trodden by chance of your feet. 

I that have love and no more 
   Give you but love of you, sweet. 
      He that hath more, let him give; 
He that hath wings, let him soar; 
   Mine is the heart at your feet 
      Here, that must love you to live. 






Meet Me in the Green Glen
 

Love, meet me in the green glen,
   Beside the tall elm-tree,
Where the sweetbriar smells so sweet agen;
   There come with me.
    Meet me in the green glen.

Meet me at the sunset
   Down in the green glen,
Where we've often met
   By hawthorn-tree and foxes' den,
    Meet me in the green glen.

Meet me in the green glen,
   By sweetbriar bushes there;
Meet me by your own sen,
   Where the wild thyme blossoms fair.
    Meet me in the green glen.

Meet me by the sweetbriar,
   By the mole-hill swelling there;
When the west glows like a fire
   God's crimson bed is there.
    Meet me in the green glen.






An Answer to Another Persuading a Lady to Marriage
 

Forbear, bold youth, all's Heaven here,
   And what you do aver,
To others, courtship may appear,
   'Tis sacriledge to her.

She is a publick deity,
   And were't not very odd
She should depose her self to be
   A pretty household god?

First make the sun in private shine,
   And bid the world adieu,
That so he may his beams confine
   In complement to you.

But if of that you do despair,
   Think how you did amiss,
To strive to fix her beams which are
   More bright and large than this.






I Love You
 

I love your lips when they're wet with wine
    And red with a wild desire;
I love your eyes when the lovelight lies
    Lit with a passionate fire.
I love your arms when the warm white flesh
    Touches mine in a fond embrace;
I love your hair when the strands enmesh
    Your kisses against my face.

Not for me the cold, calm kiss
    Of a virgin's bloodless love;
Not for me the saint's white bliss,
    Nor the heart of a spotless dove.
But give me the love that so freely gives
    And laughs at the whole world's blame,
With your body so young and warm in my arms,
    It sets my poor heart aflame.

So kiss me sweet with your warm wet mouth,
    Still fragrant with ruby wine,
And say with a fervor born of the South
    That your body and soul are mine.
Clasp me close in your warm young arms,
    While the pale stars shine above,
And we'll live our whole young lives away
    In the joys of a living love.






A Man's Requirements
 

I 
Love me Sweet, with all thou art, 
   Feeling, thinking, seeing; 
Love me in the lightest part, 
   Love me in full being. 

II 
Love me with thine open youth 
   In its frank surrender; 
With the vowing of thy mouth, 
   With its silence tender. 

III 
Love me with thine azure eyes, 
   Made for earnest granting; 
Taking colour from the skies, 
   Can Heaven's truth be wanting? 

IV 
Love me with their lids, that fall 
   Snow-like at first meeting; 
Love me with thine heart, that all 
   Neighbours then see beating. 

V 
Love me with thine hand stretched out 
   Freely--open-minded: 
Love me with thy loitering foot,-- 
   Hearing one behind it. 

VI 
Love me with thy voice, that turns 
   Sudden faint above me; 
Love me with thy blush that burns 
   When I murmur Love me! 

VII 
Love me with thy thinking soul, 
   Break it to love-sighing; 
Love me with thy thoughts that roll 
   On through living--dying. 

VIII 
Love me when in thy gorgeous airs, 
   When the world has crowned thee; 
Love me, kneeling at thy prayers, 
   With the angels round thee. 

IX 
Love me pure, as musers do, 
   Up the woodlands shady: 
Love me gaily, fast and true 
   As a winsome lady. 

X 
Through all hopes that keep us brave, 
   Farther off or nigher, 
Love me for the house and grave, 
   And for something higher. 

XI 
Thus, if thou wilt prove me, Dear, 
   Woman's love no fable. 
I will love thee--half a year-- 
   As a man is able. 







The Anniversary
 

All Kings, and all their favourites, 
         All glory of honours, beauties, wits, 
    The sun itself, which makes times, as they pass, 
    Is elder by a year now than it was 
    When thou and I first one another saw: 
    All other things to their destruction draw, 
         Only our love hath no decay; 
    This no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday, 
    Running it never runs from us away, 
But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day. 

         Two graves must hide thine and my corse; 
         If one might, death were no divorce. 
    Alas, as well as other Princes, we 
    (Who Prince enough in one another be) 
    Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears, 
    Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears; 
         But souls where nothing dwells but love 
    (All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove 
    This, or a love increasd there above, 
When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove. 

         And then we shall be throughly blessed; 
         But we no more than all the rest. 
    Here upon earth we're Kings, and none but we 
    Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects be; 
    Who is so safe as we? where none can do 
    Treason to us, except one of us two. 
         True and false fears let us refrain, 
    Let us love nobly, and live, and add again 
    Years and years unto years, till we attain 
To write threescore: this is the second of our reign. 






A Drinking Song
 

Wine comes in at the mouth 
And love comes in at the eye; 
That's all we shall know for truth 
Before we grow old and die. 
I lift the glass to my mouth, 
I look at you, and I sigh.





Walsinghame
 

As you came from the holy land

    of Walsinghame

Met you not with my true love

    By the way as you came?


How shall I know your true love

    That have met many one

As I went to the holy land

    That have come, that have gone?


She is neither white nor brown

    But as the heavens fair

There is none hath a form so divine

    In the earth or the air.


Such an one did I meet, good Sir,

    Such an Angelic face,

Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear

    By her gait, by her grace.


She hath left me here all alone,

    All alone as unknown,

Who sometimes did me lead with her self,

    And me loved as her own.


What's the cause that she leaves you alone

    And a new way doth take;

Who loved you once as her own

    And her joy did you make?


I have loved her all my youth,

    But now old, as you see,

Love likes not the falling fruit

    From the withered tree.


Know that love is a careless child

    And forgets promise past,

He is blind, he is deaf when he list

    And in faith never fast.


His desire is a dureless content

    And a trustless joy

He is won with a world of despair

    And is lost with a toy.


Of womenkind such indeed is the love

    Or the word Love abused

Under which many childish desires

    And conceits are excused.


But true Love is a durable fire

    In the mind ever burning;

Never sick, never old, never dead,

    From itself never turning.







The Wounded Cupid. Song
 

Cupid as he lay among 
Roses, by a Bee was stung. 
Whereupon in anger flying 
To his Mother, said thus crying; 
Help! O help! your Boy's a dying. 
And why, my pretty Lad, said she? 
Then blubbering, replied he, 
A winged Snake has bitten me, 
Which Country people call a Bee. 
At which she smil'd; then with her hairs 
And kisses drying up his tears: 
Alas! said she, my Wag! if this 
Such a pernicious torment is: 
Come tell me then, how great's the smart 
Of those, thou woundest with thy Dart!





To His Mistress Going to Bed
 

Come, Madam, come, all rest my powers defy, 
Until I labour, I in labour lie. 
The foe oft-times having the foe in sight, 
Is tir'd with standing though he never fight. 
Off with that girdle, like heaven's Zone glistering, 
But a far fairer world encompassing. 
Unpin that spangled breastplate which you wear, 
That th'eyes of busy fools may be stopped there. 
Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime, 
Tells me from you, that now it is bed time. 
Off with that happy busk, which I envy, 
That still can be, and still can stand so nigh. 
Your gown going off, such beauteous state reveals, 
As when from flowery meads th'hill's shadow steals. 
Off with that wiry Coronet and shew   
The hairy Diadem which on you doth grow: 
Now off with those shoes, and then safely tread 
In this love's hallow'd temple, this soft bed. 
In such white robes, heaven's Angels used to be 
Received by men; Thou Angel bringst with thee 
A heaven like Mahomet's Paradise; and though 
Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know, 
By this these Angels from an evil sprite, 
Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright. 
    Licence my roving hands, and let them go,   
Before, behind, between, above, below. 
O my America! my new-found-land, 
My kingdom, safeliest when with one man mann'd, 
My Mine of precious stones, My Empirie, 
How blest am I in this discovering thee! 
To enter in these bonds, is to be free; 
Then where my hand is set, my seal shall be. 
    Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee, 
As souls unbodied, bodies uncloth'd must be, 
To taste whole joys. Gems which you women use 
Are like Atlanta's balls, cast in men's views, 
That when a fool's eye lighteth on a Gem, 
His earthly soul may covet theirs, not them. 
Like pictures, or like books' gay coverings made 
For lay-men, are all women thus array'd; 
Themselves are mystic books, which only we   
(Whom their imputed grace will dignify) 
Must see reveal'd. Then since that I may know; 
As liberally, as to a Midwife, shew 
Thy self: cast all, yea, this white linen hence, 
There is no penance due to innocence. 
    To teach thee, I am naked first; why then 
What needst thou have more covering than a man. 






"Go, lovely Rose"
 

Go, lovely Rose--
      Tell her that wastes her time and me,
      That now she knows,
When I resemble her to thee,
How sweet and fair she seems to be.

      Tell her that's young,
And shuns to have her graces spied,
      That hadst thou sprung
In deserts where no men abide,
Thou must have uncommended died.

      Small is the worth
Of beauty from the light retired:
      Bid her come forth,
Suffer herself to be desired,
And not blush so to be admired.

      Then die--that she
The common fate of all things rare
      May read in thee;
How small a part of time they share
That are so wondrous sweet and fair!






"I know that all beneath the moon decays"
 

I know that all beneath the moon decays,
And what by mortals in this world is brought,
In Time's great periods shall return to nought;
That fairest states have fatal nights and days;
I know how all the Muse's heavenly lays,
With toil of spright which are so dearly bought,
As idle sounds of few or none are sought,
And that nought lighter is than airy praise.
I know frail beauty like the purple flower,
To which one morn oft birth and death affords;
That love a jarring is of minds' accords,
Where sense and will invassal reason's power:
Know what I list, this all can not me move,
But that, O me! I both must write and love.






One Girl
 

                               I
Like the sweet apple which reddens upon the topmost bough,
Atop on the topmost twig, -- which the pluckers forgot, somehow, --
Forget it not, nay; but got it not, for none could get it till now.

                               II
Like the wild hyacinth flower which on the hills is found,
Which the passing feet of the shepherds for ever tear and wound,
Until the purple blossom is trodden in the ground.






Her Face
 

Her face          Her tongue       Her wit 
so fair             so sweet          so sharp 
first bent         then drew         then hit 
mine eye         mine ear          my heart 

Mine eye         Mine ear          My heart 
to like             to learn            to love 
her face          her tongue       her wit 
doth lead         doth teach       doth move 

Her face          Her tongue       Her wit 
with beams      with sound       with art 
doth blind       doth charm       doth knit 
mine eye         mine ear          my heart 

Mine eye         Mine ear          My heart 
with life          with hope         with skill 
her face         her tongue       her wit 
doth feed       doth feast         doth fill 

O face            O tongue          O wit 
with frowns      with checks      with smart 
wrong not       vex not            wound not 
mine eye         mine ear          my heart 

This eye         This ear            This heart 
shall joy         shall yield          shall swear 
her face          her tongue         her wit 
to serve          to trust             to fear. 






Outbreak
 

(variations on the testimony and excommunication of Anne Hutchinson, Massachusetts Bay Colony, 1637-1638)
I. 

Given to sweet motion 
the wilderness believes 
one fair one of flowers 
to be a moral blossom. 
We go so far. Walks now, 
only legend remaining. 

"I came afterwards to the window when you was writing." 

But in their documents 
her judges had written 
                                    "Insolent." 

In its branches 
spirit shelters 
air with wailing. 
The air thunders 
unavailingly there. 

"Fear is a snare. Why should I be afraid." 

                            If I was in error 
                            but not mistaken, 
                            if my glass was gone 
                            but not broken 
                                              (defaced) 

2. 

My path illuminates 
all the interior of 
a dusky mirror, the 
left shoulder higher 
than the right is in 
memory's intricate. 

We must study distinctions aftertimes will adore. 
if the glass be taken away, we shall see more. 

God is going. Walks now, only God remaining. 


                           (wanting) 
an immediate promise He will deliver them 
(wanting)         in a day of trouble 

These emotions she retained 
in the universal heart, in 
a new eye: rational charity 
                              active piety 
                              appearing as blindness appears 
                              in the face in bright sunlight 
                              exactly like a smile. 


3. 

"Here is a great stir about graces 
and looking to hearts, but give me 
Christ. Tell me not of meditations 
and duties, but tell me of Christ." 
Christ is one thing. The soul is another 
the wild outskirt 
of the earth will 
prove the ruin of. 

And mischief, the poor babe, grew in the forest. 
                                              (defaced) 

A stick a bunch of rags a flower 
need no transformation. The hour 
given to sweet motion is a soul. 

I came to the window when God was going. 
In low condition, 
little number and 
remoteness things 

                           outbreaks of temper 
                           had a kind of value 
                           and even a comfort. 


4. 

A memory a promise or a flower sheared away 
was not made 
                     but taken from a bush of wild roses. 
Seeing them, she began to cry out for a red rose. 

"God has left me to distinguish 
between the voice of my Beloved 
and John Baptist and Antichrist." 
But daybreak unites what belongs together, 
and there are two kinds of distinction. 
There are (something wanting) 

"What he declares he does not know himself." 

I know a day of small 
and a day of infancy. 
At the window vividly 
just now and entirely 
inarticulate the form 
given to sweet motion 

broke apart and 
                         there's colors all 
kinds all round. 

5. 

Of realities surrounding us, 
their pith and substance was 
                                           wasted 
                                           wronged 
                                           misplaced. 

"I desire to speak to our teacher." 

                                           In a state of desire, 
                                           what belongs together 
                                           ignores the barriers. 

Daybreak 
have you 
any word 
your own 
or I one 
fair one 
remaining? 

God is gone, only a window and a wilderness 
remaining, not made but taken, 
thinnest fantasy of beginnings 

taken from a bush of wild red roses.





No Platonic Love
 

Tell me no more of minds embracing minds,
    And hearts exchang'd for hearts;
That spirits spirits meet, as winds do winds,
    And mix their subt'lest parts;
That two unbodied essences may kiss,
And then like Angels, twist and feel one Bliss.

I was that silly thing that once was wrought
    To practise this thin love;
I climb'd from sex to soul, from soul to thought;
    But thinking there to move,
Headlong I rolled from thought to soul, and then
From soul I lighted at the sex again.

As some strict down-looked men pretend to fast,
    Who yet in closets eat;
So lovers who profess they spirits taste,
    Feed yet on grosser meat;
I know they boast they souls to souls convey,
Howe'r they meet, the body is the way.

Come I will undeceive thee, they that tread
    Those vain aerial ways,
Are like young heirs and alchemists misled
    To waste their wealth and days,
For searching thus to be for ever rich,
They only find a med'cine for the itch.






Address to Venus
 

Delight of Human kind, and Gods above; 
Parent of Rome; Propitious Queen of Love; 
Whose vital pow'r, Air, Earth, and Sea supplies; 
And breeds what e'r is born beneath the rowling Skies: 
For every kind, by thy prolifique might,   
Springs, and beholds the Regions of the light: 
Thee, Goddess thee, the clouds and tempests fear, 
And at thy pleasing presence disappear: 
For thee the Land in fragrant Flow'rs is drest, 
For thee the Ocean smiles, and smooths her wavy breast; 
And Heav'n it self with more serene, and purer light is blest. 
For when the rising Spring adorns the Mead, 
And a new Scene of Nature stands display'd, 
When teeming Budds, and chearful greens appear, 
And Western gales unlock the lazy year, 
The joyous Birds thy welcome first express, 
Whose native Songs thy genial fire confess: 
Then savage Beasts bound o're their slighted food, 
Strook with thy darts, and tempt the raging floud: 
All Nature is thy Gift; Earth, Air, and Sea: 
Of all that breathes, the various progeny, 
Stung with delight, is goaded on by thee. 
O'er barren Mountains, o'er the flow'ry Plain, 
The leavy Forest, and the liquid Main 
Extends thy uncontroul'd and boundless reign. 
Through all the living Regions dost thou move, 
And scattr'st, where thou goest, the kindly seeds of Love: 
Since then the race of every living thing, 
Obeys thy pow'r; since nothing new can spring 
Without thy warmth, without thy influence bear, 
Or beautiful, or lovesome can appear, 
Be thou my ayd: My tuneful Song inspire, 
And kindle with thy own productive fire; 
While all thy Province Nature, I survey, 
And sing to Memmius an immortal lay 
Of Heav'n, and Earth, and every where thy wond'rous pow'r display. 
To Memmius, under thy sweet influence born, 
Whom thou with all thy gifts and graces dost adorn. 
The rather, then assist my Muse and me, 
Infusing Verses worthy him and thee. 
Mean time on Land and Sea let barb'rous discord cease, 
And lull the listening world in universal peace. 
To thee, Mankind their soft repose must owe, 
For thou alone that blessing canst bestow; 
Because the brutal business of the War 
Is manag'd by thy dreadful Servant's care: 
Who oft retires from fighting fields, to prove 
The pleasing pains of thy eternal Love: 
And panting on thy breast, supinely lies, 
While with thy heavenly form he feeds his famish'd eyes: 
Sucks in with open lips, thy balmy breath, 
By turns restor'd to life, and plung'd in pleasing death. 
There while thy curling limbs about him move, 
Involv'd and fetter'd in the links of Love, 
When wishing all, he nothing can deny, 
Thy charms in that auspicious moment try; 
With winning eloquence our peace implore, 
And quiet to the weary World restore. 






Sonnet: "Upon a day, came Sorrow in to me
 

on the 9th of June 1290
Upon a day, came Sorrow in to me, 
         Saying, I've come to stay with thee a while'; 
         And I perceived that she had ushered Bile 
And Pain into my house for company. 
Wherefore I said, Go forth  away with thee!' 
         But like a Greek she answered, full of guile, 
         And went on arguing in an easy style. 
Then, looking, I saw Love come silently, 
Habited in black raiment, smooth and new, 
         Having a black hat set upon his hair; 
And certainly the tears he shed were true. 
         So that I asked, What ails thee, trifler?' 
Answering, he said: A grief to be gone through; 
         For our own lady's dying, brother dear.' 






The Dream of a Lover
 

Benedicite! whate dreamed I this nyght?
Methought the worlde was turnyd up so downe
The sun, the moone had lost their force and lyght,
The sea also drowned both toure and towne.
Yet more marvel how that I heard the sounde
Of onys voice saying: beare in thy mynd,
Thi lady hath forgotten to be kynd.






A Face
 

If one could have that little head of hers       

    Painted upon a background of pale gold,         

Such as the Tuscan's early art prefers!         

    No shade encroaching on the matchless mould         

Of those two lips, which should be opening soft                     

    In the pure profile; not as when she laughs,         

For that spoils all: but rather as if aloft         

    Yon hyacinth, she loves so, leaned its staff's         

Burthen of honey-coloured buds to kiss         

And capture 'twixt the lips apart for this.

Then her lithe neck, three fingers might surround,         

How it should waver on the pale gold ground,         

Up to the fruit-shaped, perfect chin it lifts!         

I know, Correggio loves to mass, in rifts         

Of heaven, his angel faces, orb on orb

Breaking its outline, burning shades absorb:         

But these are only massed there, I should think,         

    Waiting to see some wonder momently         

    Grow out, stand full, fade slow against the sky         

    (That's the pale ground you'd see this sweet face by),

    All heaven, meanwhile, condensed into one eye         

Which fears to lose the wonder, should it wink.







"How can I keep my maidenhead"
 

How can I keep my maidenhead, 
    My maidenhead, my maidenhead; 
How can I keep my maidenhead, 
    Among sae mony men, O. 

The Captain bad a guinea for't, 
    A guinea for't, a guinea for't, 
The Captain bad a guinea for't, 
    The Colonel he bad ten, O. 

But I'll do as my minnie did, 
    My minnie did, my minnie did, 
But I'll do as my minnie did, 
    For siller I'll hae nane, O. 

I'll gie it to a bonie lad, 
    A bonie lad, a bonie lad; 
I'll gie it to a bonie lad, 
    For just as gude again, O. 

An auld moulie maidenhead, 
    A maidenhead, a maidenhead; 
An auld moulie maidenhead, 
    The weary wark I ken, O. 

The stretchin' o't, the strivin' o't, 
    The borin o't, the rivin' o't, 
And ay the double drivin o't, 
    The farther ye gang ben, O. 






"John Anderson my jo, John"
 

John Anderson my jo, John, 
    When we were first acquent, 
Your locks were like the raven, 
      Your bonie brow was brent; 
But now your brow is beld, John, 
      Your locks are like the snaw, 
but blessings on your frosty pow, 
      John Anderson, my jo! 

John Anderson my jo, John, 
      We clamb the hill thegither, 
And monie a cantie day, John, 
      We've had wi' ane anither; 
Now we maun totter down, John, 
      And hand in hand we'll go, 
And sleep thegither at the foot, 
      John Anderson, my jo! 






Sestina of the Lady Pietra degli Scrovigni
 

To the dim light and the large circle of shade 
I have clomb, and to the whitening of the hills, 
There where we see no color in the grass. 
Natheless my longing loses not its green, 
It has so taken root in the hard stone 
Which talks and hears as though it were a lady. 

Utterly frozen is this youthful lady, 
Even as the snow that lies within the shade; 
For she is no more moved than is the stone 
By the sweet season which makes warm the hills 
And alters them afresh from white to green 
Covering their sides again with flowers and grass. 

When on her hair she sets a crown of grass 
The thought has no more room for other lady, 
Because she weaves the yellow with the green 
So well that Love sits down there in the shade, 
Love who has shut me in among low hills 
Faster than between walls of granite-stone. 

She is more bright than is a precious stone; 
The wound she gives may not be healed with grass: 
I therefore have fled far o'er plains and hills 
For refuge from so dangerous a lady; 
But from her sunshine nothing can give shade, 
Not any hill, nor wall, nor summer-green. 

A while ago, I saw her dressed in green, 
So fair, she might have wakened in a stone 
This love which I do feel even for her shade; 
And therefore, as one woos a graceful lady, 
I wooed her in a field that was all grass 
Girdled about with very lofty hills. 

Yet shall the streams turn back and climb the hills 
Before Love's flame in this damp wood and green 
Burn, as it burns within a youthful lady, 
For my sake, who would sleep away in stone 
My life, or feed like beasts upon the grass, 
Only to see her garments cast a shade. 

How dark soe'er the hills throw out their shade, 
Under her summer green the beautiful lady 
Covers it, like a stone cover'd in grass. 






"Dear, if you change, I'll never choose again"
 

Dear, if you change, I'll never choose again; 
Sweet, if you shrink, I'll never think of love;
Fair, if you fail, I'll judge all beauty vain;
Wise, if too weak, more wits I'll never prove.
Dear, sweet, fair, wise,-change, shrink, nor be not weak;
And on my faith, my faith shall never break.

Earth with her flowers shall sooner heaven adorn;
Heaven her bright stars through, earth's dim globe shall move;
Fire heat shall lose, and frosts of flame be born;
Air, made to shine, as black as hell shall prove:
Earth, heaven, fire, air, the world transformed shall view,
Ere I prove false to faith, or strange to you. 






Song: Why should a foolish marriage vow
 

                        I


Why should a foolish marriage vow,

   Which long ago was made,

Oblige us to each other now,

   When passion is decayed?

We loved, and we loved, as long as we could,

   Till our love was loved out in us both;

But our marriage is dead, when the pleasure is fled:

'Twas pleasure first made it an oath.


                      II


If I have pleasures for a friend,

   And further love in store,

What wrong has he, whose joys did end,

   And who could give no more?

'Tis a madness that he should be jealous of me,

 Or that I should bar him of another:

For all we can gain, is to give ourselves pain,

   When neither can hinder the other.







The Microcosm
 

    Man of himself's a little world, but join'd
With woman, woman for that end design'd,
(Hear cruel fair one whilst I this rehearse!)
He makes up then a complete universe.
    Man, like this sublunary world, is born
The sport of two cross planets, love, and scorn:
Woman the other world resembles well,
In whose looks Heav'n is, in whose breast Hell.






Rain on a Grave
 

Clouds spout upon her

    Their waters amain

    In ruthless disdain, 

Her who but lately

    Had shivered with pain 

As at touch of dishonour

If there had lit on her

So coldly, so straightly

    Such arrows of rain:


One who to shelter

    Her delicate head

Would quicken and quicken

    Each tentative tread

If drops chanced to pelt her

    That summertime spills

    In dust-paven rills

When thunder-clouds thicken

    And birds close their bills.


Would that I lay there

    And she were housed here!

Or better, together

Were folded away there

Exposed to one weather

We both,  who would stray there 

When sunny the day there, 

    Or evening was clear

    At the prime of the year.


Soon will be growing

    Green blades from her mound,

And daisies be showing

    Like stars on the ground,

Till she form part of them  

Ay  the sweet heart of them,

Loved beyond measure

With a child's pleasure

    All her life's round.







The Echo Elf Answers
 

How much shall I love her?

For life, or not long?

                Not long.


Alas! When forget her?

In years, or by June?

                By June.


And whom woo I after?

No one, or a throng?

                A throng.


Of these shall I wed one

Long hence, or quite soon?

                Quite soon.


And which will my bride be?

The right or the wrong?

                The wrong.


And my remedy  what kind?

Wealth-wove, or earth-hewn?

                Earth-hewn.







Neutral Tones
 

We stood by a pond that winter day,

And the sun was white, as though chidden of God,

And a few leaves lay on the starving sod;

          They had fallen from an ash, and were gray.


Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove

Over tedious riddles of years ago;

And some words played between us to and fro

         On which lost the more by our love.


The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing

Alive enough to have strength to die;

And a grin of bitterness swept thereby

         Like an ominous bird a-wing.


Since then, keen lessons that love deceives,

And wrings with wrong, have shaped to me

Your face, and the God curst sun, and a tree,

         And a pond edged with grayish leaves.







A Broken Appointment
 

         You did not come,

And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb,--

Yet less for loss of your dear presence there

Than that I thus found lacking in your make

That high compassion which can overbear

Reluctance for pure lovingkindness' sake

Grieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum,

         You did not come.


         You love not me,

And love alone can lend you loyalty;

I know and knew it. But, unto the store

Of human deeds divine in all but name,

Was it not worth a little hour or more

To add yet this: Once you, a woman, came

To soothe a time-torn man; even though it be

         You love not me?







The Chosen
 

A woman for whom great gods might strive!

      I said, and kissed her there:

And then I thought of the other five,

      And of how charms outwear.


I thought of the first with her eating eyes,

And I thought of the second with hers, green-gray,

And I thought of the third, experienced, wise,

And I thought of the fourth who sang all day.


And I thought of the fifth, whom I'd called a jade.

      And I thought of them all, tear-fraught;

And that each had shown her a passable maid,

      Yet not of the favour sought.


So I traced these words on the bark of a beech,

Just at the falling of the mast:

After scanning five; yes, each and each,

I've found the woman desired  at last!


I feel a strange benumbing spell,

      As one ill-wished! said she.

And soon it seemed that something fell

      Was starving her love for me.


I feel some curse. O, five were there?

And wanly she swerved, and went away.

I followed sick: night numbed the air,

And dark the mournful moorland lay.


I cried: O darling, turn your head!

      But never her face I viewed;

O turn, O turn! again I said,

      And miserably pursued.


At length I came to a Christ-cross stone

Which she had passed without discern;

And I knelt upon the leaves there strown,

And prayed aloud that she might turn.


I rose, and looked; and turn she did;

      I cried, My heart revives!

Look more, she said. I looked as bid;

      Her face was all the five's.


All the five women, clear come back,

I saw in her  with her made one,

The while she drooped upon the track,

And her frail term seemed well-nigh run.


She'd half forgot me in her change;

      Who are you? Won't you say

Who you may be, you man so strange,

      Following since yesterday?


I took the composite form she was,

And carried her to an arbour small,

Not passion-moved, but even because

In one I could atone to all.


And there she lies, and there I tend,

      Till my life's threads unwind,

A various womanhood in blend 

      Not one, but all combined.





The Haunter
 

He does not think that I haunt here nightly:

    How shall I let him know

That whither his fancy sets him wandering

    I, too, alertly go? -

Hover and hover a few feet from him

    Just as I used to do,

But cannot answer the words he lifts me 

    Only listen thereto!


When I could answer he did not say them:

    When I could let him know

How I would like to join in his journeys

    Seldom he wished to go.

Now that he goes and wants me with him

    More than he used to do,

Never he sees my faithful phantom

    Though he speaks thereto.


Yes, I companion him to places

    Only dreamers know,

Where the shy hares print long paces,

    Where the night rooks go;

Into old aisles where the past is all to him,

    Close as his shade can do,

Always lacking the power to call to him,

    Near as I reach thereto!


What a good haunter I am, O tell him,

    Quickly make him know

If he but sigh since my loss befell him

    Straight to his side I go.

Tell him a faithful one is doing

    All that love can do

Still that his path may be worth pursuing,

    And to bring peace thereto.








The Phantom Horsewoman
 

                                  I


Queer are the ways of a man I know: 

             He comes and stands 

             In a careworn craze, 

             And looks at the sands 

             And the seaward haze 

             With moveless hands 

             And face and gaze, 

             Then turns to go... 

And what does he see when he gazes so? 


                                  II


They say he sees as an instant thing 

             More clear than to-day, 

             A sweet soft scene 

             That once was in play 

             By that briny green; 

             Yes, notes alway 

             Warm, real, and keen, 

             What his back years bring--

A phantom of his own figuring. 


                                  III


Of this vision of his they might say more: 

             Not only there 

             Does he see this sight, 

             But everywhere 

             In his brainday, night, 

             As if on the air 

             It were drawn rose bright 

             Yea, far from that shore 

Does he carry this vision of heretofore: 


                                  IV


A ghost-girl-rider. And though, toil-tried, 

             He withers daily, 

             Time touches her not, 

             But she still rides gaily 

             In his rapt thought 

             On that shagged and shaly 

             Atlantic spot, 

             And as when first eyed 

Draws rein and sings to the swing of the tide.







Love's Good-Morrow
 

Pack, clouds away! and welcome day!
    With night we banish sorrow;
Sweet air, blow soft, mount larks aloft
    To give my love good-morrow!
Wings from the wind to please her mind,
    Notes from the lark I'll borrow;
Bird, prune thy wing, nightingale, sing,
    To give my love good-morrow;
    To give my love good-morrow;
    Notes from them both I'll borrow.

Wake from thy nest, Robin Redbreast, 
    Sing birds in every furrow;
And from each hill, let music shrill
    Give my fair love good-morrow!
Blackbird and thrush in every bush,
    Stare, linnet, and cock-sparrow!
You pretty elves, amongst yourselves,
    Sing my fair love good-morrow;
    To give my love good-morrow,
    Sing birds in every furrow.






In the Valley of the Elwy
 

I remember a house where all were good 
   To me, God knows, deserving no such thing: 
   Comforting smell breathed at very entering, 
Fetched fresh, as I suppose, off some sweet wood. 
That cordial air made those kind people a hood 
   All over, as a bevy of eggs the mothering wing 
   Will, or mild nights the new morsels of Spring: 
Why, it seemed of course; seemed of right it should. 

Lovely the woods, waters, meadows, combes, vales, 
All the air things wear that build this world of Wales; 
   Only the inmate does not correspond: 
God, lover of souls, swaying considerate scales, 
Complete thy creature dear O where it fails, 
   Being mighty a master, being a father and fond. 






At the Wedding March
 

God with honour hang your head, 
Groom, and grace you, bride, your bed 
With lissome scions, sweet scions, 
Out of hallowed bodies bred. 

Each be other's comfort kind: 
Dep, deper than divined, 
Divine charity, dear charity, 
Fast you ever, fast bind. 

Then let the March tread our ears: 
I to him turn with tears   
Who to wedlock, his wonder wedlock, 
Dals trumph and immortal years.   





Ode I, 5: To Pyrrha
 

What slender youth, bedew'd with liquid odors, 
Courts thee on roses in some pleasant cave, 
             Pyrrha? For whom bind'st thou 
             In wreaths thy golden hair, 
Plain in thy neatness? O how oft shall he 
Of faith and changed gods complain, and seas 
             Rough with black winds, and storms 
             Unwonted shall admire! 
Who now enjoys thee credulous, all gold, 
Who, always vacant, always amiable 
             Hopes thee, of flattering gales 
             Unmindful. Hapless they 
To whom thou untried seem'st fair. Me, in my vow'd 
Picture, the sacred wall declares to have hung 
             My dank and dropping weeds 
             To the stern god of sea. 






Modern Love
 

And what is love? It is a doll dress'd up

For idleness to cosset, nurse, and dandle;

A thing of soft misnomers, so divine

That silly youth doth think to make itself

Divine by loving, and so goes on 

Yawning and doting a whole summer long,

Till Miss's comb is made a pearl tiara,

And common Wellingtons turn Romeo boots;

Then Cleopatra lives at number seven,

And Antony resides in Brunswick Square.

Fools! if some passions high have warm'd the world,

If Queens and Soldiers have play'd deep for hearts, 

It is no reason why such agonies

Should be more common than the growth of weeds.

Fools! make me whole again that weighty pearl

The Queen of Egypt melted, and I'll say 

That ye may love in spite of beaver hats.   







"The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!"
 

The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!

   Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast,

Warm breath, light whisper, tender semi-tone,

   Bright eyes, accomplish'd shape, and lang'rous waist!

Faded the flower and all its budded charms,

   Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes,

Faded the shape of beauty from my arms,

   Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradise 

Vanish'd unseasonably at shut of eve,

   When the dusk holiday  or holinight

Of fragrant-curtain'd love begins to weave

   The woof of darkness thick, for hid delight,

But, as I've read love's missal through to-day,

He'll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray. 







"This living hand, now warm and capable"
 

This living hand, now warm and capable

Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold

And in the icy silence of the tomb,

So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights

That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood

So in my veins red life might stream again,

And thou be conscience-calm'dsee here it is 

I hold it towards you. 







On a Dream
 

As Hermes once took to his feathers light,

    When lulled Argus, baffled, swoon'd and slept,

So on a Delphic reed, my idle spright

    So play'd, so charm'd, so conquer'd, so bereft

The dragon-world of all its hundred eyes;

    And seeing it asleep, so fled away,

Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies,

    Nor unto Tempe where Jove griev'd that day;

But to that second circle of sad Hell,

    Where in the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw

Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell

    Their sorrows--pale were the sweet lips I saw,

Pale were the lips I kiss'd, and fair the form

I floated with, about that melancholy storm. 







The Scrutinie
 

                            I

Why should you sweare I am forsworn,
   Since thine I vow'd to be?
Lady it is already Morn,
   And 'twas last night I swore to thee
That fond impossibility.

                            II

Have I not lov'd thee much and long,
   A tedious twelve houres space?
I must all other Beauties wrong,
   And rob thee of a new imbrace;
Could I still dote upon thy Face.

                            III

Not, but all joy in thy browne haire,
   By others may be found;
But I must search the blank and faire
   Like skilfull Minerallist's that sound
For Treasure in un-plow'd-up ground.

                            IV

Then, if when I have lov'd my round,
   Thou prov'st the pleasant she;
With spoyles of meaner Beauties crown'd,
   I laden will returne to thee,
Ev'd sated with Varietie.





Modern Love: XLVII
 

Their sense is with their senses all mixed in,
Destroyed by subtleties these women are!
More brain, O Lord, more brain! or we shall mar
Utterly this fair garden we might win.
Behold! I looked for peace, and thought it near.
Our inmost hearts had opened, each to each.
We drank the pure daylight of honest speech.
Alas! that was the fatal draught, I fear.
For when of my lost Lady came the word, 
This woman, O this agony of flesh!
Jealous devotion bade her break the mesh,
That I might seek that other like a bird.
I do adore the nobleness! despise 
The act! She has gone forth, I know not where.
Will the hard world my sentience of her share?
I feel the truth; so let the world surmise.






Modern Love: XLIX
 

He found her by the ocean's moaning verge,
Nor any wicked change in her discerned;
And she believed his old love had returned,
Which was her exultation, and her scourge.
She took his hand, and walked with him, and seemed
The wife he sought, though shadow-like and dry.
She had one terror, lest her heart should sigh,
And tell her loudly that she no longer dreamed.
She dared not say, This is my breast: look in.'
But there's a strength to help the desperate weak.
That night he learned how silence best can speak
The awful things when Pity pleads for Sin.
About the middle of the night her call 
Was heard, and he came wondering to the bed.
Now kiss me, dear! it may be, now!' she said.
Lethe had passed those lips, and he knew all. 






Modern Love: IX
 

He felt the wild beast in him betweenwhiles
So masterfully rude, that he would grieve
To see the helpless delicate thing receive
His guardianship through certain dark defiles.
Had he not teeth to rend, and hunger too?
But still he spared her. Once: Have you no fear?'
He said: 'twas dusk; she in his grasp; none near.
She laughed: No, surely; am I not with you?'
And uttering that soft starry you,' she leaned
Her gentle body near him, looking up;
And from her eyes, as from a poison-cup,
He drank until the flittering eyelids screened.
Devilish malignant witch! and oh, young beam
Of heaven's circle-glory! Here they shape
To squeeze like an intoxicating grape  
I might, and yet thou goest safe, supreme.






Modern Love: VIII
 

Yet it was plain she struggled, and that salt
Of righteous feeling made her pitiful.
Poor twisting worm, so queenly beautiful!
Where came the cleft between us? whose the fault?
My tears are on thee, that have rarely dropped
As balm for any bitter wound of mine:
My breast will open for thee at a sign!
But, no: we are two reed-pipes, coarsely stopped:
The God once filled them with his mellow breath;
And they were music till he flung them down,
Used! used! Hear now the discord-loving clown
Puff his gross spirit in them, worse than death!
I do not know myself without thee more:
In this unholy battle I grow base:
If the same soul be under the same face, 
Speak, and a taste of that old time restore!






If no love is, O God, what fele I so?
 

If no love is, O God, what fele I so?
    And if love is, what thing and which is he?
    If love be good, from whennes cometh my woo?
    If it be wikke, a wonder thynketh me,
    When every torment and adversite
    That cometh of hym, may to me savory thinke,
    For ay thurst I, the more that ich it drynke.
And if that at myn owen lust I brenne,
    From whennes cometh my waillynge and my pleynte?
    If harm agree me, whereto pleyne I thenne?
    I noot, ne whi unwery that I feynte.
    O quike deth, O swete harm so queynte,
    How may of the in me swich quantite,
    But if that I consente that it be?
And if that I consente, I wrongfully
    Compleyne, iwis.   Thus possed to and fro,
    Al sterelees withinne a boot am I
    Amydde the see, betwixen wyndes two,
    That in contrarie stonden evere mo.
    Allas! what is this wondre maladie?
    For hete of cold, for cold of hete, I dye. 






"Alas, so all things now do hold their peace!"
 

Alas, so all things now do hold their peace! 
   Heaven and earth disturbd in no thing; 
The beasts, the air, the birds their song do cease, 
   The nights car the stars about doth bring; 
Calm is the sea; the waves work less and less: 
   So am not I, whom love, alas! doth wring, 
Bringing before my face the great increase 
   Of my desires, whereat I weep and sing, 
In joy and woe, as in a doubtful case. 
   For my sweet thoughts sometime do pleasure bring: 
But by and by, the cause of my disease 
   Gives me a pang that inwardly doth sting, 
When that I think what grief it is again 
To live and lack the thing should rid my pain.    






A Farewell to False Love
 

Farewell, false love, the oracle of lies, 

A mortal foe and enemy to rest, 

An envious boy, from whom all cares arise, 

A bastard vile, a beast with rage possessed, 

A way of error, a temple full of treason, 

In all effects contrary unto reason. 


A poisoned serpent covered all with flowers, 

Mother of sighs, and murderer of repose, 

A sea of sorrows whence are drawn such showers 

As moisture lend to every grief that grows; 

A school of guile, a net of deep deceit, 

A gilded hook that holds a poisoned bait. 


A fortress foiled, which reason did defend, 

A siren song, a fever of the mind, 

A maze wherein affection finds no end, 

A raging cloud that runs before the wind, 

A substance like the shadow of the sun, 

A goal of grief for which the wisest run. 


A quenchless fire, a nurse of trembling fear, 

A path that leads to peril and mishap, 

A true retreat of sorrow and despair, 

An idle boy that sleeps in pleasure's lap, 

A deep mistrust of that which certain seems, 

A hope of that which reason doubtful deems. 


Sith then thy trains my younger years betrayed, 

And for my faith ingratitude I find; 

And sith repentance hath my wrongs bewrayed,

Whose course was ever contrary to kind: 

False love, desire, and beauty frail, adieu! 

Dead is the root whence all these fancies grew.







Sonnet 138: When my love swears that she is made of truth
 

When my love swears that she is made of truth, 
I do believe her, though I know she lies, 
That she might think me some untutored youth, 
Unlearnd in the world's false subtleties. 
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, 
Although she knows my days are past the best, 
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue: 
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed. 
But wherefore says she not she is unjust? 
And wherefore say not I that I am old? 
Oh, love's best habit is in seeming trust, 
And age in love loves not to have years told. 
    Therefore I lie with her and she with me, 
    And in our faults by lies we flattered be.





Sonnet 104: To me, fair friend, you never can be old
 

To me, fair friend, you never can be old, 
For as you were when first your eye I eyed, 
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold 
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride, 
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned 
In process of the seasons have I seen, 
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned, 
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green. 
Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand, 
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived; 
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand, 
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived: 
For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred: 
Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.





Sonnet 57: Being your slave, what should I do but tend
 

Being your slave, what should I do but tend 
Upon the hours and times of your desire? 
I have no precious time at all to spend, 
Nor services to do, till you require. 
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour 
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you. 
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour 
When you have bid your servant once adieu; 
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought 
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose, 
But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought, 
Save, where you are how happy you make those. 
So true a fool is love that in your will 
Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.





Womanhood, wanton, ye want
 

Womanhood, wanton, ye want:
   Your meddling, mistress, is mannerless;
Plenty of ill, of goodness scant,
   Ye rail at riot, reckless:
To praise your port it is needless;
For all your draff yet and your dregs,
As well borne as ye full oft time begs.

Why so coy and full of scorn?
   Mine horse is sold, I ween, you say;
My new furrd gown, when it is worn
   Put up your purse, ye shall not pay!
   By crede, I trust to see the day,
As proud a pea-hen as ye spread,
Of me and other ye may have need!

Though angelic be your smiling,
   Yet is your tongue an adder's tail,
Full like a scorpion stinging
   All those by whom ye have avail.
   Good mistress Anne, there ye do shail:
What prate ye, pretty pigesnye?
I trust to 'quite you ere I die!

Your key is meet for every lock,
   Your key is common and hangeth out;
Your key is ready, we need not knock,
   Nor stand long wresting there about;
   Of your door-gate ye have no doubt:
But one thing is, that ye be lewd:
Hold your tongue now, all beshrewd!

To mistress Anne, that farly sweet,
That wones at The Key in Thames Street.







Market Womens Cries
 

APPLES 

         Come buy my fine wares, 
         Plums, apples and pears. 
         A hundred a penny, 
         In conscience too many: 
         Come, will you have any? 
         My children are seven, 
         I wish them in Heaven; 
         My husband's a sot, 
         With his pipe and his pot, 
         Not a farthen will gain them, 
         And I must maintain them. 

                           ONIONS 

         Come, follow me by the smell, 
         Here are delicate onions to sell; 
         I promise to use you well. 
         They make the blood warmer, 
         You'll feed like a farmer; 
For this is every cook's opinion, 
No savoury dish without an onion; 
But, lest your kissing should be spoiled, 
Your onions must be thoroughly boiled: 
         Or else you may spare 
         Your mistress a share, 
The secret will never be known: 
         She cannot discover 
         The breath of her lover, 
But think it as sweet as her own. 

                           HERRINGS 

         Be not sparing, 
         Leave off swearing. 
         Buy my herring 
         Fresh from Malahide, 
         Better never was tried. 
Come, eat them with pure fresh butter and mustard, 
Their bellies are soft, and as white as a custard. 
Come, sixpence a dozen, to get me some bread, 
Or, like my own herrings, I soon shall be dead. 






Dead Love
 

Dead love, by treason slain, lies stark, 
White as a dead stark-stricken dove: 
None that pass by him pause to mark 
         Dead love. 

His heart, that strained and yearned and strove 
As toward the sundawn strives the lark, 
Is cold as all the old joy thereof. 

Dead men, re-arisen from dust, may hark 
When rings the trumpet blown above: 
It will not raise from out the dark 
         Dead love. 






A Cameo
 

There was a graven image of Desire 
      Painted with red blood on a ground of gold 
      Passing between the young men and the old, 
And by him Pain, whose body shone like fire, 
And Pleasure with gaunt hands that grasped their hire. 
      Of his left wrist, with fingers clenched and cold, 
      The insatiable Satiety kept hold, 
Walking with feet unshod that pashed the mire. 
The senses and the sorrows and the sins, 
      And the strange loves that suck the breasts of Hate 
Till lips and teeth bite in their sharp indenture, 
Followed like beasts with flap of wings and fins. 
      Death stood aloof behind a gaping grate, 
Upon whose lock was written Peradventure.





"Out of the rolling ocean the crowd"
 

Out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me,

Whispering, I love you, before long I die,

I have travell'd a long way merely to look on you to touch you,

For I could not die till I once look'd on you,

For I fear'd I might afterward lose you. 


Now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe,

Return in peace to the ocean my love,

I too am part of that ocean, my love, we are not so much separated,

Behold the great rondure, the cohesion of all, how perfect!

But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,

As for an hour carrying us diverse, yet cannot carry us diverse forever;

Be not impatient  a little space  know you I salute the air, the ocean and the land,

Every day at sundown for your dear sake, my love.







"Are you the new person drawn toward me?"
 

Are you the new person drawn toward me?

To begin with, take warning, I am surely far different from what you suppose;

Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal?

Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover?

Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloy'd satisfaction?

Do you think I am trusty and faithful?

Do you see no further than this faade, this smooth and tolerant manner of me?

Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man?

Have you no thought, O dreamer, that it may be all maya, illusion?







"Why art thou silent!  Is thy love a plant"
 

Why art thou silent! Is thy love a plant
Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air
Of absence withers what was once so fair?
Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?
Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant--
Bound to thy service with unceasing care,
The mind's least generous wish a mendicant
For nought but what thy happiness could spare.
Speak-- though this soft warm heart, once free to hold
A thousand tender pleasures, thine and mine,
Be left more desolate, more dreary cold
Than a forsaken bird's-nest filled with snow
Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine--
Speak, that my torturing doubts their end may know.






Modern Love XXX
 

What are we first? First, animals; and next   
Intelligences at a leap; on whom   
Pale lies the distant shadow of the tomb,   
And all that draweth on the tomb for text.   
Into which state comes Love, the crowning sun:   
Beneath whose light the shadow loses form.   
We are the lords of life, and life is warm.   
Intelligence and instinct now are one.   
But nature says: "My children most they seem   
When they least know me: therefore I decree   
That they shall suffer." Swift doth young Love flee,   
And we stand wakened, shivering from our dream.   
Then if we study Nature we are wise.   
Thus do the few who live but with the day:   
The scientific animals are they-- 
Lady, this is my sonnet to your eyes.





Earth Upon Earth
 

Earth took of earth, earth with woe, 
Earth other earth to the earth added; 
Earth laid earth in an earthen grave. 
Then had earth of earth enough earth. 






"Now Goeth Sun Under Wood"
 

Now goth sonne under wod: 
Me reweth, Marye, thy faire rode. 
Now goth sonne under tree:   
Me reweth, Marye, thy sone and thee. 






"I Have a Young Sister"
 

I have a yong suster 
Fer beyonden the se, 
Many be the drowryes 
That she sente me. 

She sente me the cherye 
Withouten ony ston;   
And so she dede the dove 
Withouten ony bon. 

She sente me the brer 
Withouten ony rinde; 
She bad me love my lemman 
Withoute longing. 

How shuld ony cherye 
Be withoute ston? 
And how shuld ony dove 
Be withoute bon? 

How shuld ony brer 
Been withoute rinde? 
How shuld I love myn lemman 
Withoute longing? 

Whan the cherye was a flowr 
Than hadde it non ston. 
When the dove was an ey 
Than hadde it non bon. 

When the brer was onbred 
Than hadde it non rind. 
Whan the maiden hath that she loveth 
She is without longing. 








The Unquiet Grave
 

The wind doth blow today, my love,         
    And a few small drops of rain;         
I never had but one true-love,         
    In cold grave she was lain.         

I'll do as much for my true-love
    As any young man may;         
I'll sit and mourn all at her grave         
    For a twelvemonth and a day.

The twelvemonth and a day being up,         
    The dead began to speak:            
Oh who sits weeping on my grave,
    And will not let me sleep?

'T is I, my love, sits on your grave,         
    And will not let you sleep;         
For I crave one kiss of your clay-cold lips,
    And that is all I seek.

You crave one kiss of my clay-cold lips,         
    But my breath smells earthy strong;         
If you have one kiss of my clay-cold lips,         
    Your time will not be long.

'T is down in yonder garden green,         
    Love, where we used to walk,         
The finest flower that e're was seen         
    Is withered to a stalk.         

The stalk is withered dry, my love,
    So will our hearts decay;         
So make yourself content, my love,         
    Till God calls you away.





"Weep You No More, Sad Fountains"
 

Weep you no more, sad fountains; 
   What need you flow so fast? 
Look how the snowy mountains 
   Heaven's sun doth gently waste. 
   But my sun's heavenly eyes 
       View not your weeping,
       That now lie sleeping
   Softly, now softly lies 
            Sleeping. 

Sleep is a reconciling, 
   A rest that peace begets. 
Doth not the sun rise smiling 
   When fair at even he sets?
   Rest you then, rest, sad eyes, 
       Melt not in weeping 
       While she lies sleeping
Softly, now softly lies 
            Sleeping.






The Silver Swan
 

The silver swan, who living had no note, 
When death approached, unlocked her silent throat; 
Leaning her breast against the reedy shore, 
Thus sung her first and last, and sung no more: 
"Farewell, all joys; Oh death, come close mine eyes; 
More geese than swans now live, more fools than wise.





The Song of Lewes
 

   Sitteth alle stille and herkneth to me!
   The King of Alemaigne, by mi leaute, 
Thritty thousand pound askede he 
For to make the pees in the countre--
And so he dude more.

With hare sharpe swerdes he grounde the stel-- 
He wende that the sailes were mangonel

Jesus, My Sweet Lover
 

Jesu Christ, my lemmon swete,
That diyedest on the Rode Tree,
With all my might I thee beseche,
For thy woundes two and three,
That also faste mot thy love
Into mine herte fitched be
As was the spere into thine herte,
Whon thou soffredest deth for me.





Jesus Comforts His Mother
 

A baby is borne us blis to bring;
A maidden, I hard, Loullay, sing: 
Dere son, now leive thy wepping,
Thy fadere is the King of Blis.

Nay! Dere modere, for you weppe I noght,
But for thinges that shall be wroght,
Or that I have mankind iboght.
Was ther never pain like it, iwis.

Pes! dere sone, say thou me not so.
Thou art my child, I have no mo.
Alas! That I shuld see this wo:
It were to me gret heivynis.

My hondes, modere, that ye now see,
Thay shall be nailed one a tree;
My feit, also, fastned shall be: 
Full mony shall wepe that it shall see.

Alas! dere son, sorrow now is my happe
To see my child that soukes my pappe
So ruthfully taken out of my lappe.
It were to me gret heivynis.

Also, modere, ther shall a speire
My tendere hert all to-teire:
The blud shall kevere my body there.
Gret ruthe it shall be to see.

A! dere sone, that is a heivy cas.
When Gabrell knelled before my face
And said, Heille! Lady, full of grace,'
He never told me nothing of this.

Dere modere, pes!   Nowe I you pray,
And take no sorrow for that I say, 
But singe this song, By, by, loullay,'
To drive away all heivynis.





Remembrance
 

They flee from me, that sometime did me seek 
    With naked foot, stalking in my chamber. 
I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek, 
    That now are wild, and do not remember 
    That sometime they put themselves in danger 
         To take bread at my hand; and now they range 
         Busily seeking with a continual change. 

Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise 
    Twenty times better; but once, in special, 
In thin array, after a pleasant guise, 
    When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall, 
    And she me caught in her arms long and small; 
         Therewith all sweetly did me kiss, 
         And softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?' 

It was no dream: I lay broad waking: 
    But all is turned, thorough my gentleness, 
Into a strange fashion of forsaking; 
    And I have leave to go of her goodness, 
    And she also to use newfangleness. 
         But since that I so kindly am served, 
         I would fain know what she hath deserved. 






Amoretti IV:  "New yeare forth looking out of Janus gate"
 

New yeare forth looking out of Janus gate,
Doth seeme to promise hope of new delight:
And bidding th'old Adieu, his passd date
Bids all old thoughts to die in dumpish spright
And calling forth out of sad Winters night,
Fresh love, that long hath slept in cheerlesse bower:
Wils him awake, and soone about him dight
His wanton wings and darts of deadly power.
For lusty spring now in his timely howre,
Is ready to come forth him to receive:
And warnes the Earth with divers colord flowre,
To decke hir selfe, and her faire mantle weave.
Then you faire flowre, in whom fresh youth doth raine,
Prepare your selfe new love to entertaine.





Amoretti XIII:  "In that proud port, which her so goodly graceth"
 

In that proud port, which her so goodly graceth, 
Whiles her faire face she reares up to the skie: 
And to the ground her eie lids low embaseth 
Most goodly temperature ye may descry, 
Myld humblesse mixt with awfull majesty, 
For looking on the earth whence she was borne: 
Her minde remembreth her mortalitie, 
What so is fayrest shall to earth returne. 
But that same lofty countenance seemes to scorne 
Base thing, and thinke how she to heaven may clime: 
Treading downe earth as lothsome and forlorne, 
That hinders heavenly thoughts with drossy slime. 
Yet lowly still vouchsafe to looke on me, 
Such lowlinesse shall make you lofty be.





Astrophil and Stella 2: "Not at first sight, nor with a dribbd shot"
 

Not at first sight, nor with a dribbd shot, 
   Love gave the wound which while I breathe will bleed: 
   But known worth did in mine of time proceed, 
Till by degrees it had full conquest got. 
I saw, and liked; I liked, but lovd not; 
   I loved, but straight did not what love decreed: 
   At length to love's decrees I, forced, agreed, 
Yet with repining at so partial lot. 
   Now even that footstep of lost liberty 
Is gone, and now like slave-born Muscovite 
I call it praise to suffer tyranny; 
And now employ the remnant of my wit 
   To make myself believe that all is well, 
   While with a feeling skill I paint my hell.





Astrophil and Stella 5: "It is most true, that eyes are formed to serve"
 

It is most true, that eyes are formed to serve 
The inward light; and that the heavenly part 
Ought to be king, from whose rules who do swerve, 
Rebels to Nature, strive for their own smart. 
    It is most true, what we call Cupid's dart, 
An image is, which for ourselves we carve; 
And, fools, adore in temple of our heart, 
Till that good god make Church and churchman starve. 
    True, that true beauty virtue is indeed, 
Whereof this beauty can be but a shade, 
Which elements with mortal mixture breed; 
True, that on earth we are but pilgrims made, 
    And should in soul up to our country move; 
True; and yet true, that I must Stella love.





Astrophil and Stella 101: "Stella is sick, and in that sick-bed lies"
 

Stella is sick, and in that sick-bed lies 
Sweetness, that breathes and pants as oft as she; 
And grace, sick too, such fine conclusions tries 
That sickness brags itself best graced to be. 
    Beauty is sick, but sick in so fair guise 
That in that paleness beauty's white we see; 
And joy, which is inseparate from these eyes, 
Stella now learns (strange case!) to weep in thee. 
   Love moves thy pain, and like a faithful page, 
As thy looks stir, runs up and down, to make 
All folks prest at thy will thy pain to assuage; 
Nature with care sweats for her darling's sake, 
   Knowing worlds pass, ere she enough can find 
   Of such heaven stuff, to clothe so heavenly mind.





Astrophil and Stella 102: "Where be the roses gone, which sweetened so our eyes?"
 

Where be the roses gone, which sweetened so our eyes? 
    Where those red cheeks, which oft with fair increase did frame 
    The height of honor in the kindly badge of shame? 
Who hath the crimson weeds stolen from my morning skies? 
How doth the color vade of those vermilion dyes, 
    Which Nature's self did make, and self engrained the same! 
    I would know by what right this paleness overcame 
That hue, whose force my heart still unto thraldom ties? 
    Galen's adoptive sons, who by a beaten way 
    Their judgements hackney on, the fault on sickness lay; 
But feeling proof makes me say they mistake it far: 
    It is but love, which makes his paper perfect white 
    To write therein more fresh the story of delight, 
Whiles beauty's reddest ink Venus for him doth stir.





Astrophil and Stella 106: "O absent presence, Stella is not here"
 

O absent presence, Stella is not here; 
    False flattering hope, that with so fair a face 
    Bare me in hand, that in this orphan place 
Stella, I say my Stella, should appear. 
What say'st thou now? Where is that dainty cheer 
    Thou told'st mine eyes should help their famished case? 
    But thou art gone, now that self-felt disgrace 
Doth make me most to wish thy comfort near. 
    But here I do store of fair ladies meet, 
    Who may with charm of conversation sweet 
Make in my heavy mould new thoughts to grow: 
    Sure they prevail as much with me, as he 
    That bade his friend, but then new maimed, to be 
Merry with him, and not think of his woe.





Delia 1:Unto the boundless Ocean of thy beauty
 

Unto the boundless Ocean of thy beauty 
Runs this poor river, charged with streams of zeal: 
Returning thee the tribute of my duty, 
Which here my love, my youth, my plaints reveal. 
Here I unclasp the book of my charged soul, 
Where I have cast th'accounts of all my care: 
Here have I summed my sighs, here I enroll 
How they were spent for thee; look what they are. 
Look on the dear expenses of my youth, 
And see how just I reckon with thine eyes: 
Examine well thy beauty with my truth, 
And cross my cares ere greater sum arise. 
Read it sweet maid, though it be done but slightly; 
Who can show all his love, doth love but lightly.





Delia 36:But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again
 

But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again, 
Now whilst thy May hath filled thy lap with flowers, 
Now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain, 
Now use the summer smiles, ere winter lowers. 
And whilst thou spread'st unto the rising sun 
The fairest flower that ever saw the light, 
Now joy thy time before thy sweet be done, 
And, Delia, think thy morning must have night, 
And that thy brightness sets at length to west, 
When thou wilt close up that which now thou shew'st; 
And think the same becomes thy fading best 
Which then shall most inveil and shadow most. 
Men do not weigh the stalk for what it was, 
When once they find her flower, her glory, pass.





Sonnet  2: When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
 

When forty winters shall besiege thy brow 
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, 
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now, 
Will be a tattered weed, of small worth held. 
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies-- 
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days-- 
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes 
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise. 
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use 
If thou couldst answer "This fair child of mine 
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse", 
Proving his beauty by succession thine. 
    This were to be new made when thou art old, 
    And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.





Sonnet 12: When I do count the clock that tells the time
 

When I do count the clock that tells the time, 
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night; 
When I behold the violet past prime, 
And sable curls ensilvered o'er with white; 
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves, 
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd, 
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves 
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard: 
Then of thy beauty do I question make 
That thou among the wastes of time must go, 
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake, 
And die as fast as they see others grow; 
And nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence 
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence.





Sonnet 20: A womans face with natures own hand painted
 

A woman's face with nature's own hand painted 
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion; 
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted 
With shifting change as is false women's fashion; 
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling, 
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth; 
A man in hue, all hues in his controlling, 
Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth. 
And for a woman wert thou first created, 
Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting, 
And by addition me of thee defeated 
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing. 
      But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure, 
      Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.





Sonnet 40: Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all
 

Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all: 
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before? 
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call-- 
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more. 
Then if for my love thou my love receivest, 
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest; 
But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest 
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest. 
I do forgive thy robb'ry, gentle thief, 
Although thou steal thee all my poverty; 
And yet love knows it is a greater grief 
To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury. 
    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, 
    Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.





Song:"When that I was and a little tiny boy (With hey, ho, the wind and the rain)
 

(from Twelfth Night)
When that I was and a little tiny boy, 
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
A foolish thing was but a toy, 
    For the rain it raineth every day. 

But when I came to man's estate, 
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate, 
    For the rain it raineth every day. 

But when I came, alas! to wive, 
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
By swaggering could I never thrive, 
    For the rain it raineth every day. 

But when I came unto my beds, 
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
With toss-pots still had drunken heads, 
    For the rain it raineth every day. 

A great while ago the world begun, 
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, 
But that's all one, our play is done, 
    And we'll strive to please you every day.





Song: "Fear no more the heat o the sun
 

(from Cymbeline)
Fear no more the heat o' the sun, 
Nor the furious winter's rages; 
Thou thy worldly task hast done, 
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages: 
Golden lads and girls all must, 
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust. 

Fear no more the frown o' the great; 
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke; 
Care no more to clothe and eat; 
To thee the reed is as the oak: 
The scepter, learning, physic, must 
All follow this, and come to dust. 

Fear no more the lightning flash, 
Nor the all-dreaded thunder stone; 
Fear not slander, censure rash; 
Thou hast finished joy and moan: 
All lovers young, all lovers must 
Consign to thee, and come to dust. 

No exorciser harm thee! 
Nor no witchcraft charm thee! 
Ghost unlaid forbear thee! 
Nothing ill come near thee! 
Quiet consummation have; 
And renownd be thy grave!





Amoretti LXII:  "The weary yeare his race now having run"
 

The weary yeare his race now having run, 
The new begins his compast course anew: 
With shew of morning mylde he hath begun, 
Betokening peace and plenty to ensew.
So let us, which this chaunge of weather vew, 
Chaunge eeke our mynds and former lives amend,
The old yeares sinnes forepast let us eschew, 
And fly the faults with which we did offend. 
Then shall the new yeares joy forth freshly send, 
Into the glooming world his gladsome ray: 
And all these stormes which now his beauty blend, 
Shall turne to caulmes and tymely cleare away. 
So likewise love cheare you your heavy spright, 
And chaunge old yeares annoy to new delight.





Amoretti LXVI:  "To all those happy blessings which ye have"
 

To all those happy blessings which ye have, 
With plenteous hand by heaven upon you thrown: 
This one disparagement they to you gave, 
That ye your love lent to so meane a one. 
Yee whose high worths surpassing paragon, 
Could not on earth have found one fit for mate, 
Ne but in heaven matchable to none, 
Why did ye stoup unto so lowly state. 
But ye thereby much greater glory gate, 
Then had ye sorted with a princes pere: 
For now your light doth more it selfe dilate, 
And in my darknesse greater doth appeare. 
Yet since your light hath once enlumind me, 
With my reflex yours shall encreased be.





Regeneration
 

A ward, and still in bonds, one day
         I stole abroad;
It was high spring, and all the way
    Primrosed and hung with shade;
    Yet was it frost within,
         And surly winds
Blasted my infant buds, and sin
    Like clouds eclipsed my mind.

Stormed thus, I straight perceived my spring
         Mere stage and show,
My walk a monstrous, mountained thing,
    Roughcast with rocks and snow;
    And as a pilgrim's eye,
         Far from relief,
Measures the melancholy sky,
    Then drops and rains for grief,

So sighed I upwards still; at last
         'Twixt steps and falls
I reached the pinnacle, where placed
    I found a pair of scales;
    I took them up and laid
         In th' one, late pains;
The other smoke and pleasures weighed,
    But proved the heavier grains.

With that some cried, Away! Straight I
         Obeyed, and led
Full east, a fair, fresh field could spy;
    Some called it Jacob's bed,
    A virgin soil which no
         Rude feet ere trod,
Where, since he stepped there, only go
    Prophets and friends of God.

Here I reposed; but scarce well set,
         A grove descried
Of stately height, whose branches met
    And mixed on every side;
    I entered, and once in,
         Amazed to see 't,
Found all was changed, and a new spring
    Did all my senses greet.

The unthrift sun shot vital gold,
         A thousand pieces,
And heaven its azure did unfold,
    Checkered with snowy fleeces;
    The air was all in spice,
         And every bush
A garland wore; thus fed my eyes,
    But all the ear lay hush.

Only a little fountain lent
         Some use for ears,
And on the dumb shades language spent
    The music of her tears;
    I drew her near, and found
         The cistern full
Of divers stones, some bright and round,
    Others ill-shaped and dull.

The first, pray mark, as quick as light
         Danced through the flood,
But the last, more heavy than the night,
    Nailed to the center stood;
    I wondered much, but tired
         At last with thought,
My restless eye that still desired
    As strange an object brought.

It was a bank of flowers, where I descried
         Though 'twas midday,
Some fast asleep, others broad-eyed
    And taking in the ray;
    Here, musing long, I heard
         A rushing wind
Which still increased, but whence it stirred
    No where I could not find.

I turned me round, and to each shade
         Dispatched an eye
To see if any leaf had made 
    Least motion or reply,
    But while I listening sought
         My mind to ease
By knowing where 'twas, or where not,
    It whispered, Where I please.

Lord, then said I, on me one breath,
And let me die before my death!


             Cant. chap. 5. ver. 17

Arise O North, and come thou South-wind and blow upon my garden, that
 the spices thereof may flow out.





The Night
 

                   John 3.2 

      Through that pure virgin shrine,
That sacred veil drawn o'er Thy glorious noon,
That men might look and live, as glowworms shine,
         And face the moon,
    Wise Nicodemus saw such light
    As made him know his God by night.

      Most blest believer he!
Who in that land of darkness and blind eyes
Thy long-expected healing wings could see,
         When Thou didst rise! 
    And, what can never more be done,
    Did at midnight speak with the Sun!

      O who will tell me where
He found Thee at that dead and silent hour?
What hallowed solitary ground did bear
         So rare a flower,
    Within whose sacred leaves did lie
    The fulness of the Deity?

      No mercy-seat of gold,
No dead and dusty cherub, nor carved stone,
But His own living works did my Lord hold
         And lodge alone;
    Where trees and herbs did watch and peep
    And wonder, while the Jews did sleep.

      Dear night! this world's defeat;
The stop to busy fools; care's check and curb;
The day of spirits; my soul's calm retreat
         Which none disturb!
    Christ's progress, and His prayer time;
    The hours to which high heaven doth chime;

      God's silent, searching flight;
When my Lord's head is filled with dew, and all
His locks are wet with the clear drops of night;
         His still, soft call;
    His knocking time; the soul's dumb watch,
    When spirits their fair kindred catch.

      Were all my loud, evil days
Calm and unhaunted as is thy dark tent,
Whose peace but by some angel's wing or voice
         Is seldom rent,
    Then I in heaven all the long year
    Would keep, and never wander here.

      But living where the sun
Doth all things wake, and where all mix and tire
Themselves and others, I consent and run
         To every mire,
    And by this world's ill-guiding light,
    Err more than I can do by night.

      There is in God, some say,
A deep but dazzling darkness, as men here
Say it is late and dusky, because they
         See not all clear.
    O for that night! where I in Him
    Might live invisible and dim!





Song from The Indian Emperor
 

Ah, fading joy, how quickly art thou past! 
      Yet we thy ruin haste. 
As if the cares of human life were few, 
      We seek out new: 
And follow fate, which would too fast pursue. 
See how on every bough the birds express 
      In their sweet notes their happiness. 
      They all enjoy and nothing spare; 
But on their mother nature lay their care. 
Why then should man, the lord of all below, 
      Such troubles choose to know 
As none of all his subjects undergo? 

Hark, hark, the waters fall, fall, fall, 
      And with a murmuring sound 
      Dash, dash upon the ground, 
         To gentle slumbers call.





To Mr. Henry Lawes
 

Nature, which is the vast creation's soul, 
That steady curious agent in the whole, 
The art of Heaven, the order of this frame, 
Is only number in another name. 
For as some king conqu'ring what was his own, 
Hath choice of several titles to his crown; 
So harmony on this score now, that then, 
Yet still is all that takes and governs men. 
Beauty is but composure, and we find 
Content is but the concord of the mind, 
Friendship the unison of well-turned hearts, 
Honor the chorus of the noblest parts, 
And all the world on which we can reflect 
Music to th'ear, or to the intellect. 
If then each man a little world must be, 
How many worlds are copied out in thee, 
Who art so richly formed, so complete 
T'epitomize all that is good and great; 
Whose stars this brave advantage did impart, 
Thy nature's as harmonious as thy art? 
Thou dost above the poets' praises live, 
Who fetch from thee th'eternity they give. 
And as true reason triumphs over sense, 
Yet is subjected to intelligence: 
So poets on the lower world look down, 
But Lawes on them; his height is all his own. 
For, like Divinity it self, his lyre 
Rewards the wit it did at first inspire. 
And thus by double right poets allow   
His and their laurel should adorn his brow. 
Live then, great soul of nature, to assuage 
The savage dulness of this sullen age. 
Charm us to sense; for though experience fail 
And reason too, thy numbers may prevail. 
Then, like those ancients, strike, and so command 
All nature to obey thy gen'rous hand. 
None will resist but such who needs will be 
More stupid than a stone, a fish, a tree. 
Be it thy care our age to new-create: 
What built a world may sure repair a state.





On the Welsh Language
 

If honor to an ancient name be due, 
Or riches challenge it for one that's new, 
The British language claims in either sense 
Both for its age, and for its opulence. 
But all great things must be from us removed, 
To be with higher reverence beloved. 
So landskips which in prospects distant lie, 
With greater wonder draw the pleasd eye. 
Is not great Troy to one dark ruin hurled? 
Once the fam'd scene of all fighting world. 
Where's Athens now, to whom Rome learning owes, 
And the safe laurels that adorned her brows? 
A strange reverse of fate she did endure, 
Never once greater, than she's now obscure. 
Even Rome her self can but some footsteps show 
Of Scipio's times, or those of Cicero. 
And as the Roman and the Grecian state, 
The British fell, the spoil of time and fate. 
But though the language hath the beauty lost, 
Yet she has still some great remains to boast. 
For 'twas in that, the sacred bards of old, 
In deathless numbers did their thoughts unfold. 
In groves, by rivers, and on fertile plains, 
They civilized and taught the listening swains; 
Whilst with high raptures, and as great success, 
Virtue they clothed in music's charming dress. 
This Merlin spoke, who in his gloomy cave, 
Even Destiny her self seemed to enslave. 
For to his sight the future time was known, 
Much better than to others is their own; 
And with such state, predictions from him fell, 
As if he did decree, and not foretell. 
This spoke King Arthur, who, if fame be true, 
Could have compelled mankind to speak it too. 
In this once Boadicca valor taught, 
And spoke more nobly than her soldiers fought: 
Tell me what hero could be more than she, 
Who fell at once for fame and liberty? 
Nor could a greater sacrifice belong, 
Or to her children's, or her country's wrong. 
This spoke Caractacus, who was so brave, 
That to the Roman fortune check he gave: 
And when their yoke he could decline no more, 
He it so decently and nobly wore, 
That Rome her self with blushes did believe, 
A Britain would the law of honor give; 
And hastily his chains away she threw, 
Lest her own captive else should her subdue.





To My Excellent Lucasia, on Our Friendship
 

I did not live until this time 
    Crowned my felicity, 
When I could say without a crime, 
    I am not thine, but thee. 

This carcass breathed, and walked, and slept, 
    So that the world believed   
There was a soul the motions kept; 
    But they were all deceived. 

For as a watch by art is wound 
    To motion, such was mine: 
But never had Orinda found 
    A soul till she found thine; 

Which now inspires, cures and supplies, 
    And guides my darkened breast: 
For thou art all that I can prize, 
    My joy, my life, my rest. 

No bridegroom's nor crown-conqueror's mirth 
    To mine compared can be: 
They have but pieces of the earth, 
    I've all the world in thee. 

Then let our flames still light and shine, 
    And no false fear control, 
As innocent as our design, 
    Immortal as our soul.





The Salutation
 

These little limbs, 
    These eyes and hands which here I find, 
These rosy cheeks wherewith my life begins, 
    Where have ye been? behind 
What curtain were ye from me hid so long? 
Where was, in what abyss, my speaking tongue? 

         When silent I   
    So many thousand, thousand years 
Beneath the dust did in a chaos lie, 
    How could I smiles or tears, 
Or lips or hands or eyes or ears perceive? 
Welcome ye treasures which I now receive. 

         I that so long 
    Was nothing from eternity, 
Did little think such joys as ear or tongue 
    To celebrate or see: 
Such sounds to hear, such hands to feel, such feet, 
Beneath the skies on such a ground to meet. 

         New burnished joys, 
    Which yellow gold and pearls excel! 
Such sacred treasures are the limbs in boys, 
    In which a soul doth dwell; 
Their organizd joints and azure veins 
More wealth include than all the world contains. 

         From dust I rise, 
    And out of nothing now awake; 
These brighter regions which salute mine eyes, 
    A gift from God I take. 
The earth, the seas, the light, the day, the skies, 
The sun and stars are mine if those I prize. 

         Long time before 
    I in my mother's womb was born, 
A God, preparing, did this glorious store, 
    The world, for me adorn. 
Into this Eden so divine and fair, 
So wide and bright, I come His son and heir. 

         A stranger here 
    Strange things doth meet, strange glories see; 
Strange treasures lodged in this fair world appear, 
    Strange all and new to me; 
But that they mine should be, who nothing was, 
That strangest is of all, yet brought to pass.





To the Same Purpose
 

To the same purpose: he, not long before
    Brought home from nurse, going to the door
         To do some little thing
         He must not do within,
                With wonder cries,
                As in the skies
He saw the moon, O yonder is the moon,
    Newly come after me to town,
That shined at Lugwardin but yesternight,
    Where I enjoyed the self-same sight.

As if it had ev'n twenty thousand faces,
    It shines at once in many places;
         To all the earth so wide
         God doth the stars divide,
                With so much art
                The moon impart,
They serve us all; serve wholly every one
    As if they servd him alone.
While every single person hath such store,
    'Tis want of sense that makes us poor.





Shadows in the Water
 

In unexperienced infancy 
Many a sweet mistake doth lie: 
Mistake though false, intending true; 
A seeming somewhat more than view; 
         That doth instruct the mind 
         In things that lie behind, 
And many secrets to us show 
Which afterwards we come to know. 

Thus did I by the water's brink 
Another world beneath me think; 
And while the lofty spacious skies 
Reversd there, abused mine eyes, 
         I fancied other feet 
         Came mine to touch or meet; 
As by some puddle I did play 
Another world within it lay. 

Beneath the water people drowned, 
Yet with another heaven crowned, 
In spacious regions seemed to go 
As freely moving to and fro: 
         In bright and open space 
         I saw their very face; 
Eyes, hands, and feet they had like mine; 
Another sun did with them shine. 

'Twas strange that people there should walk, 
And yet I could not hear them talk; 
That through a little watery chink, 
Which one dry ox or horse might drink, 
         We other worlds should see, 
         Yet not admitted be; 
And other confines there behold 
Of light and darkness, heat and cold. 

I called them oft, but called in vain; 
No speeches we could entertain: 
Yet did I there expect to find 
Some other world, to please my mind. 
         I plainly saw by these 
         A new antipodes, 
Whom, though they were so plainly seen, 
A film kept off that stood between. 

By walking men's reversd feet 
I chanced another world to meet; 
Though it did not to view exceed 
A phantom, 'tis a world indeed, 
         Where skies beneath us shine, 
         And earth by art divine 
Another face presents below, 
Where people's feet against ours go. 

Within the regions of the air, 
Compassed about with heavens fair, 
Great tracts of land there may be found 
Enriched with fields and fertile ground; 
         Where many numerous hosts 
         In those far distant coasts, 
For other great and glorious ends 
Inhabit, my yet unknown friends. 

O ye that stand upon the brink, 
Whom I so near me through the chink 
With wonder see: what faces there, 
Whose feet, whose bodies, do ye wear? 
         I my companions see 
         In you, another me. 
They seemd others, but are we; 
Our second selves these shadows be. 

Look how far off those lower skies 
Extend themselves! scarce with mine eyes 
I can them reach. O ye my friends, 
What secret borders on those ends? 
         Are lofty heavens hurled 
'Bout your inferior world? 
Are yet the representatives 
Of other peoples' distant lives? 

Of all the playmates which I knew 
That here I do the image view 
In other selves, what can it mean? 
But that below the purling stream 
         Some unknown joys there be 
         Laid up in store for me; 
To which I shall, when that thin skin 
Is broken, be admitted in.





On the Death of the Late Earl of Rochester
 

Mourn, mourn, ye Muses, all your loss deplore, 
The young, the noble Strephon is no more. 
Yes, yes, he fled quick as departing light, 
And ne'er shall rise from Death's eternal night, 
So rich a prize the Stygian gods ne'er bore, 
Such wit, such beauty, never graced their shore. 
He was but lent this duller world t' improve 
In all the charms of poetry, and love; 
Both were his gift, which freely he bestowed, 
And like a god, dealt to the wond'ring crowd. 
Scorning the little vanity of fame, 
Spight of himself attained a glorious name. 
But oh! in vain was all his peevish pride, 
The sun as soon might his vast luster hide, 
As piercing, pointed, and more lasting bright, 
As suffering no vicissitudes of night. 
   Mourn, mourn, ye Muses, all your loss deplore, 
   The young, the noble Strephon is no more. 
Now uninspired upon your banks we lie, 
Unless when we would mourn his elegy; 
His name's a genius that would wit dispense, 
And give the theme a soul, the words a sense. 
But all fine thought that ravisht when it spoke, 
With the soft youth eternal leave has took; 
Uncommon wit that did the soul o'ercome, 
Is buried all in Strephon's worshipped tomb; 
Satire has lost its art, its sting is gone, 
The Fop and Cully now may be undone; 
That dear instructing rage is now allayed, 
And no sharp pen dares tell 'em how they've strayed; 
Bold as a god was ev'ry lash he took, 
But kind and gentle the chastizing stroke. 
    Mourn, mourn, ye youths, whom fortune has betrayed, 
    The last reproacher of your vice is dead. 
Mourn, all ye beauties, put your Cyprus on, 
The truest swain that e're adored you's gone; 
Think how he loved, and writ, and sighed, and spoke, 
Recall his mien, his fashion, and his look. 
By what dear arts the soul he did surprise, 
Soft as his voice, and charming as his eyes. 
Bring garlands all of never-dying flowers, 
Bedewed with everlasting falling showers; 
Fix your fair eyes upon your victimed slave, 
Sent gay and young to his untimely grave. 
See where the noble swain extended lies, 
Too sad a triumph of your victories; 
Adorned with all the graces Heaven e'er lent, 
All that was great, soft, lovely, excellent 
You've laid into his early monument. 
    Mourn, mourn, ye beauties, your sad loss deplore, 
    The young, the charming Strephon is no more. 

Mourn, all ye little gods of love, whose darts 
Have lost their wonted power of piercing hearts; 
Lay by the gilded quiver and the bow, 
The useless toys can do no mischief now, 
Those eyes that all your arrows' points inspired, 
Those lights that gave ye fire are now retired, 
Cold as his tomb, pale as your mother's doves; 
Bewail him then oh all ye little loves, 
For you the humblest votary have lost 
That ever your divinities could boast; 
Upon your hands your weeping heads decline, 
And let your wings encompass round his shrine; 
In stead of flowers your broken arrows strow, 
And at his feet lay the neglected bow. 
         Mourn, all ye little gods, your loss deplore, 
         The soft, the charming Strephon is no more. 

Large was his fame, but short his glorious race, 
Like young Lucretius lived and died apace. 
So early roses fade, so over all 
They cast their fragrant scents, then softly fall, 
While all the scattered perfumed leaves declare, 
How lovely 'twas when whole, how sweet, how fair. 
Had he been to the Roman Empire known, 
When great Augustus filled the peaceful throne; 
Had he the noble wond'rous poet seen, 
And known his genius, and surveyed his mien, 
(When wits, and heroes graced divine abodes), 
He had increased the number of their gods; 
The royal judge had temples rear'd to's name, 
And made him as immortal as his fame; 
In love and verse his Ovid he'ad out-done, 
And all his laurels, and his Julia won. 
    Mourn, mourn, unhappy world, his loss deplore, 
    The great, the charming Strephon is no more.





A Thousand Martyrs
 

A thousand martyrs I have made, 
   All sacrificed to my desire; 
A thousand beauties have betrayed, 
   That languish in resistless fire. 
The untamed heart to hand I brought, 
And fixed the wild and wandering thought. 

I never vowed nor sighed in vain 
   But both, though false, were well received. 
The fair are pleased to give us pain, 
   And what they wish is soon believed. 
And though I talked of wounds and smart, 
Love's pleasures only touched my heart. 

Alone the glory and the spoil 
   I always laughing bore away; 
The triumphs, without pain or toil, 
   Without the hell, the heav'n of joy. 
And while I thus at random rove 
Despise the fools that whine for love.





The Disabled Debauchee
 

As some brave admiral, in former war 
   Deprived of force, but pressed with courage still, 
Two rival fleets appearing from afar, 
   Crawls to the top of an adjacent hill; 

From whence, with thoughts full of concern, he views 
   The wise and daring conduct of the fight, 
Whilst each bold action to his mind renews 
   His present glory and his past delight; 

From his fierce eyes flashes of fire he throws, 
   As from black clouds when lightning breaks away; 
Transported, thinks himself amidst the foes, 
   And absent, yet enjoys the bloody day; 

So, when my days of impotence approach, 
   And I'm by pox and wine's unlucky chance 
Forced from the pleasing billows of debauch 
   On the dull shore of lazy temperance, 

My pains at least some respite shall afford 
   While I behold the battles you maintain 
When fleets of glasses sail about the board, 
   From whose broadsides volleys of wit shall rain. 

Nor let the sight of honorable scars, 
   Which my too forward valor did procure, 
Frighten new-listed soldiers from the wars: 
   Past joys have more than paid what I endure. 

Should any youth (worth being drunk) prove nice, 
   And from his fair inviter meanly shrink, 
'Twill please the ghost of my departed vice 
   If, at my counsel, he repent and drink. 

Or should some cold-complexioned sot forbid, 
   With his dull morals, our bold night-alarms, 
I'll fire his blood by telling what I did 
   When I was strong and able to bear arms. 

I'll tell of whores attacked, their lords at home; 
   Bawds' quarters beaten up, and fortress won; 
Windows demolished, watches overcome; 
   And handsome ills by my contrivance done. 

Nor shall our love-fits, Chloris, be forgot, 
   When each the well-looked linkboy strove t' enjoy, 
And the best kiss was the deciding lot 
   Whether the boy fucked you, or I the boy. 

With tales like these I will such thoughts inspire 
   As to important mischief shall incline: 
I'll make him long some ancient church to fire, 
   And fear no lewdness he's called to by wine. 

Thus, statesmanlike, I'll saucily impose, 
   And safe from action, valiantly advise; 
Sheltered in impotence, urge you to blows, 
   And being good for nothing else, be wise.





The Imperfect Enjoyment
 

Naked she lay, clasped in my longing arms, 
I filled with love, and she all over charms; 
Both equally inspired with eager fire, 
Melting through kindness, flaming in desire. 
With arms, legs, lips close clinging to embrace, 
She clips me to her breast, and sucks me to her face. 
Her nimble tongue, love's lesser lightning, played 
Within my mouth, and to my thoughts conveyed 
Swift orders that I should prepare to throw 
The all-dissolving thunderbolt below. 
My fluttering soul, sprung with the pointed kiss, 
Hangs hovering o'er her balmy brinks of bliss. 
But whilst her busy hand would guide that part 
Which should convey my soul up to her heart, 
In liquid raptures I dissolve all o'er, 
Melt into sperm, and spend at every pore. 
A touch from any part of her had done 't: 
Her hand, her foot, her very look's a cunt.
    Smiling, she chides in a kind murmuring noise, 
And from her body wipes the clammy joys, 
When, with a thousand kisses wandering o'er 
My panting bosom, "Is there then no more? 
She cries. "All this to love and rapture's due; 
Must we not pay a debt to pleasure too? 
    But I, the most forlorn, lost man alive, 
To show my wished obedience vainly strive: 
I sigh, alas! and kiss, but cannot swive. 
Eager desires confound my first intent, 
Succeeding shame does more success prevent, 
And rage at last confirms me impotent. 
Ev'n her fair hand, which might bid heat return 
To frozen age, and make cold hermits burn, 
Applied to my dear cinder, warms no more 
Than fire to ashes could past flames restore. 
Trembling, confused, despairing, limber, dry, 
A wishing, weak, unmoving lump I lie. 
This dart of love, whose piercing point, oft tried, 
With virgin blood ten thousand maids has dyed, 
Which nature still directed with such art 
That it through every cunt reached every heart-- 
Stiffly resolved, 'twould carelessly invade 
Woman or man, nor ought its fury stayed: 
Where'er it pierced, a cunt it found or made-- 
Now languid lies in this unhappy hour, 
Shrunk up and sapless like a withered flower. 
    Thou treacherous, base deserter of my flame, 
False to my passion, fatal to my fame, 
Through what mistaken magic dost thou prove 
So true to lewdness, so untrue to love? 
What oyster-cinder-beggar-common whore 
Didst thou e'er fail in all thy life before? 
When vice, disease, and scandal lead the way, 
With what officious haste doest thou obey! 
Like a rude, roaring hector in the streets 
Who scuffles, cuffs, and justles all he meets, 
But if his king or country claim his aid, 
The rakehell villain shrinks and hides his head; 
Ev'n so thy brutal valor is displayed, 
Breaks every stew, does each small whore invade, 
But when great Love the onset does command, 
Base recreant to thy prince, thou dar'st not stand. 
Worst part of me, and henceforth hated most, 
Through all the town a common fucking post, 
On whom each whore relieves her tingling cunt 
As hogs on gates do rub themselves and grunt, 
Mayst thou to ravenous chancres be a prey, 
Or in consuming weepings waste away; 
May strangury and stone thy days attend; 
May'st thou never piss, who didst refuse to spend 
When all my joys did on false thee depend. 
   And may ten thousand abler pricks agree 
   To do the wronged Corinna right for thee.





The Mock Song
 

I swive as well as others do, 
I'm young, not yet deformed, 
My tender heart, sincere, and true, 
Deserves not to be scorned. 

Why Phyllis then, why will you swive, 
With forty lovers more? 
Can I (said she) with Nature strive, 
Alas I am, alas I am a whore. 

Were all my body larded o'er, 
With darts of love, so thick, 
That you might find in ev'ry pore, 
A well stuck standing prick; 

Whilst yet my eyes alone were free, 
My heart, would never doubt, 
In am'rous rage, and ecstasy, 
To wish those eyes, to wish those eyes fucked out.





A Song of a Young Lady to Her Ancient Lover
 

Ancient person, for whom I
All the flattering youth defy,
Long be it ere thou grow old,
Aching, shaking, crazy, cold;
   But still continue as thou art,
   Ancient person of my heart.

On thy withered lips and dry,
Which like barren furrows lie,
Brooding kisses I will pour
Shall thy youthful [heat] restore
(Such kind showers in autumn fall,
And a second spring recall);
   Nor from thee will ever part,
   Ancient person of my heart.

Thy nobler part, which but to name
In our sex would be counted shame,
By age's frozen grasp possessed,
From [his] ice shall be released,
And soothed by my reviving hand,
In former warmth and vigor stand.
All a lover's wish can reach
For thy joy my love shall teach,
And for they pleasure shall improve
All that art can add to love.
   Yet still I love thee without art,
   Ancient person of my heart.





"Once there came a man"
 

Once there came a man 
Who said:   
"Range me all men of the world in rows. 
And instantly   
There was a terrific clamor among the people 
Against being ranged in rows. 
There was a loud quarrel, world-wide. 
It endured for ages; 
And blood was shed 
By those who would not stand in rows, 
And by those who pined to stand in rows. 
Eventually, the man went to death, weeping. 
And those who stayed in the bloody scuffle 
Knew not the great simplicity. 






"Behold, the grave of a wicked man"
 

Behold, the grave of a wicked man,

And near it, a stern spirit.

There came a drooping maid with violets, 

But the spirit grasped her arm.

No flowers for him, he said.

The maid wept: 

Ah, I loved him.

But the spirit, grim and frowning: 

No flowers for him. 


Now, this is it --

If the spirit was just,

Why did the maid weep?







"I saw a man pursuing the horizon"
 

I saw a man pursuing the horizon; 
Round and round they sped. 
I was disturbed at this;   
I accosted the man. 
"It is futile, I said, 
"You can never -- 

"You lie, he cried,   
And ran on. 






Venus of the Louvre
 

Down the long hall she glistens like a star,
The foam-born mother of Love, transfixed to stone,
Yet none the less immortal, breathing on.
Time's brutal hand hath maimed but could not mar.
When first the enthralled enchantress from afar
Dazzled mine eyes, I saw not her alone,
Serenely poised on her world-worshipped throne,
As when she guided once her dove-drawn car,--
But at her feet a pale, death-stricken Jew,
Her life adorer, sobbed farewell to love.
Here Heine wept! Here still he weeps anew,
Nor ever shall his shadow lift or move,
While mourns one ardent heart, one poet-brain,
For vanished Hellas and Hebraic pain.






After the Pleasure Party:  Lines Traced Under an Image of Amor Threatening
 

Fear me, virgin whosoever 
Taking pride from love exempt, 
Fear me, slighted. Never, never 
Brave me, nor my fury tempt: 
Downy wings, but wroth they beat 
Tempest even in reason's seat. 


   Behind the house the upland falls 
With many an odorous tree-- 
White marbles gleaming through green halls-- 
Terrace by terrace, down and down, 
And meets the star-lit Mediterranean Sea. 

   Tis Paradise. In such an hour 
Some pangs that rend might take release. 
Nor less perturbed who keeps this bower 
Of balm, nor finds balsamic peace? 
From whom the passionate words in vent 
After long revery's discontent? 

   "Tired of the homeless deep, 
Look how their flight yon hurrying billows urge, 
   Hitherward but to reap 
Passive repulse from the iron-bound verge! 
Insensate, can they never know 
'Tis mad to wreck the impulsion so? 

   "An art of memory is, they tell: 
But to forget! forget the glade 
Wherein Fate sprung Love's ambuscade, 
To flout pale years of cloistral life 
And flush me in this sensuous strife. 
'Tis Vesta struck with Sappho's smart. 
No fable her delirious leap: 
With more of cause in desperate heart, 
Myself could take it--but to sleep! 

   "Now first I feel, what all may ween, 
That soon or late, if faded e'en, 
One's sex asserts itself. Desire, 
The dear desire through love to sway, 
Is like the Geysers that aspire-- 
Through cold obstruction win their fervid way. 
But baffled here--to take disdain, 
To feel rule's instinct, yet not reign; 
To dote, to come to this drear shame-- 
Hence the winged blaze that sweeps my soul 
Like prairie-fires that spurn control, 
Where withering weeds incense the flame. 

   "And kept I long heaven's watch for this, 
Contemning love, for this, even this? 
O terrace chill in Northern air, 
O reaching ranging tube I placed 
Against yon skies, and fable chased 
Till, fool, I hailed for sister there 
Starred Cassiopea in Golden Chair. 
In dream I throned me, nor I saw 
In cell the idiot crowned with straw. 

   "And yet, ah yet, scarce ill I reigned, 
Through self-illusion self-sustained, 
When now--enlightened, undeceived-- 
What gain I, barrenly bereaved! 
Than this can be yet lower decline-- 
Envy and spleen, can these be mine? 

   "The peasant-girl demure that trod 
Beside our wheels that climbed the way, 
And bore along a blossoming rod 
That looked the sceptre of May-Day-- 
On her--to fire this petty hell, 
His softened glance how moistly fell! 
The cheat! on briers her buds were strung; 
And wiles peeped forth from mien how meek. 
The innocent bare-foot! young, so young! 
To girls, strong man's a novice weak. 
To tell such beads! And more remain, 
Sad rosary of belittling pain. 

   "When after lunch and sallies gay 
Like the Decameron folk we lay 
In sylvan groups; and I--let be! 
O, dreams he, can he dream that one 
Because not roseate feels no sun? 
The plain lone bramble thrills with Spring 
As much as vines that grapes shall bring. 

   "Me now fair studies charm no more. 
Shall great thoughts writ, or high themes sung 
Damask wan cheeks--unlock his arm 
About some radiant ninny flung? 
How glad with all my starry lore, 
I'd buy the veriest wanton's rose 
Would but my bee therein repose. 

   "Could I remake me! or set free 
This sexless bound in sex, then plunge 
Deeper than Sappho, in a lunge 
Piercing Pan's paramount mystery! 
For, Nature, in no shallow surge 
Against thee either sex may urge, 
Why hast thou made us but in halves-- 
Co-relatives? This makes us slaves. 
If these co-relatives never meet 
Self-hood itself seems incomplete. 
And such the dicing of blind fate 
Few matching halves here meet and mate. 
What Cosmic jest or Anarch blunder 
The human integral clove asunder 
And shied the fractions through life's gate? 

   "Ye stars that long your votary knew 
Rapt in her vigil, see me here! 
Whither is gone the spell ye threw 
When rose before me Cassiopea? 
Usurped on by love's stronger reign-- 
But, lo, your very selves do wane: 
Light breaks--truth breaks! Silvered no more, 
But chilled by dawn that brings the gale 
Shivers yon bramble above the vale, 
And disillusion opens all the shore. 

   One knows not if Urania yet 
The pleasure-party may forget; 
Or whether she lived down the strain 
Of turbulent heart and rebel brain; 
For Amor so resents a slight, 
And hers had been such haught disdain, 
He long may wreak his boyish spite, 
And boy-like, little reck the pain. 

   One knows not, no. But late in Rome 
(For queens discrowned a congruous home) 
Entering Albani's porch she stood 
Fixed by an antique pagan stone 
Colossal carved. No anchorite seer, 
Not Thomas a Kempis, monk austere, 
Religious more are in their tone; 
Yet far, how far from Christian heart 
That form august of heathen Art. 
Swayed by its influence, long she stood, 
Till surged emotion seething down, 
She rallied and this mood she won: 

   "Languid in frame for me, 
To-day by Mary's convent-shrine, 
Touched by her picture's moving plea 
In that poor nerveless hour of mine, 
I mused--A wanderer still must grieve. 
Half I resolved to kneel and believe, 
Believe and submit, the veil take on. 
But thee, arm'd Virgin! less benign, 
Thee now I invoke, thou mightier one. 
Helmeted woman--if such term 
Befit thee, far from strife 
Of that which makes the sexual feud 
And clogs the aspirant life-- 
O self-reliant, strong and free, 
Thou in whom power and peace unite, 
Transcender! raise me up to thee, 
Raise me and arm me! 

                         Fond appeal. 
For never passion peace shall bring, 
Nor Art inanimate for long 
Inspire. Nothing may help or heal 
While Amor incensed remembers wrong. 
Vindictive, not himself he'll spare; 
For scope to give his vengeance play 
Himself he'll blaspheme and betray. 

   Then for Urania, virgins everywhere, 
O pray! Example take too, and have care. 






To One in Paradise
 

Thou wast that all to me, love,
   For which my soul did pine--
A green isle in the sea, love,
   A fountain and a shrine,
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
   And all the flowers were mine.

Ah, dream too bright to last!
   Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
But to be overcast!
   A voice from out the Future cries,
On! on!--but o'er the Past
   (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
Mute, motionless, aghast!

For, alas! alas! with me
   The light of Life is o'er!
No more--no more--no more--
   (Such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore)
   Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
Or the stricken eagle soar!

And all my days are trances,
   And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy grey eye glances,
   And where thy footstep gleams--
In what ethereal dances,
   By what eternal streams.






The Bridge
 

I stood on the bridge at midnight, 
   As the clocks were striking the hour, 
And the moon rose o'er the city, 
   Behind the dark church-tower.   

I saw her bright reflection 
   In the waters under me, 
Like a golden goblet falling 
   And sinking into the sea.   

And far in the hazy distance 
   Of that lovely night in June, 
The blaze of the flaming furnace 
   Gleamed redder than the moon.   

Among the long, black rafters 
   The wavering shadows lay, 
And the current that came from the ocean 
   Seemed to lift and bear them away;   

As, sweeping and eddying through them, 
   Rose the belated tide, 
And, streaming into the moonlight, 
   The seaweed floated wide.   

And like those waters rushing 
   Among the wooden piers, 
A flood of thoughts came o'er me 
   That filled my eyes with tears.   

How often, O, how often, 
   In the days that had gone by, 
I had stood on that bridge at midnight 
   And gazed on that wave and sky!   

How often, O, how often, 
   I had wished that the ebbing tide 
Would bear me away on its bosom 
   O'er the ocean wild and wide!   

For my heart was hot and restless, 
   And my life was full of care, 
And the burden laid upon me 
   Seemed greater than I could bear.   

But now it has fallen from me, 
   It is buried in the sea; 
And only the sorrow of others 
   Throws its shadow over me.   

Yet whenever I cross the river 
   On its bridge with wooden piers, 
Like the odor of brine from the ocean 
   Comes the thought of other years.   

And I think how many thousands 
   Of care-encumbered men, 
Each bearing his burden of sorrow, 
   Have crossed the bridge since then.   

I see the long procession 
   Still passing to and fro, 
The young heart hot and restless, 
   And the old subdued and slow!   

And forever and forever, 
   As long as the river flows, 
As long as the heart has passions, 
   As long as life has woes;   

The moon and its broken reflection 
   And its shadows shall appear, 
As the symbol of love in heaven, 
   And its wavering image here. 






Give All to Love
 

Give all to love; 
Obey thy heart; 
Friends, kindred, days, 
Estate, good-frame, 
Plans, credit and the Muse,-- 
Nothing refuse. 

'T is a brave master; 
Let it have scope: 
Follow it utterly, 
Hope beyond hope: 
High and more high 
It dives into noon, 
With wing unspent, 
Untold intent: 
But it is a god, 
Knows its own path 
And the outlets of the sky. 

It was never for the mean; 
It requireth courage stout. 
Souls above doubt, 
Valor unbending, 
It will reward,-- 
They shall return 
More than they were, 
And ever ascending. 

Leave all for love; 
Yet, hear me, yet, 
One word more thy heart behoved, 
One pulse more of firm endeavor,-- 
Keep thee to-day, 
To-morrow, forever, 
Free as an Arab 
Of thy beloved. 

Cling with life to the maid; 
But when the surprise, 
First vague shadow of surmise 
Flits across her bosom young, 
Of a joy apart from thee, 
Free be she, fancy-free; 
Nor thou detain her vesture's hem, 
Nor the palest rose she flung 
From her summer diadem. 

Though thou loved her as thyself, 
As a self of purer clay, 
Though her parting dims the day, 
Stealing grace from all alive; 
Heartily know, 
When half-gods go,   
The gods arrive. 






Thanatopsis
 

     To him who in the love of Nature holds   
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks   
A various language; for his gayer hours   
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile   
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides   
Into his darker musings, with a mild   
And healing sympathy, that steals away   
Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts   
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight   
Over thy spirit, and sad images   
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,   
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,   
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;--   
Go forth, under the open sky, and list   
To Nature's teachings, while from all around-- 
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air-- 
Comes a still voice-- 
                                       Yet a few days, and thee   
The all-beholding sun shall see no more   
In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,   
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,   
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist   
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim   
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again, 
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up   
Thine individual being, shalt thou go   
To mix for ever with the elements,   
To be a brother to the insensible rock   
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain   
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak   
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.   
     Yet not to thine eternal resting-place   
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish   
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down   
With patriarchs of the infant world--with kings,   
The powerful of the earth--the wise, the good,   
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,   
All in one mighty sepulchre.   The hills   
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,--the vales   
Stretching in pensive quietness between;   
The venerable woods--rivers that move   
In majesty, and the complaining brooks   
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,   
Old Ocean's gray and melancholy waste,--   
Are but the solemn decorations all   
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,   
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,   
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,   
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread   
The globe are but a handful to the tribes   
That slumber in its bosom.--Take the wings   
Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,   
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods   
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,   
Save his own dashings--yet the dead are there:   
And millions in those solitudes, since first   
The flight of years began, have laid them down   
In their last sleep--the dead reign there alone. 
So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw   
In silence from the living, and no friend   
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe   
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh 
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care   
Plod on, and each one as before will chase   
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave   
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come 
And make their bed with thee. As the long train   
Of ages glide away, the sons of men,   
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes   
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,   
The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man--   
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,   
By those, who in their turn shall follow them.   
     So live, that when thy summons comes to join   
The innumerable caravan, which moves   
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take   
His chamber in the silent halls of death,   
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,   
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed   
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,   
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch   
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.





Before Parting
 

A month or twain to live on honeycomb 
   Is pleasant; but one tires of scented time, 
   Cold sweet recurrence of accepted rhyme, 
And that strong purple under juice and foam 
Where the wine's heart has burst; 
Nor feel the latter kisses like the first. 

Once yet, this poor one time; I will not pray 
   Even to change the bitterness of it,   
   The bitter taste ensuing on the sweet, 
To make your tears fall where your soft hair lay 
All blurred and heavy in some perfumed wise 
Over my face and eyes. 

And yet who knows what end the scythd wheat 
   Makes of its foolish poppies' mouths of red? 
   These were not sown, these are not harvested, 
They grow a month and are cast under feet   
And none has care thereof, 
As none has care of divided love. 

I know each shadow of your lips by rote, 
   Each change of love in eyelids and eyebrows; 
   The fashion of fair temples tremulous 
With tender blood, and colour of your throat; 
I know not how love is gone out of this, 
Seeing that all was his. 

Love's likeness there endures upon all these: 
   But out of these one shall not gather love. 
   Day hath not strength nor the night shade enough 
To make love whole and fill his lips with ease, 
As some bee-builded cell 
Feels at filled lips the heavy honey swell. 

I know not how this last month leaves your hair 
   Less full of purple colour and hid spice, 
   And that luxurious trouble of closed eyes 
Is mixed with meaner shadows and waste care; 
And love, kissed out by pleasure, seems not yet 
Worth patience to regret.   






The Expiration
 

So, so breake off this last lamenting kisse, 
    Which sucks two soules, and vapours Both away, 
Turne thou ghost that way, and let mee turne this, 
    And let our selves benight our happiest day, 
We ask'd none leave to love; nor will we owe 
    Any, so cheape a death, as saying, Goe; 

Goe; and if that word have not quite kil'd thee,   
    Ease mee with death, by bidding mee goe too. 
Oh, if it have, let my word worke on mee, 
    And a just office on a murderer doe. 
Except it be too late, to kill me so, 
    Being double dead, going, and bidding, goe.   






"Either she was foul, or her attire was bad"
 

Either she was foul, or her attire was bad,
Or she was not the wench I wished t'have had.
Idly I lay with her, as if I loved not,
And like a burden grieved the bed that moved not.
Yet though both of us performed our true intent,
Yet I could not cast anchor where I meant.
She on my neck her ivory arms did throw,
Her arms far whiter than the Scythian snow.
And eagerly she kissed me with her tongue,
And under mine her wanton thigh she flung.
Yea, and she soothed me up and called me sir,
And used all speech that might provoke and stir.
Yet, like as if cold hemlock I had drunk,
It mockd me, hung down the head, and sunk.
Like a dull cipher or rude block I lay,
Or shade or body was I, who can say?
What will my age do, age I cannot shun,
When in my prime my force is spent and done?
I blush, that being youthful, hot and lusty,
I prove neither youth nor man, but old and rusty.
Pure rose she, like a nun to sacrifice,
Or one that with her tender brother lies.
Yet boarded I the golden Chie twice,
And Libas, and the white-cheeked Pitho thrice.
Corinna craved it in a summer's night,
And nine sweet bouts we had before daylight.
What, waste my limbs through some Thessalian charms?
May spells and drugs do silly souls such harm?
With virgin wax hath some imbaste my joints
And pierced my liver with sharp needles' points?
Charms change corn to grass and make it die.
By charms are running spring and fountains dry.
By charms mast crops from oaks, from vines grapes fall,
And fruit from trees when there's no wind at all.
Why might not then my sinews be enchanted,
And I grow faint, as with some spirit haunted?
To this add shame: shame to perform it quailed me
And was the second cause why vigour failed me.
My idle thoughts delighted her no more
Than did the robe or garment which she wore.
Yet might her touch make youthful Pylius fire
And Tithon livelier than his years require.
Even her I had, and she had me in vain;
What might I crave more if I asked again?
I think the great gods grieved they had bestowed
The benefit which lewdly I for-slowed.
I wished to be received in. In I get me
To kiss. I kiss. To lie with her, she let me.
Why was I blessed? Why made king to refuse it?
Chuff-like had I not gold and could not use it?
So in a spring thrives he that told so much, 
And looks upon the fruits he cannot touch.
Hath any rose so from a fresh young maid,
As she might straight have gone to church and prayed?
Well I believe she kissed not as she should,
Nor used the sleight and cunning which she could.
Huge oaks, hard adamants might she have moved,
And with sweet words cause deaf rocks to have loved.
Worthy she was to move both gods and men,
But neither was I man, nor lived then.
Can deaf ear take delight when Phaemius sings?
Or Thamiras in curious painted things?
What sweet thought is there but I had the same?
And one gave place still as another came.
Yet, notwithstanding, like one dead it lay,
Drooping more than a rose pulled yesterday.
Now, when he should not jet, he bolts upright
And craves his task, and seeks to be at fight.
Lie down with shame, and see thou stir no more,
Seeing thou wouldst deceive me as before.
Thou cozenest me, by thee surprised am I, 
And bide sore loss with endless infamy.
Nay more, the wench did not disdain a whit
To take it in her hand and play with it.
But when she saw it would by no means stand,
But still drooped down, regarding not her hand,
Why mockst thou me?' she cried. Or, being ill,
Who bade thee lie down here against thy will?
Either thou art witch, with blood of frogs new dead,
Or jaded camest thou from some other bed.'
With that, her loose gown on, from me she cast her 
In skipping out her naked feet much graced her.
And, lest her maid should know of this disgrace,
To cover it, spilt water on the place. 






The Ballad of Villon and Fat Madge
 

'Tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation.' -Falstaff
The night cometh, when no man can work.'

What though the beauty I love and serve be cheap,
   Ought you to take me for a beast or fool?
All things a man could wish are in her keep;
   For her I turn swashbuckler in love's school.
   When folk drop in, I take my pot and stool
And fall to drinking with no more ado.
I fetch them bread, fruit, cheese, and water, too;
   I say all's right so long as I'm well paid;
Look in again when your flesh troubles you,
   Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.'

But soon the devil's among us flesh and fell,
   When penniless to bed comes Madge my whore;
I loathe the very sight of her like hell.
   I snatch gown, girdle, surcoat, all she wore,
   And tell her, these shall stand against her score.
She grips her hips with both hands, cursing God,
Swearing by Jesus' body, bones, and blood,
   That they shall not. Then I, no whit dismayed,
Cross her cracked nose with some stray shiver of wood
   Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.

When all's made up she drops me a windy word,
   Bloat like a beetle puffed and poisonous:
Grins, thumps my pate, and calls me dickey-bird,
   And cuffs me with a fist that's ponderous.
   We sleep like logs, being drunken both of us;
Then when we wake her womb begins to stir;
To save her seed she gets me under her
   Wheezing and whining, flat as planks are laid:
And thus she spoils me for a whoremonger
   Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.

Blow, hail or freeze, I've bread here baked rent free!
Whoring's my trade, and my whore pleases me;
   Bad cat, bad rat; we're just the same if weighed.
We that love filth, filth follows us, you see;
Honour flies from us, as from her we flee
   Inside this brothel where we drive our trade.

                  I bequeath likewise to fat Madge
                     This little song to learn and study;
                  By god's head she's a sweet fat fadge,
                     Devout and soft of flesh and ruddy;
                  I love her with my soul and body,
                  So doth she me, sweet dainty thing.
                     If you fall in with such a lady,
                  Read it, and give it her to sing. 







The Geranium
 

In the close covert of a grove
By nature formed for scenes of love,
Said Susan in a lucky hour:
Observe yon sweet geranium flower.
How straight upon its stalk it stands,
And tempts our violating hands,
Whilst the soft bud, as yet unspread,
Hangs down its pale declining head.
Yet soon as it is ripe to blow,
The stems shall rise, the head shall glow.'
Nature,' said I, my lovely Sue,
To all her followers lends a clue.
Her simple laws themselves explain
As links of one continued chain;
For her the mysteries of creation
Are but the works of generation.
Yon blushing, strong, triumphant flower
Is in the crisis of its power:
But short, alas, its vigorous reign;
He sheds his seed, and drops again.
The bud that hangs in pale decay
Feels not, as yet, the plastic ray.
Tomorrow's sun shall bid him rise,
Then, too, he sheds his seed, and dies.
But words, my love, are vain and weak; 
For proof, let bright example speak.'
Then straight before the wondering maid
The tree of life I gently laid.
Observe, sweet Sue, his drooping head,
How pale, how languid, and how dead.
Yet let the sun of thy bright eyes
Shine but a moment, it shall rise.
Let but the dew of thy soft hand
Refresh the stem, it straight shall stand.
Already, see, it swells, it grows,
Its head is redder than the rose,
Its shriveled fruit, of dusky hue,
Now glows--a present fit for Sue.
The balm of life each artery fills,
And in o'erflowing drops distils.'
Oh, me!' cried Susan, When is this?
What strange tumultuous throbs of bliss!
Sure, never mortal till this hour
Felt such emotion at a flower!
Oh, serpent, cunning to deceive,
Sure 'tis this tree that tempted Eve.
The crimson apples hang so fair
Alas! what woman could forbear?'
Well hast thou guessed, my love,' I cried,
It is the tree by which she died 
The tree which could alone content her.
All nature, Susan, seeks the centre.
Yet let us still poor Eve forgive,
It's the tree by which we live.
For lovely women still it grows,
And in the centre only blows.
But chief for thee it spreads its charms,
For paradise is in thy arms '
I ceased, for nature kindly here
Began to whisper in her ear,
And lovely Sue lay softly panting
While the geranium tree was planting,
'Til in the heat of amorous strife
She burst the mellow tree of life.
Oh, heaven!' cried Susan with a sigh,
The hour we taste  we surely die.
Strange raptures seize my fainting frame,
And all my body glows with flame.
Yet let me snatch one parting kiss
To tell my love I die with bliss 
That pleased thy Susan yields her breath;
Oh, who would live, if this be death?'






A True Maid
 

No, no; for my virginity,
    When I lose that, says Rose, I'll die:
Behind the elms, last night, cried Dick,
    Rose, were you not extremely sick?






from The Rape of Lucrece
 

Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under, 

Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;

Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,

Swelling on either side to want his bliss;

Between whose hills her head entombed is;

    Where like a virtuous monument she lies,

    To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.


Without the bed her other fair hand was,

On the green coverlet, whose perfect white

Showed like an April daisy on the grass,

With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.

Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,

    And canopied in darkness sweetly lay

    Till they might open to adorn the day.


Her hair like golden threads played with her breath

O modest wantons, wanton modesty!

Showing life's triumph in the map of death,

And death's dim look in life's mortality.

Each in her sleep themselves so beautify

    As if between them twain there were no strife,

    But that life lived in death, and death in life.


Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,

A pair of maiden worlds unconquerd,

Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,

And him by oath they truly honourd.

These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred,

    Who like a foul usurper went about

    From this fair throne to heave the owner out.


What could he see but mightily he noted?

What did he note but strongly he desired?

What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,

And in his will his willful eye he tired.

With more than admiration he admired

    Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,

    Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.


As the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey

Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,

So o'er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,

His rage of lust by gazing qualified;

Slacked, not suppressed; for, standing by her side,

    His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,

    Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.


And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,

Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting.

In bloody death and ravishment delighting,

Nor children's tears nor mothers' groans respecting,

Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting.

    Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,

    Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.


His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,

His eye commends the leading to his hand;

His hand, as proud of such a dignity,

Smoking with pride, marched on to make his stand

On her bare breast, the heart of all her land,

    Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,

    Left their round turrets destitute and pale.


They, mustering to the quiet cabinet

Where their dear governess and lady lies,

Do tell her she is dreadfully beset

And fright her with confusion of their cries.

She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,

    Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,

    Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.


Imagine her as one in dead of night

From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,

That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,

Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking.

What terror tis! but she, in worser taking,

    From sleep disturbd, heedfully doth view

    The sight which makes supposd terror true.


Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,

Like to a new-killed bird she trembling lies.

She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears

Quick-shifting antics ugly in her eyes.

Such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries,

    Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,

    In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.


His hand, that yet remains upon her breast

(Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!)

May feel her heart (poor citizen) distressed,

Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,

Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.

    This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,

    To make the breach and enter this sweet city. 








from The Sleepers
 

I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies of the sea, 
His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs, 
I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes, 
I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on the rocks. 

What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves? 
Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime of his middle-age? 

Steady and long he struggles, 
He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his strength holds out, 
The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away, they roll him, swing him, turn him, 
His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is continually bruis'd on rocks, 
Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse. 






O Tan-Faced Prairie-Boy
 

O tan-faced prairie-boy,

Before you came to camp came many a welcome gift,

Praises and presents came and nourishing food, till at last among the recruits,

You came, taciturn, with nothing to give  we but look'd on each other,

When lo! more than all the gifts of the world you gave me. 







A Glimpse
 

A glimpse through an interstice caught,

Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar-room around the stove late of a winter night, and I unremark'd seated in a corner,

Of a youth who loves me and whom I love, silently approaching and seating himself near, that he may hold me by the hand,

A long while amid the noises of coming and going, of drinking and oath and smutty jest,

There we two, content, happy in being together, speaking little, perhaps not a word.







To the Fair Clorinda
 

WHO MADE LOVE TO ME, IMAGIN'D MORE THAN WOMAN
Fair lovely Maid, or if that Title be 
Too weak, too Feminine for Nobler thee, 
Permit a Name that more Approaches Truth: 
And let me call thee, Lovely Charming Youth. 
This last will justifie my soft complainte, 
While that may serve to lessen my constraint; 
And without Blushes I the Youth persue, 
When so much beauteous Woman is in view 
Against thy Charms we struggle but in vain 
With thy deluding Form thou giv'st us pain, 
While the bright Nymph betrays us to the Swain. 
In pity to our Sex sure thou wer't sent, 
That we might Love, and yet be Innocent: 
For sure no Crime with thee we can commit; 
Or if we shou'd  thy Form excuses it. 
For who, that gathers fairest Flowers believes 
A Snake lies hid beneath the Fragrant Leaves. 

    Thou beauteous Wonder of a different kind, 
Soft Cloris with the dear Alexis join'd; 
When e'er the Manly part of thee, wou'd plead 
Thou tempts us with the Image of the Maid, 
While we the noblest Passions do extend 
The Love to Hermes, Aphrodite the Friend.   






Now
 

Out of your whole life give but one moment!

All of your life that has gone before,

All to come after it,  so you ignore,

So you make perfect the present,  condense,

In a rapture of rage, for perfection's endowment,

Thought and feeling and soul and sense 

Merged in a moment which gives me at last

You around me for once, you beneath me, above me  

Me  sure that despite of time future, time past, 

This tick of our life-time's one moment you love me!

How long such suspension may linger? Ah, Sweet 

The moment eternal  just that and no more  

When ecstasy's utmost we clutch at the core

While cheeks burn, arms open, eyes shut and lips meet!







She Lay All Naked
 

She lay all naked in her bed,
    And I myself lay by;
No veil but curtains about her spread,
    No covering but I:
Her head upon her shoulders seeks
    To hang in careless wise,
And full of blushes was her cheeks,
    And of wishes were her eyes.

Her blood still fresh into her face,
    As on a message came,
To say that in another place
    It meant another game;
Her cherry lip moist, plump, and fair,
    Millions of kisses crown,
Which ripe and uncropped dangle there,
    And weigh the branches down.

Her breasts, that welled so plump and high
    Bred pleasant pain in me,
For all the world I do defy
    The like felicity;
Her thighs and belly, soft and fair,
    To me were only shown:
To have seen such meat, and not to have eat,
    Would have angered any stone.

Her knees lay upward gently bent,
    And all lay hollow under,
As if on easy terms, they meant
    To fall unforced asunder;
Just so the Cyprian Queen did lie,
    Expecting in her bower;
When too long stay had kept the boy
    Beyond his promised hour.

Dull clown,' quoth she, why dost delay
    such proffered bliss to take?
Canst thou find out no other way
    Similitudes to make?'
Mad with delight I thundering
    Throw my arms about her,
But pox upon't 'twas but a dream.
    And so I lay without her.







To Anthea
 

Let's call for Hymen if agreed thou art  
Delays in love but crucify the heart.
Love's thorny tapers yet neglected lie;
Speak thou the word, they'll kindle by and by.
The nimble hours woo us on to wed,
And Genius waits to have us both to bed.
Behold, for us the naked Graces stay
With maunds of roses for us to strew the way.
Besides, the most religious prophet stands
Ready to join as well our hearts as hands.
June yet smiles; but if she chance to chide,
Ill luck 'twill bode to th'bridegroom and the bride.
Tell me Anthea, dost thou fondly dread
The loss of that we call a maidenhead?
Come, I'll instruct thee. Know, the vestal fire
Is not by marriage quenched, but flames the higher.






The Milkmaids Epithalamium
 

Joy to the bridegroom and the bride
That lie by one another's side!
O fie upon the virgin beds,
No loss is gain but maidenheads.
Love quickly send the time may be
When I shall deal my rosemary!

I long to simper at a feast,
To dance, and kiss, and do the rest.
When I shall wed, and bedded be
O then the qualm comes over me,
And tells the sweetness of a theme
That I ne'er knew but in a dream.

You ladies have the blessed nights,
I pine in hope of such delights.
And silly damsel only can
Milk the cows' teats and think on man:
And sigh and wish to taste and prove
The wholesome sillabub of love.

Make haste, at once twin-brothers bear;
And leave new matter for a star.
Women and ships are never shown
So fair as when their sails be blown.
Then when the midwife hears your moan,
I'll sigh for grief that I have none.

And you, dear knight, whose every kiss
Reaps the full crop of Cupid's bliss,
Now you have found, confess and tell
That single sheets do make up hell.
And then so charitable be
To get a man to pity me.







The Posture
 

Of like importance is the posture too, 
In which the genial feat of Love we do: 
For as the females of the four foot kind, 
Receive the leapings of their Males behind; 
So the good Wives, with loins uplifted high, 
And leaning on their hands the fruitful stroke may try: 
For in that posture will they best conceive: 
Not when supinely laid they frisk and heave; 
For active motions only break the blow, 
And more of Strumpets than of Wives they show; 
When answering stroke with stroke, the mingled liquors flow. 
Endearments eager, and too brisk a bound, 
Throws off the Plow-share from the furrow'd ground. 
But common Harlots in conjunction heave, 
Because 'tis less their business to conceive 
Than to delight, and to provoke the deed; 
A trick which honest Wives but little need. 






Down, Wanton, Down!
 

Down, wanton, down! Have you no shame 
That at the whisper of Love's name, 
Or Beauty's, presto! up you raise 
Your angry head and stand at gaze? 

Poor Bombard-captain, sworn to reach 
The ravelin and effect a breach    
Indifferent what you storm or why, 
So be that in the breach you die! 

Love may be blind, but Love at least 
Knows what is man and what mere beast; 
Or Beauty wayward, but requires 
More delicacy from her squires. 

Tell me, my witless, whose one boast 
Could be your staunchness at the post, 
When were you made a man of parts 
To think fine and profess the arts? 

Will many-gifted Beauty come 
Bowing to your bald rule of thumb, 
Or Love swear loyalty to your crown? 
Be gone, have done! Down, wanton, down! 






Madrigal: "Like the Idalian queen"
 

Like the Idalian queen,
Her hair about her eyne,
With neck and breast's ripe apples to be seen,
At first glance of the morn
In Cyprus' gardens gathering those fair flowers
Which of her blood were born,
I saw, but fainting saw, my paramours.
The Graces naked danced about the place,
The winds and trees amazed
With silence on her gazed,
The flowers did smile, like those upon her face;
And as their aspen stalks those fingers band,
That she might read my case,
A hyacinth I wished me in her hand.






from Georgics, III
 

    Thus every Creature, and of every Kind,
The secret Joys of sweet Coition find:
Not only Man's Imperial Race; but they
That wing the liquid Air, or swim the Sea,
Or haunt the Desert, rush into the flame:
For Love is Lord of all; and is in all the same.
    'Tis with this rage, the Mother Lion stung,
Scours o're the Plain; regardless of her young:
Demanding Rites of Love, she sternly stalks;
And hunts her Lover in his lonely Walks.
    'Tis then the shapeless Bear his Den forsakes;
In Woods and Fields a wild destruction makes.
Boars whet their Tusks; to battle Tygers move;
Enrag'd with hunger, more enrag'd with love.
Then wo to him, that in the desert Land
Of Lybia travels, o're the burning Sand.
The Stallion snuffs the well-known Scent afar;
And snorts and trembles for the distant Mare:
Nor bitts nor Bridles, can his rage restrain;
And rugged Rocks are interpos'd in vain.

He makes his way o're Mountains, and contemns
Unruly Torrents, and unfoorded Streams.
The bristled Boar, who feels the pleasing wound,
New grinds his arming Tusks, and digs the ground.
The sleepy Leacher shuts his little Eyes;
About his churning Chaps the frothy bubbles rise:
He rubs his sides against a Tree; prepares
And hardens both his Shoulders for the Wars.






Ode 44
 

Last night, as half asleep I dreaming lay, 
    Half naked came she in her little shift, 
         With tilted glass, and verses on her lips; 
Narcissus-eyes all shining for the fray, 
         Filled full of frolic to her wine-red lips, 
         Warm as a dewy rose, sudden she slips 
    Into my bed  just in her little shift. 

Said she, half naked, half asleep, half heard, 
With a soft sigh betwixt each lazy word, 
Oh my old lover, do you sleep or wake!' 
And instant I sat upright for her sake, 
And drank whatever wine she poured for me    
Wine of the tavern, or vintage it might be 
Of Heaven's own vine: he surely were a churl 
Who refused wine poured out by such a girl, 
A double traitor he to wine and love. 
Go to, thou puritan! the gods above 
Ordained this wine for us, but not for thee; 
Drunkards we are by a divine decree, 
Yea, by the special privilege of heaven 
Foredoomed to drink and foreordained forgiven.   

Ah! HAFIZ, you are not the only man 
    Who promised penitence and broke down after; 
For who can keep so hard a promise, man,   
    With wine and woman brimming o'er with laughter! 
O knotted locks, filled like a flower with scent, 
How have you ravished this poor penitent! 






Ode 487
 

With last night's wine still singing in my head, 
I sought the tavern at the break of day, 
Though half the world was still asleep in bed; 
The harp and flute were up and in full swing, 
And a most pleasant morning sound made they; 
Already was the wine-cup on the wing. 
Reason,' said I, 't is past the time to start, 
If you would reach your daily destination, 
The holy city of intoxication.'   
So did I pack him off, and he depart 
With a stout flask for fellow-traveller. 

Left to myself, the tavern-wench I spied, 
And sought to win her love by speaking fair; 
Alas! she turned upon me, scornful-eyed, 
And mocked my foolish hopes of winning her. 
Said she, her arching eyebrows like a bow: 
Thou mark for all the shafts of evil tongues! 
Thou shalt not round my middle clasp me so, 
Like my good girdle  not for all thy songs!  
So long as thou in all created things 
Seest but thyself the centre and the end. 
Go spread thy dainty nets for other wings  
Too high the Anca's nest for thee, my friend.' 

Then took I shelter from that stormy sea 
In the good ark of wine; yet, woe is me! 
Saki and comrade and minstrel all by turns, 
She is of maidens the compendium 
Who my poor heart in such a fashion spurns. 
Self, HAFIZ, self! That thou must overcome! 
Hearken the wisdom of the tavern-daughter! 
Vain little baggage  well, upon my word! 
Thou fairy figment made of clay and water, 
As busy with thy beauty as a bird. 

Well, HAFIZ, Life's a riddle  give it up: 
There is no answer to it but this cup.   







Jenny Kissd Me
 

Jenny kiss'd me when we met, 
    Jumping from the chair she sat in;
Time, you thief, who love to get
    Sweets into your list, put that in!
Say I'm weary, say I'm sad,
    Say that health and wealth have miss'd me,
Say I'm growing old, but add,
    Jenny kiss'd me.






White Heliotrope
 

The feverish room and that white bed, 
The tumbled skirts upon a chair,   
The novel flung half-open, where 
Hat, hair-pins, puffs, and paints are spread; 

The mirror that has sucked your face 
Into its secret deep of deeps, 
And there mysteriously keeps 
Forgotten memories of grace; 

And you half dressed and half awake, 
Your slant eyes strangely watching me, 
And I, who watch you drowsily, 
With eyes that, having slept not, ache; 

This (need one dread? nay, dare one hope?) 
Will rise, a ghost of memory, if 
Ever again my handkerchief 
Is scented with White Heliotrope.





After Death
 

The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept

    And strewn with rushes, rosemary and may

Lay thick upon the bed on which I lay,

Where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept.

He leaned above me, thinking that I slept

    And could not hear him; but I heard him say,

    Poor child, poor child': and as he turned away

Came a deep silence, and I knew he wept.

He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold

    That hid my face, or take my hand in his,

         Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head:

         He did not love me living; but once dead

    He pitied me; and very sweet it is

To know he still is warm though I am cold.







from Anactoria
 

after Sappho
Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine, 
Except these kisses of my lips on thine 
Brand them with immortality; but me  
Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea, 
Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold 
Cast forth of heaven, with feet of awful gold 
And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind, 
Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind 
Hunting through fields unfurrowed and unsown, 
But in the light and laughter, in the moan 
And music, and in grasp of lip and hand 
And shudder of water that makes felt on land 
The immeasurable tremor of all the sea, 
Memories shall mix and metaphors of me. 






The Lost Mistress
 

All's over, then: does truth sound bitter

    As one at first believes?

Hark, 'tis the sparrows' good-night twitter

    About your cottage eaves!


And the leaf-buds on the vine are woolly,

    I noticed that, today;

One day more bursts them open fully

     You know the red turns grey.


Tomorrow we meet the same then, dearest?

    May I take your hand in mine?

Mere friends are we,  well, friends the merest

    Keep much that I resign:


For each glance of the eye so bright and black,

    Though I keep with heart's endeavor, 

Your voice, when you wish the snowdrops back,

    Though it stay in my soul for ever! 


Yet I will but say what mere friends say,

    Or only a thought stronger;

I will hold your hand but as long as all may,

    Or so very little longer! 







"I wish I could remember that first day"
 

Era gia l'ora che volge il desio.   Dante
Ricorro al tempo ch'io vi vidi prima.  Petrarca

I wish I could remember that first day, 

    First hour, first moment of your meeting me,

    If bright or dim the season, it might be

Summer or Winter for aught I can say;

So unrecorded did it slip away,

    So blind was I to see and to foresee,

    So dull to mark the budding of my tree

That would not blossom yet for many a May.

If only I could recollect it, such

    A day of days! I let it come and go

    As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;

It seemed to mean so little, meant so much;

If only now I could recall that touch,

    First touch of hand in hand  Did one but know!







"I saw my Lady weep"
 

I saw my Lady weep,
And Sorrow proud to be advanced so
In those fair eyes, where all perfections keep;
    Her face was full of woe,
But such a woe (believe me) as wins more hearts
Than mirth can do, with her enticing parts.

Sorrow was there made fair,
And Passion, wise; Tears, a delightful thing;
Silence, beyond all speech, a wisdom rare;
    She made her sighs to sing,
And all things with so sweet a sadness move;
As made my heart both grieve and love.

O Fairer than aught else
The world can shew, leave off, in time, to grieve,
Enough, enough! Your joyful look excels;
    Tears kill the heart, believe, 
O strive not to be excellent in woe,
Which only breeds your beauty's overthrow.






Epistle to Miss Blount, On Her Leaving the Town, After the Coronation
 

As some fond virgin, whom her mother's care

Drags from the town to wholesome country air, 

Just when she learns to roll a melting eye, 

And hear a spark, yet think no danger nigh;

From the dear man unwillingly she must sever,

Yet takes one kiss before she parts for ever:

Thus from the world fair Zephalinda flew,

Saw others happy, and with sighs withdrew;

Not that their pleasures caused her discontent,

She sighed not that They stayed, but that She went.

    She went, to plain-work, and to purling brooks,

Old-fashioned halls, dull aunts, and croaking rooks,

She went from Opera, park, assembly, play,

To morning walks, and prayers three hours a day;

To pass her time twixt reading and Bohea,

To muse, and spill her solitary tea,

Or o'er cold coffee trifle with the spoon,

Count the slow clock, and dine exact at noon;

Divert her eyes with pictures in the fire,

Hum half a tune, tell stories to the squire;

Up to her godly garret after seven,

There starve and pray, for that's the way to heaven.

   Some Squire, perhaps, you take a delight to rack; 

Whose game is Whisk, whose treat a toast in sack,

Who visits with a gun, presents you birds,

Then gives a smacking buss, and cries  No words!

Or with his hound comes hollowing from the stable,

Makes love with nods, and knees beneath a table;

Whose laughs are hearty, tho' his jests are coarse,

And loves you best of all things  but his horse.

    In some fair evening, on your elbow laid,

Your dream of triumphs in the rural shade;

In pensive thought recall the fancied scene,

See Coronations rise on every green;

Before you pass th' imaginary sights

Of Lords, and Earls, and Dukes, and gartered Knights;

While the spread fan o'ershades your closing eyes;

Then give one flirt, and all the vision flies.

Thus vanish scepters, coronets, and balls,

And leave you in lone woods, or empty walls.

    So when your slave, at some dear, idle time,

(Not plagued with headaches, or the want of rhyme)

Stands in the streets, abstracted from the crew,

And while he seems to study, thinks of you:

Just when his fancy points your sprightly eyes,

Or sees the blush of soft Parthenia rise,

Gay pats my shoulder, and you vanish quite;

Streets, chairs, and coxcombs rush upon my sight;

Vexed to be still in town, I knit my brow,

Look sour, and hum a tune  as you may now. 







Sonnet 98: From you have I been absent in the spring
 

From you have I been absent in the spring, 
When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim, 
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything, 
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him. 
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell 
Of different flowers in odour and in hue, 
Could make me any summer's story tell, 
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew: 
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white, 
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose; 
They were but sweet, but figures of delight 
Drawn after you,  you pattern of all those. 
    Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away, 
    As with your shadow I with these did play.





Somewhere or Other
 

Somewhere or other there must surely be

    The face not seen, the voice not heard,

The heart that not yet--never yet--ah me!

    Made answer to my word.


Somewhere or other, may be near or far;

    Past land and sea, clean out of sight;

Beyond the wandering moon, beyond the star

    That tracks her night by night.


Somewhere or other, may be far or near;

    With just a wall, a hedge, between;

With just the last leaves of the dying year

    Fallen on a turf grown green.







To Mrs. M. A. Upon Absence
 

'Tis now since I began to die
    Four months, yet still I gasping live;
Wrapp'd up in sorrow do I lie,
    Hoping, yet doubting a reprieve.
Adam from Paradise expell'd
Just such a wretched being held.

'Tis not thy love I fear to lose,
    That will in spite of absence hold;
But 'tis the benefit and use
    Is lost, as in imprison'd gold:
Which though the sum be ne'er so great,
Enriches nothing but conceit.

What angry star then governs me
    That I must feel a double smart,
Prisoner to fate as well as thee;
    Kept from thy face, link'd to thy heart?
Because my love all love excels,
Must my grief have no parallels?

Sapless and dead as Winter here
    I now remain, and all I see
Copies of my wild state appear,
    But I am their epitome.
Love me no more, for I am grown
Too dead and dull for thee to own. 







"As Love and I, late harbour'd in one inn"
 

As Love and I, late harbour'd in one inn,

With proverbs thus each other entertain:

In love there is no lack, thus I begin,

Fair words make fools, replieth he again;

Who spares to speak, doth spare to speed (quoth I),

As well (saith he) too forward, as too slow;

Fortune assists the boldest, I reply,

A hasty man (quoth he) ne'er wanted woe;

Labour is light, where love (quoth I) doth pay,

(Saith he) light burthen's heavy, if far born;

(Quoth I) the main lost, cast the bye away;

You have spun a fair thread, he replies in scorn.

    And having thus awhile each other thwarted,

    Fools as we met, so fools again we parted. 







"I loved you first: but afterwards your love"
 

Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda.   Dante
Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore.   Petrarca

I loved you first: but afterwards your love

    Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song

As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.

    Which owes the other most? my love was long,

    And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;

I loved and guessed at you, you construed me

And loved me for what might or might not be 

    Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.

For verily love knows not mine' or thine;'

    With separate I' and thou' free love has done,

         For one is both and both are one in love:

Rich love knows nought of thine that is not mine;'

         Both have the strength and both the length thereof,

Both of us, of the love which makes us one.







"Many in aftertimes will say of you"
 

Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti.   Dante
Contando i casi della vita nostra.   Petrarca

Many in aftertimes will say of you

    He loved her'  while of me what will they say?

    Not that I loved you more than just in play,

For fashion's sake as idle women do.

Even let them prate; who know not what we knew

    Of love and parting in exceeding pain.

    Of parting hopeless here to meet again,

Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.

But by my heart of love laid bare to you.

    My love that you can make not void nor vain,

Love that foregoes you but to claim anew

    Beyond this passage of the gate of death,

I charge you at the Judgment make it plain

    My love of you was life and not a breath.







When I Heard at the Close of the Day
 

When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv'd with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for me that follow'd,

And else when I carous'd, or when my plans were accomplish'd, still I was not happy,

But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refresh'd, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,

When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light,

When I wander'd alone over the beach, and undressing bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise,

And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming, O then I was happy,

O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food nourish'd me more, and the beautiful day pass'd well,

And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening came my friend,

And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores,

I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me, 

For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night,

In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me,

And his arm lay lightly around my breast  and that night I was happy.







Love and Sleep
 

Lying asleep between the strokes of night 
    I saw my love lean over my sad bed, 
    Pale as the duskiest lily's leaf or head, 
Smooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite, 
Too wan for blushing and too warm for white, 
    But perfect-coloured without white or red. 
    And her lips opened amorously, and said  
I wist not what, saving one word  Delight. 

And all her face was honey to my mouth, 
    And all her body pasture to mine eyes; 
         The long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire, 
The quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south, 
    The bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs 
         And glittering eyelids of my soul's desire.   






"Doing, a filthy pleasure is, and short"
 

Doing, a filthy pleasure is, and short;
And done, we straight repent us of the sport:
Let us not then rush blindly on unto it,
Like lustful beasts, that only know to do it:
For lust will languish, and that heat decay.
But thus, thus, keeping endless holiday,
Let us together closely lie and kiss,
There is no labour, nor no shame in this;
This hath pleased, doth please, and long will please; never
Can this decay, but is beginning ever.






Vobiscum Est Iope
 

When thou must home to shades of underground,
And there arrived, a new admird guest,
The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,
White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,
To hear the stories of thy finished love
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;

Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,
Of masques and revels which sweet youth did make,
Of tourneys and great challenges of knights,
And all these triumphs for thy beauty's sake:
When thou hast told these honours done to thee,
Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me!






Astrophil and Stella 30: "With how sad steps, O moon, thou climb'st the skies!"
 

With how sad steps, O moon, thou climb'st the skies! 
How silently, and with how wan a face! 
What! may it be that even in heavenly place 
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries? 
Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes 
Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case: 
I read it in thy looks; thy languished grace 
To me, that feel the like, thy state descries. 
Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me, 
Is constant love deemed there but want of wit? 
Are beauties there as proud as here they be? 
Do they above love to be loved, and yet 
    Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess? 
    Do they call virtue' there--ungratefulness? 






from Odes, Book Three, 15
 

I 

A Tower of Brass, one would have said, 
And Locks, and Bolts, and Iron Bars,   
Might have preserv'd one innocent Maiden-head. 
The jealous Father thought he well might spare 
All further jealous Care. 
And, as he walk'd, t'himself alone he smiled, 
To think how Venus' Arts he had beguil'd; 
         And when he slept, his Rest was deep: 
         But Venus laugh'd, to see and hear him sleep: 
                  She taught the am'rous Jove 
                  A magical Receipt in Love, 
Which arm'd him stronger, and which help'd him more, 
Than all his Thunder did, and his Almightyship before. 


II 

She taught him Love's Elixir, by which Art 
His Godhead into Gold he did convert; 
         No Guards did then his Passage stay,   
         He pass'd with Ease, Gold was the Word; 
Subtle as Light'ning, bright, and quick, and fierce, 
Gold thro' Doors and Walls did pierce; 
And as that works sometimes upon the Sword, 
         Melted the Maidenhead away, 
         Ev'n in the secret Scabbard where it lay. 
         The prudent Macedonian King, 
         To blow up Towns a Golden Mine did spring; 
         He broke thro' Gates with this Petarr, 
         'Tis the great Art of Peace, the Engine 'tis of War; 
And Fleets and Armies follow it afar; 
The Ensign 'tis at Land: and 'tis the Seaman's Star. 






Elegies, Book One, 5
 

after Ovid
In summer's heat and mid-time of the day
To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,
One window shut, the other open stood,
Which gave such light as twinkles in a wood,
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun
Or night being past, and yet not day begun.
Such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown,
Where they may sport, and seem to be unknown.
Then came Corinna in a long loose gown,
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed
Or Las of a thousand wooers sped.
I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,
Yet strived she to be covered therewithal.
And striving thus as one that would be cast,
Betrayed herself, and yielded at the last.
Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,
Not one wen in her body could I spy.

What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me?
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?
How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?
To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,
I clinged her naked body, down she fell,
Judge you the rest: being tired she bad me kiss,
Jove send me more such afternoons as this. 






In the Orchard
 

Leave go my hands, let me catch breath and see; 
Let the dew-fall drench either side of me; 
    Clear apple-leaves are soft upon that moon 
Seen sidelong like a blossom in the tree; 
    And God, ah God, that day should be so soon. 

The grass is thick and cool, it lets us lie. 
Kissed upon either cheek and either eye, 
    I turn to thee as some green afternoon 
Turns toward sunset, and is loth to die; 
    Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. 

Lie closer, lean your face upon my side, 
Feel where the dew fell that has hardly dried, 
    Hear how the blood beats that went nigh to swoon; 
The pleasure lives there when the sense has died, 
    Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. 

O my fair lord, I charge you leave me this: 
It is not sweeter than a foolish kiss? 
    Nay take it then, my flower, my first in June, 
My rose, so like a tender mouth it is: 
    Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. 

Love, till dawn sunder night from day with fire 
Dividing my delight and my desire, 
    The crescent life and love the plenilune, 
Love me though dusk begin and dark retire; 
    Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. 

Ah, my heart fails, my blood draws back; I know, 
When life runs over, life is near to go; 
    And with the slain of love love's ways are strewn, 
And with their blood, if love will have it so; 
    Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. 

Ah, do thy will now; slay me if thou wilt; 
There is no building now the walls are built, 
    No quarrying now the corner-stone is hewn, 
No drinking now the vine's whole blood is spilt; 
    Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. 

Nay, slay me now; nay, for I will be slain; 
Pluck thy red pleasure from the teeth of pain, 
    Break down thy vine ere yet grape-gatherers prune, 
Slay me ere day can slay desire again; 
    Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. 

Yea, with thy sweet lips, with thy sweet sword; yea 
Take life and all, for I will die, I say; 
    Love, I gave love, is life a better boon? 
For sweet night's sake I will not live till day; 
    Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. 

Nay, I will sleep then only; nay, but go. 
Ah sweet, too sweet to me, my sweet, I know 
    Love, sleep, and death go to the sweet same tune; 
Hold my hair fast, and kiss me through it soon. 
    Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. 







A Song: Ask me no more where Jove bestows
 

Ask me no more where Jove bestows, 
When June is past, the fading rose; 
For in your beauty's orient deep 
These flowers, as in their causes, sleep. 

Ask me no more whither do stray 
The golden atoms of the day; 
For in pure love heaven did prepare 
Those powders to enrich your hair. 

Ask me no more whither doth haste 
The nightingale, when May is past; 
For in your sweet dividing throat 
She winters, and keeps warm her note. 

Ask me no more where those stars 'light, 
That downwards fall in dead of night; 
For in your eyes they sit, and there 
Fixed become, as in their sphere. 

Ask me no more if east or west 
The phoenix builds her spicy nest; 
For unto you at last she flies, 
And in your fragrant bosom dies. 






"Kissd yestreen"
 

Kiss'd yestreen, and kiss'd yestreen,
Up the Gallowgate, down the Green:
I've woo'd wi' lords, and woo'd wi' lairds,
I've mool'd wi carles and mell'd wi' cairds,
I've kiss'd wi' priests-- twas done i' the dark,
Twice in my gown and thrice in my sark;
But priest, nor lord, nor loon can gie
Sic kindly kisses as he gae me.






To Cupid
 

Child, with many a childish wile,
Timid look, and blushing smile,
Downy wings to steal thy way,
Gilded bow, and quiver gay,
Who in thy simple mien would trace
The tyrant of the human race?

Who is he whose flinty heart
Hath not felt the flying dart?
Who is he that from the wound
Hath not pain and pleasure found?
Who is he that hath not shed
Curse and blessing on thy head?






Love's Witness
 

Slight unpremeditated Words are borne
    By every common Wind into the Air;
Carelessly utter'd, die as soon as born,
    And in one instant give both Hope and Fear:
Breathing all Contraries with the same Wind
According to the Caprice of the Mind.

But Billetdoux are constant Witnesses,
    Substantial Records to Eternity;
Just Evidences, who the Truth confess,
    On which the Lover safely may rely;
They're serious Thoughts, digested and resolv'd;
And last, when Words are into Clouds devolv'd.






from To Alexis In Answer to His Poem Against Fruition
 

Since man with that inconstancy was born,
To love the absent, and the present scorn
    Why do we deck, why do we dress
    For such short-lived happiness?
    Why do we put attraction on,
Since either way 'tis we must be undone?

    They fly if honour take our part,
    Our virtue drives 'em o'er the field.
    We love 'em by too much desert,
    And oh! they fly us if we yield.
Ye gods! is there no charm in all the fair
To fix this wild, this faithless wanderer?

    Man! our great business and our aim,
    For whom we spread our fruitless snares,
No sooner kindles the designing flame,
    But to the next bright object bears
The trophies of his conquest and our shame:
    Inconstancy's the good supreme
The rest is airy notion, empty dream!

    Then heedless nymph, be rul'd by me
    If e're your swain the bliss desire;
          Think like Alexis he may be
          Whose wisht possession damps his fire;
          The roving youth in every shade
Has left some sighing and abandon'd maid,
For 'tis a fatal lesson he has learn'd,
After fruition ne'er to be concern'd.







Song
 

O Love! that stronger art than wine, 
Pleasing delusion, witchery divine, 
Wont to be prized above all wealth, 
Disease that has more joys than health; 
Though we blaspheme thee in our pain, 
And of thy tyranny complain, 
We are all bettered by they reign. 
       
What reason never can bestow 
We to this useful passion owe; 
Love wakes the dull from sluggish ease, 
And learns a clown the art to please, 
Humbles the vain, kindles the cold, 
Makes misers free, and cowards bold; 
'Tis he reforms the sot from drink, 
And teaches airy fops to think. 

When full brute appetite is fed, 
And choked the glutton lies and dead, 
Thou new spirits dost dispense 
And 'finest the gross delights of sense: 
Virtue's unconquerable aid 
That against Nature can persuade, 
And makes a roving mind retire 
Within the bounds of just desire; 
Cheerer of age, youth's kind unrest, 
And half the heaven of the blest! 






Oh, How the Hand the Lover Ought to Prize
 

Oh, how the hand the lover ought to prize
    'Bove any one peculiar grace!
While he is dying for the eyes
    And doting on the lovely face,
The unconsid'ring little knows
How much he to this beauty owes.

That, when the lover absent is,
    Informs him of his mistress' heart;
'Tis that which gives him all his bliss
    When dear love-secrets 'twill impart:
That plights the faith the maid bestows,
And that confirms the tim'rous vows.

'Tis that betrays the tenderness
    Which the too bashful tongue denies;
'Tis that which does the heart confess,
    And spares the language of the eyes;
'Tis that which treasure gives so vast,
Ev'n Iris 'twill to Damon give at last.






Angellicas Lament
 

Had I remained in innocent security,
I should have thought all men were born my slaves,
And worn my power like lightning in my eyes,
To have destroyed at pleasure when offended.
--But when love held the mirror, the undeceiving glass
Reflected all the weakness of my soul, and made me know
My richest treasure being lost, my honour,
All the remaining spoil could not be worth
The conqueror's care or value.
--Oh how I fell like a long worshipped idol
Discovering all the cheat.






The Willing Mistriss
 

Amyntas led me to a Grove,
    Where all the Trees did shade us;
The Sun it self, though it had Strove,
    It could not have betray'd us:
The place secur'd from humane Eyes,
    No other fear allows.
But when the Winds that gently rise,
    Doe Kiss the yielding Boughs.

Down there we satt upon the Moss,
    And id begin to play
A Thousand Amorous Tricks, to pass
    The heat of all the day.
A many Kisses he did give:
    And I return'd the same
Which made me willing to receive
    That which I dare not name.

His Charming Eyes no Aid requir'd
    To tell their softning Tale;
On her that was already fir'd
    'Twas easy to prevaile.
He did but Kiss and Clasp me round,
    Whilst those his thoughts Exprest:
And lay'd me gently on the Ground;
    Ah who can guess the rest?







from Silent is the House
 

Come, the wind may never again
Blow as now it blows for us;
And the stars may never again shine as now they shine;
Long before October returns,
Seas of blood will have parted us;
And you must crush the love in your heart, and I the love in mine!






Love and Friendship
 

Love is like the wild rose-briar,
Friendship like the holly-tree--
The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms
But which will bloom most constantly?

The wild rose-briar is sweet in spring,
Its summer blossoms scent the air;
Yet wait till winter comes again
And who will call the wild-briar fair?

Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now
And deck thee with the holly's sheen,
That when December blights thy brow
He still may leave thy garland green.






Sonnets from the Portuguese 44:  Beloved, thou has brought me many flowers
 

Beloved, thou hast brought me many flowers

    Plucked in the garden, all the summer through

    And winter, and it seemed as if they grew

In this close room, nor missed the sun and showers,

So, in the like name of that love of ours,

    Take back these thoughts which here unfolded too,

    And which on warm and cold days I withdrew

From my heart's ground. Indeed, those beds and bowers

    Be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue,

And wait thy weeding; yet here's eglantine,

    Here's ivy!-- take them, as I used to do

Thy flowers, and keep them where they shall not pine.

    Instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true,

And tell thy soul, their roots are left in mine.







Sonnets from the Portuguese 5: I lift my heavy heart up solemnly
 

I lift my heavy heart up solemnly, 
As once Electra her sepulchral urn, 
And, looking in thine eyes, I overturn 
The ashes at thy feet. Behold and see 
What a great heap of grief lay hid in me, 
And how the red wild sparkles dimly burn 
Through the ashen greyness. If thy foot in scorn 
Could tread them out to darkness utterly, 
It might be well perhaps. But if instead 
Thou wait beside me for the wind to blow 
The grey dust up,... those laurels on thine head, 
O My beloved, will not shield thee so, 
That none of all the fires shall scorch and shred 
The hair beneath. Stand further off then! Go.





Marriage
 

No more alone sleeping, no more alone waking,
   Thy dreams divided, thy prayers in twain;
Thy merry sisters tonight forsaking,
   Never shall we see, maiden, again.

Never shall we see thee, thine eyes glancing.
   Flashing with laughter and wild in glee,
Under the mistletoe kissing and dancing,
   Wantonly free.

There shall come a matron walking sedately,
    Low-voiced, gentle, wise in reply.
Tell me, O tell me, can I love her greatly?
   All for her sake must the maiden die!






A Moment
 

The clouds had made a crimson crown
    Above the mountains high.
The stormy sun was going down
    In a stormy sky.

Why did you let your eyes so rest on me,
    And hold your breath between?
In all the ages this can never be
    As if it had not been.






Jealousy
 

The myrtle bush grew shady
Down by the ford.'
Is it even so?' said my lady.
Even so!' said my lord.
The leaves are set too thick together
For the point of a sword.

The arras in your room hangs close,
No light between!
You wedded one of those that see unseen.'
Is it even so?' said the King's Majesty.
Even so!' said the Queen.






Love Song
 

There is a strong wall about me to protect me: 
It is built of the words you have said to me. 

There are swords about me to keep me safe: 
They are the kisses of your lips. 

Before me goes a shield to guard me from harm: 
It is the shadow of your arms between me and danger. 

All the wishes of my mind know your name, 
And the white desires of my heart 
They are acquainted with you. 
The cry of my body for completeness, 
That is a cry to you. 
My blood beats out your name to me, 
    unceasing, pitiless 
Your name, your name.





A Song
 

Love, thou art best of Human Joys,

    Our chiefest Happiness below;

All other Pleasures are but Toys,

Musick without Thee is but Noise,

       And Beauty but an empty show.


Heav'n , who knew best what Man wou'd move,

    And raise his Thoughts above the Brute;

Said, Let him Be, and Let him Love;

That must alone his Soul improve,

       Howe'er Philosophers dispute.







A Letter to Daphnis
 

This to the crown and blessing of my life,

The much loved husband of a happy wife;

To him whose constant passion found the art

To win a stubborn and ungrateful heart,

And to the world by tenderest proof discovers

They err, who say that husbands can't be lovers.

With such return of passion as is due,

Daphnis I love, Daphnis my thoughts pursue;

Daphnis my hopes and joys are bounded all in you.

Even I, for Daphnis' and my promise' sake,

What I in women censure, undertake.

But this from love, not vanity, proceeds;

You know who writes, and I who 'tis that reads.

Judge not my passion by my want of skill:

Many love well, though they express it ill;

And I your censure could with pleasure bear,

Would you but soon return, and speak it here.







The Introduction
 

Did I, my lines intend for public view,

How many censures, would their faults pursue,

Some would, because such words they do affect,

Cry they're insipid, empty, and uncorrect.

And many have attained, dull and untaught,

The name of wit only by finding fault.

True judges might condemn their want of wit,

And all might say, they're by a woman writ.

Alas! a woman that attempts the pen,

Such an intruder on the rights of men,

Such a presumptuous creature, is esteemed,

The fault can by no virtue be redeemed.

They tell us we mistake our sex and way;

Good breeding, fashion, dancing, dressing, play

Are the accomplishments we should desire;

To write, or read, or think, or to inquire

Would cloud our beauty, and exhaust our time,

And interrupt the conquests of our prime;

Whilst the dull manage of a servile house

Is held by some our outmost art, and use.

    Sure 'twas not ever thus, nor are we told

Fables, of women that excelled of old;

To whom, by the diffusive hand of Heaven 

Some share of wit, and poetry was given.

On that glad day, on which the Ark returned,

The holy pledge, for which the land had mourned,

The joyful tribes, attend it on the way,

The Levites do the sacred charge convey,

Whilst various instruments, before it play;

Here, holy virgins in the concert join

The louder notes, to soften, and refine,

And with alternate verse complete the hymn divine.

Lo! the young Poet, after God's own heart,

By Him inspired, and taught the Muses' art,

Returned from conquest, a bright chorus meets,

That sing his slain ten thousand in the streets.

In such loud numbers they his acts declare,

Proclaim the wonders of his early war,

That Saul upon the vast applause does frown,

And feels its mighty thunder shake the crown.

What, can the threatened judgment now prolong?

Half of the kingdom is already gone;

The fairest half, whose influence guides the rest,

Have David's empire o'er their hearts confessed.

    A woman here, leads fainting Israel on,

She fights, she wins, she triumphs with a song,

Devout, majestic, for the subject fit,

And far above her arms, exalts her wit;

Then, to the peaceful, shady palm withdraws,

And rules the rescued nation, with her laws.

How are we fall'n, fall'n by mistaken rules?

And education's, more than nature's fools,

Debarred from all improvements of the mind,

And to be dull, expected and designed;

And if some one would soar above the rest,

With warmer fancy, and ambition pressed,

So strong th' opposing faction still appears,

The hopes to thrive can ne'er outweigh the fears,

Be cautioned then my Muse, and still retired;

Nor be despised, aiming to be admired;

Conscious of wants, still with contracted wing,

To some few friends, and to thy sorrows sing;

For groves of laurel thou wert never meant;

Be dark enough thy shades, and be thou there content.





The Spleen
 

A Pindaric Poem
What art thou, Spleen, which ev'ry thing dost ape?

   Thou Proteus to abused mankind,

   Who never yet thy real cause could find,

Or fix thee to remain in one continued shape.

   Still varying thy perplexing form,

   Now a Dead Sea thou'lt represent,

   A calm of stupid discontent,

Then, dashing on the rocks wilt rage into a storm.

   Trembling sometimes thou dost appear,

   Dissolved into a panic fear;

   On sleep intruding dost thy shadows spread,

   Thy gloomy terrors round the silent bed,

And crowd with boding dreams the melancholy head;

   Or, when the midnight hour is told,

   And drooping lids thou still dost waking hold,

   Thy fond delusions cheat the eyes,

   Before them antic specters dance,

Unusual fires their pointed heads advance,

   And airy phantoms rise.

   Such was the monstrous vision seen,

When Brutus (now beneath his cares opprest,

And all Rome's fortunes rolling in his breast,

   Before Philippi's latest field,

Before his fate did to Octavius lead)

   Was vanquished by the Spleen.


   Falsely, the mortal part we blame

   Or our depressed, and pond'rous frame,

   Which, till the first degrading sin

   Let thee, its dull attendant, in,

   Still with the other did comply,

Nor clogged the active soul, disposed to fly,

And range the mansions of its native sky.

   Nor, whilst in his own heaven he dwelt,

   Whilst Man his paradise possessed,

His fertile Garden in the fragrant East,

   And all united odors smelled,

   No armd sweets, until thy reign,

   Could shock the sense, or in the face

   A flushed, unhandsome color place.

Now the jonquil o'ercomes the feeble brain;

We faint beneath the aromatic pain,

Till some offensive scent thy pow'rs appease,

And pleasure we resign for short and nauseous ease.


   In ev'ry one thou dost possess,

   New are thy motions, and thy dress:

   Now in some grove a list'ning friend

   Thy false suggestions must attend,

Thy whispered griefs, thy fancied sorrows hear,

Breathed in a sigh, and witnessed by a tear;

   Whilst in the light and vulgar crowd,

   Thy slaves, more clamorous and loud,

By laughters unprovoked, thy influence too confess.

In the imperious wife thou vapors art,

   Which from o'erheated passions rise

   In clouds to the attractive brain,

   Until descending thence again,

   Through the o'er-cast and show'ring eyes,

   Upon her husband's softened heart,

   He the disputed point must yield,

Something resign of the contested field;

Till lordly Man, born to imperial sway,

Compounds for peace, to make that right away,

And Woman, arm'd with Spleen, does servilely obey.

   The fool, to imitate the wits,

   Complains of thy pretended fits,

   And dullness, born with him, would lay

   Upon thy accidental sway;

   Because, sometimes, thou dost presume

   Into the ablest heads to come:

   That, often, men of thoughts refined,

   Impatient of unequal sense,

Such slow returns, where they so much dispense,

Retiring from the crowd, are to thy shades inclined.

   O'er me alas! thou dost too much prevail:

   I feel thy force, whilst I against thee rail;

I feel my verse decay, and my cramped numbers fail.

Through thy black jaundice I all objects see,

   As dark and terrible as thee,

My lines decried, and my employment thought

An useless folly, or presumptuous fault:

   Whilst in the Muses' paths I stray,

Whilst in their groves, and by their secret springs

My hand delights to trace unusual things,

And deviates from the known and common way;

   Nor will in fading silks compose   

   Faintly th' inimitable rose,

Fill up an ill-drawn bird, or paint on glass

The sov'reign's blurred and undistinguished face,

The threat'ning angel, and the speaking ass.


   Patron thou art to ev'ry gross abuse,

          The sullen husband's feigned excuse, 

When the ill humor with his wife he spends,

And bears recruited wit, and spirits to his friends.

          The son of Bacchus pleads thy pow'r,

          As to the glass he still repairs,

          Pretends but to remove thy cares,

Snatch from thy shades one gay and smiling hour,

And drown thy kingdom in a purple show'r.

When the Coquette, whom ev'ry fool admires,

          Would in variety be fair,

          And, changing hastily the scene,

          From light, impertinent, and vain,

Assumes a soft, a melancholy air,

And of her eyes rebates the wand'ring fires,

The careless posture, and the head reclined,

          The thoughtful, and composd face,

   Proclaiming the withdrawn, the absent mind,

   Allows the Fop more liberty to gaze,

   Who gently for the tender cause inquires;

   The cause, indeed, is a defect in sense,

Yet is the Spleen alleged, and still the dull pretence.

          But these are thy fantastic harms, 

          The tricks of thy pernicious stage,

          Which do the weaker sort engage;

   Worse are the dire effects of thy more pow'rful charms.

          By thee Religion, all we know,

          That should enlighten here below,

          Is veiled in darkness, and perplexed

   With anxious doubts, with endless scruples vexed,

And some restraint implied from each perverted text.

   Whilst touch not, taste not, what is freely giv'n,

Is but thy niggard voice, disgracing bounteous heav'n.

   From speech restrained, by thy deceits abused,

   To deserts banished, or in cells reclused,

   Mistaken vot'ries to the pow'rs divine,

   Whilst they a purer sacrifice design,

Do but the Spleen obey, and worship at thy shrine.

   In vain to chase thee ev'ry art we try,

          In vain all remedies apply,

          In vain the Indian leaf infuse,

          Or the parched Eastern berry bruise;

Some pass, in vain, those bounds, and nobler liquors use.

          Now harmony, in vain, we bring,

          Inspire the flute, and touch the string.

          From harmony no help is had;

Music but soothes thee, if too sweetly sad,

And if too light, but turns thee gaily mad.

          Though the physicians greatest gains,

          Although his growing wealth he sees

          Daily increased by ladies' fees,

   Yet dost thou baffle all his studious pains.

          Not skillful Lower thy source could find,

   Or through the well-dissected body trace

          The secret, the mysterious ways,

By which thou dost surprise, and prey upon the mind.

Though in the search, too deep for humane thought,

   With unsuccessful toil he wrought,

'Till thinking thee to've catched, himself by thee was caught,

   Retained thy pris'ner, thy acknowledged slave,

And sunk beneath thy chain to a lamented grave.





Adam Posed
 

Could our first father, at his toilsome plow,

Thorns in his path, and labor on his brow,

Clothed only in a rude, unpolished skin,

Could he a vain fantastic nymph have seen,

In all her airs, in all her antic graces,

Her various fashions, and more various faces;

How had it posed that skill, which late assigned

Just appellations to each several kind!

A right idea of the sight to frame;

T'have guessed from what new element she came;

T'have hit the wav'ring form, or giv'n this thing a name.







To Death
 

O King of terrors, whose unbounded sway

All that have life must certainly obey;

The King, the Priest, the Prophet, all are thine,

Nor would ev'n God (in flesh) thy stroke decline.

My name is on thy roll, and sure I must

Increase thy gloomy kingdom in the dust.

My soul at this no apprehension feels,

But trembles at thy swords, thy racks, thy wheels;

Thy scorching fevers, which distract the sense,

And snatch us raving, unprepared, from hence;

At thy contagious darts, that wound the heads

Of weeping friends, who wait at dying beds.

Spare these, and let thy time be when it will;

My bus'ness is to die, and thine to kill.

Gently thy fatal scepter on me lay,

And take to thy cold arms, insensibly, thy prey.







Slicker
 

came in a pink, 
orange and white 
striped metal tube, 
with a black curlicue 
border and a splayed 
gold base.   It came 
in any number of 
mod shades: Nippy 
Beige, Chelsea Pink, 
Poppycock, Hot Nec- 
taringo, Pinkadilly, 
Dicey Peach.   There 
were several tubes in 
my mother's makeup 
drawer in the bath- 
room five out of six 
of us used (my father 
had his own bathroom, 
as forbidden as the 
walk-in closet where 
his Playboys were 
hidden under a stack 
of sweaters on the top 
shelf).   All the girls 
at school had Slicker 
in their purses; I 
watched them apply 
The London Look 
at the beginning and 
end of each class.   I 
marveled at what else 
spilled out: compact, 
mascara brush, eye 
shadow, wallet, troll 
doll, dyed rabbit's 
foot, chewing gum, 
tampon, pink plastic 
comb.   At home I 
stared at myself in 
the medicine cabinet 
mirror and, as my 
brother pounded 
on the locked bath- 
room door, twisted 
a tube and rubbed, 
ever so slightly, 
Slicker on my lips.

Veterans of the Seventies
 

His army jacket bore the white rectangle   
of one who has torn off his name.  He sat mute   
at the round table where the trip-wire veterans   
ate breakfast.  They were foxhole buddies   
who went stateside without leaving the war.   
They had the look of men who held their breath   
and now their tongues.  What is to say 
beyond that said by the fathers who bent lower   
and lower as the war went on, spines curving   
toward the ground on which sons sat sandbagged   
with ammo belts enough to make fine lace   
of enemy flesh and blood.  Now these who survived,    
who got back in cargo planes emptied at the front, 
lived hiddenly in the woods behind fence wires   
strung through tin cans.  Better an alarm   
than the constant nightmare of something moving   
on its belly to make your skin crawl   
with the sensory memory of foxhole living.





Friendship between Ephelia and Ardelia
 

Eph. What Friendship is, Ardelia show.

Ard. 'Tis to love, as I love you.

Eph. This account, so short (tho' kind)

       Suits not my inquiring mind.

       Therefore farther now repeat:

       What is Friendship when complete?

Ard. 'Tis to share all joy and grief;

       'Tis to lend all due relief

       From the tongue, the heart, the hand;

       'Tis to mortgage house and land;

       For a friend be sold a slave;

       'Tis to die upon a grave,

       If a friend therein do lie.

Eph. This indeed, tho' carried high,

       This, tho' more than e'er was done

       Underneath the rolling sun,

       This has all been said before.

       Can Ardelia say no more?

Ard. Words indeed no more can show:

       But 'tis to love, as I love you.





A Nocturnal Reverie
 

In such a night, when every louder wind

Is to its distant cavern safe confined;

And only gentle Zephyr fans his wings,

And lonely Philomel, still waking, sings;

Or from some tree, famed for the owl's delight,

She, hollowing clear, directs the wand'rer right:

In such a night, when passing clouds give place,

Or thinly veil the heav'ns' mysterious face;

When in some river, overhung with green,

The waving moon and the trembling leaves are seen;

When freshened grass now bears itself upright,

And makes cool banks to pleasing rest invite,

Whence springs the woodbind, and the bramble-rose,

And where the sleepy cowslip sheltered grows;

Whilst now a paler hue the foxglove takes,

Yet checkers still with red the dusky brakes

When scatter'd glow-worms, but in twilight fine,

Shew trivial beauties, watch their hour to shine;

Whilst Salisb'ry stands the test of every light,

In perfect charms, and perfect virtue bright:

When odors, which declined repelling day,

Through temp'rate air uninterrupted stray;

When darkened groves their softest shadows wear,

And falling waters we distinctly hear;

When through the gloom more venerable shows

Some ancient fabric, awful in repose,

While sunburnt hills their swarthy looks conceal,

And swelling haycocks thicken up the vale:

When the loosed horse now, as his pasture leads,

Comes slowly grazing through th' adjoining meads,

Whose stealing pace, and lengthened shade we fear,

Till torn-up forage in his teeth we hear:

When nibbling sheep at large pursue their food,

And unmolested kine rechew the cud;

When curlews cry beneath the village walls,

And to her straggling brood the partridge calls;

Their shortlived jubilee the creatures keep,

Which but endures, whilst tyrant man does sleep;

When a sedate content the spirit feels,

And no fierce light disturbs, whilst it reveals;

But silent musings urge the mind to seek

Something, too high for syllables to speak;

Till the free soul to a composedness charmed,

Finding the elements of rage disarmed,

O'er all below a solemn quiet grown,

Joys in th' inferior world, and thinks it like her own:

In such a night let me abroad remain,

Till morning breaks, and all's confused again;

Our cares, our toils, our clamors are renewed,

Or pleasures, seldom reached, again pursued.





On Myself
 

Good Heav'n, I thank thee, since it was designed

I should be framed, but of the weaker kind,

That yet, my Soul, is rescued from the love

Of all those trifles which their passions move.

Pleasures and praise and plenty have with me

But their just value. If allowed they be,

Freely, and thankfully as much I taste,

As will not reason or religion waste,

If they're denied, I on my self can live,

And slight those aids unequal chance does give.

When in the sun, my wings can be displayed,

And, in retirement, I can bless the shade.





A Fable
 

In Aesop's tales an honest wretch we find, 
Whose years and comforts equally declined; 
He in two wives had two domestic ills, 
For different age they had, and different wills; 
One plucked his black hairs out, and one his gray, 
The man for quietness did both obey, 
Till all his parish saw his head quite bare, 
And thought he wanted brains as well as hair. 

                        The Moral 

    The parties, henpecked William, are thy wives, 
The hairs they pluck are thy prerogatives; 
Tories thy person hate, the Whigs thy power, 
Though much thou yieldest, still they tug for more, 
Till this poor man and thou alike are shown, 
He without hair, and thou without a crown.





An Ode
 

The merchant, to secure his treasure,
   Conveys it in a borrowed name;
Euphelia serves to grace my measure,
   But Cloe is my real flame.

My softest verse, my darling lyre,
   Upon Euphelia's toilet lay;
When Cloe noted her desire
   That I should sing, that I should play.

My lyre I tune, my voice I raise,
   But with my numbers mix my sighs;
And whilst I sing Euphelia's praise,
   I fix my soul on Cloe's eyes.

Fair Cloe blushed; Euphelia frowned;
   I sung and gazed; I played and trembled;
And Venus to the Loves around
   Remarked how ill we all dissembled.





A Description of a City Shower
 

Careful observers may foretell the hour 
(By sure prognostics) when to dread a shower: 
While rain depends, the pensive cat gives o'er 
Her frolics, and pursues her tail no more. 
Returning home at night, you'll find the sink 
Strike your offended sense with double stink. 
If you be wise, then go not far to dine; 
You'll spend in coach hire more than save in wine. 
A coming shower your shooting corns presage, 
Old achs throb, your hollow tooth will rage. 
Sauntering in coffeehouse is Dulman seen; 
He damns the climate and complains of spleen. 
         Meanwhile the South, rising with dabbled wings, 
A sable cloud athwart the welkin flings, 
That swilled more liquor than it could contain, 
And, like a drunkard, gives it up again. 
Brisk Susan whips her linen from the rope, 
While the first drizzling shower is born aslope: 
Such is that sprinkling which some careless quean 
Flirts on you from her mop, but not so clean: 
You fly, invoke the gods; then turning, stop 
To rail; she singing, still whirls on her mop. 
Not yet the dust had shunned the unequal strife, 
But, aided by the wind, fought still for life, 
And wafted with its foe by violent gust, 
'Twas doubtful which was rain and which was dust. 
Ah! where must needy poet seek for aid, 
When dust and rain at once his coat invade? 
Sole coat, where dust cemented by the rain 
Erects the nap, and leaves a mingled stain. 
         Now in contiguous drops the flood comes down, 
Threatening with deluge this devoted town. 
To shops in crowds the daggled females fly, 
Pretend to cheapen goods, but nothing buy. 
The Templar spruce, while every spout's abroach, 
Stays till 'tis fair, yet seems to call a coach. 
The tucked-up sempstress walks with hasty strides, 
While seams run down her oiled umbrella's sides. 
Here various kinds, by various fortunes led, 
Commence acquaintance underneath a shed. 
Triumphant Tories and desponding Whigs 
Forget their feuds, and join to save their wigs. 
Boxed in a chair the beau impatient sits, 
While spouts run clattering o'er the roof by fits, 
And ever and anon with frightful din 
The leather sounds; he trembles from within. 
So when Troy chairmen bore the wooden steed, 
Pregnant with Greeks impatient to be freed 
(Those bully Greeks, who, as the moderns do, 
Instead of paying chairmen, run them through), 
Laocon struck the outside with his spear, 
And each imprisoned hero quaked for fear. 
         Now from all parts the swelling kennels flow, 
And bear their trophies with them as they go: 
Filth of all hues and odors seem to tell 
What street they sailed from, by their sight and smell. 
They, as each torrent drives with rapid force, 
From Smithfield or St. Pulchre's shape their course, 
And in huge confluence joined at Snow Hill ridge, 
Fall from the conduit prone to Holborn Bridge. 
Sweepings from butchers' stalls, dung, guts, and blood, 
Drowned puppies, stinking sprats, all drenched in mud, 
Dead cats, and turnip tops, come tumbling down the flood.





The Ladys Dressing Room
 

Five hours, (and who can do it less in?) 
By haughty Celia spent in dressing; 
The goddess from her chamber issues, 
Arrayed in lace, brocades and tissues. 
         Strephon, who found the room was void, 
And Betty otherwise employed, 
Stole in, and took a strict survey, 
Of all the litter as it lay; 
Whereof, to make the matter clear, 
And inventory follows here. 
         And first a dirty smock appeared, 
Beneath the armpits well besmeared. 
Strephon, the rogue, displayed it wide, 
And turned it round on every side. 
On such a point few words are best, 
And Strephon bids us guess the rest, 
But swears how damnably the men lie, 
In calling Celia sweet and cleanly. 
Now listen while he next produces 
The various combs for various uses, 
Filled up with dirt so closely fixt, 
No brush could force a way betwixt. 
A paste of composition rare, 
Sweat, dandruff, powder, lead and hair; 
A forehead cloth with oil upon't 
To smooth the wrinkles on her front; 
Here alum flower to stop the steams, 
Exhaled from sour unsavory streams, 
There night-gloves made of Tripsy's hide, 
Bequeathed by Tripsy when she died, 
With puppy water, beauty's help 
Distilled from Tripsy's darling whelp; 
Here gallypots and vials placed, 
Some filled with washes, some with paste, 
Some with pomatum, paints and slops, 
And ointments good for scabby chops. 
Hard by a filthy basin stands, 
Fouled with the scouring of her hands; 
The basin takes whatever comes 
The scrapings of her teeth and gums, 
A nasty compound of all hues, 
For here she spits, and here she spews. 
But oh! it turned poor Strephon's bowels, 
When he beheld and smelled the towels, 
Begummed, bemattered, and beslimed 
With dirt, and sweat, and earwax grimed. 
No object Strephon's eye escapes, 
Here petticoats in frowzy heaps; 
Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot 
All varnished o'er with snuff and snot. 
The stockings why should I expose, 
Stained with the marks of stinking toes; 
Or greasy coifs and pinners reeking, 
Which Celia slept at least a week in? 
A pair of tweezers next he found 
To pluck her brows in arches round, 
Or hairs that sink the forehead low, 
Or on her chin like bristles grow. 
         The virtues we must not let pass, 
Of Celia's magnifying glass. 
When frightened Strephon cast his eye on't 
It showed visage of a giant. 
A glass that can to sight disclose, 
The smallest worm in Celia's nose, 
And faithfully direct her nail 
To squeeze it out from head to tail; 
For catch it nicely by the head, 
It must come out alive or dead. 
         Why Strephon will you tell the rest? 
And must you needs describe the chest? 
That careless wench! no creature warn her 
To move it out from yonder corner; 
But leave it standing full in sight 
For you to exercise your spite. 
In vain the workman showed his wit 
With rings and hinges counterfeit 
To make it seem in this disguise 
A cabinet to vulgar eyes; 
For Strephon ventured to look in, 
Resolved to go through thick and thin; 
He lifts the lid, there needs no more, 
He smelled it all the time before. 
As from within Pandora's box, 
When Epimetheus op'd the locks, 
A sudden universal crew 
Of human evils upwards flew; 
He still was comforted to find 
That Hope at last remained behind; 
So Strephon lifting up the lid, 
To view what in the chest was hid. 
The vapors flew from out the vent, 
But Strephon cautious never meant 
The bottom of the pan to grope, 
And foul his hands in search of Hope. 
O never may such vile machine 
Be once in Celia's chamber seen! 
O may she better learn to keep 
Those "secrets of the hoary deep! 
         As mutton cutlets, prime of meat, 
Which though with art you salt and beat 
As laws of cookery require, 
And toast them at the clearest fire; 
If from adown the hopeful chops 
The fat upon a cinder drops, 
To stinking smoke it turns the flame 
Pois'ning the flesh from whence it came, 
And up exhales a greasy stench, 
For which you curse the careless wench; 
So things, which must not be expressed, 
When plumped into the reeking chest, 
Send up an excremental smell 
To taint the parts from whence they fell. 
The petticoats and gown perfume, 
Which waft a stink round every room. 
Thus finishing his grand survey, 
Disgusted Strephon stole away 
Repeating in his amorous fits, 
Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits! 
         But Vengeance, goddess never sleeping 
Soon punished Strephon for his peeping; 
His foul imagination links 
Each Dame he sees with all her stinks: 
And, if unsavory odors fly, 
Conceives a lady standing by: 
All women his description fits, 
And both ideas jump like wits: 
But vicious fancy coupled fast, 
And still appearing in contrast. 
I pity wretched Strephon blind 
To all the charms of female kind; 
Should I the queen of love refuse, 
Because she rose from stinking ooze? 
To him that looks behind the scene, 
Satira's but some pocky queen. 
When Celia in her glory shows, 
If Strephon would but stop his nose 
(Who now so impiously blasphemes 
Her ointments, daubs, and paints and creams, 
Her washes, slops, and every clout, 
With which he makes so foul a rout) 
He soon would learn to think like me, 
And bless his ravished sight to see 
Such order from confusion sprung, 
Such gaudy tulips raised from dung.





A Beautiful Young Nymph Going to Bed
 

Corinna, pride of Drury-Lane 
For whom no shepherd sighs in vain; 
Never did Covent Garden boast 
So bright a battered, strolling toast; 
No drunken rake to pick her up, 
No cellar where on tick to sup; 
Returning at the midnight hour; 
Four stories climbing to her bow'r; 
Then, seated on a three-legged chair, 
Takes off her artificial hair: 
Now, picking out a crystal eye, 
She wipes it clean, and lays it by. 
Her eye-brows from a mouse's hide, 
Stuck on with art on either side, 
Pulls off with care, and first displays 'em, 
Then in a play-book smoothly lays 'em. 
Now dexterously her plumpers draws, 
That serve to fill her hollow jaws. 
Untwists a wire; and from her gums 
A set of teeth completely comes. 
Pulls out the rags contrived to prop 
Her flabby dugs and down they drop. 
Proceeding on, the lovely goddess 
Unlaces next her steel-ribbed bodice; 
Which by the operator's skill, 
Press down the lumps, the hollows fill, 
Up goes her hand, and off she slips 
The bolsters that supply her hips. 
With gentlest touch, she next explores 
Her shankers, issues, running sores, 
Effects of many a sad disaster; 
And then to each applies a plaister. 
But must, before she goes to bed, 
Rub off the dawbs of white and red; 
And smooth the furrows in her front 
With greasy paper stuck upon't. 
She takes a bolus ere she sleeps; 
And then between two blankets creeps. 
With pains of love tormented lies; 
Or if she chance to close her eyes, 
Of Bridewell and the Compter dreams, 
And feels the lash, and faintly screams; 
Or, by a faithless bully drawn, 
At some hedge-tavern lies in pawn; 
Or to Jamaica seems transported, 
Alone, and by no planter courted; 
Or, near Fleet-Ditch's oozy brinks, 
Surrounded with a hundred stinks, 
Belated, seems on watch to lie, 
And snap some cully passing by; 
Or, struck with fear, her fancy runs 
On watchmen, constables and duns, 
From whom she meets with frequent rubs; 
But, never from religious clubs; 
Whose favor she is sure to find, 
Because she pays 'em all in kind. 
         Corinna wakes. A dreadful sight! 
Behold the ruins of the night! 
A wicked rat her plaster stole, 
Half eat, and dragged it to his hole. 
The crystal eye, alas, was missed; 
And puss had on her plumpers pissed. 
A pigeon picked her issue-peas; 
And Shock her tresses filled with fleas. 
         The nymph, tho' in this mangled plight, 
Must ev'ry morn her limbs unite. 
But how shall I describe her arts 
To recollect the scattered parts? 
Or shew the anguish, toil, and pain, 
Of gath'ring up herself again? 
The bashful muse will never bear 
In such a scene to interfere. 
Corinna in the morning dizened, 
Who sees, will spew; who smells, be poison'd.





The Day of Judgment
 

An Ode Attempted in English Sapphic
When the fierce north wind with his airy forces 
Rears up the Baltic to a foaming fury, 
And the red lightning with a storm of hail comes 
                               Rushing amain down, 

How the poor sailors stand amazed and tremble, 
While the hoarse thunder, like a bloody trumpet, 
Roars a loud onset to the gaping waters, 
                               Quick to devour them! 

Such shall the noise be and the wild disorder, 
(If things eternal may be like these earthly) 
Such the dire terror, when the great Archangel 
                               Shakes the creation, 

Tears the strong pillars of the vault of heaven, 
Breaks up old marble, the repose of princes; 
See the graves open, and the bones arising, 
                               Flames all around 'em! 

Hark, the shrill outcries of the guilty wretches! 
Lively bright horror and amazing anguish 
Stare through their eyelids, while the living worm lies 
                               Gnawing within them. 

Thoughts like old vultures prey upon their heart-strings, 
And the smart twinges, when the eye beholds the 
Lofty Judge frowning, and a flood of vengeance 
                               Rolling afore him. 

Hopeless immortals! how they scream and shiver, 
While devils push them to the pit wide-yawning 
Hideous and gloomy, to receive them headlong 
                           Down to the center. 

Stop here, my fancy: (all away ye horrid 
Doleful ideas); come, arise to Jesus; 
How He sits God-like! and the saints around him 
                               Throned, yet adoring! 

Oh may I sit there when he comes triumphant 
Dooming the nations! then ascend to glory 
While our hosannas all along the passage 
                               Shout the Redeemer.





A Prospect of Heaven Makes Death Easy
 

There is a land of pure delight 
   Where saints immortal reign; 
Infinite day excludes the night, 
   And pleasures banish pain. 

There everlasting spring abides, 
   And never-withering flowers; 
Death like a narrow sea divides 
   This heavenly land from ours. 

Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood 
   Stand dressed in living green: 
So to the Jews old Canaan stood, 
   While Jordan rolled between. 

But timorous mortals start and shrink 
   To cross this narrow sea, 
And linger shivering on the brink, 
   And fear to launch away. 

Oh could we make our doubts remove, 
   These gloomy doubts that rise, 
And see the Canaan that we love, 
   With unbeclouded eyes; 

Could we but climb where Moses stood 
   And view the landscape o'er, 
Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood, 
   Should fright us from the shore.





Our God, Our Help
 

Our God, our help in ages past, 
   Our hope for years to come, 
Our shelter from the stormy blast, 
   And our eternal home: 

Under the shadow of thy throne 
   Thy saints have dwelt secure; 
Sufficient is thine arm alone, 
   And our defense is sure. 

Before the hills in order stood 
   Or earth received her frame, 
From everlasting thou art God, 
   To endless years the same. 

Thy word commands our flesh to dust, 
   "Return, ye sons of men; 
All nations rose from earth at first, 
   And turn to earth again. 

A thousand ages in thy sight 
   Are like an evening gone; 
Short as the watch that ends the night 
   Before the rising sun. 

The busy tribes of flesh and blood, 
   With all their lives and cares, 
Are carried downwards by thy flood, 
   And lost in following years. 

Time, like an ever-rolling stream, 
   Bears all its sons away; 
They fly forgotten, as a dream 
   Dies at the opening day. 

Like flowery fields the nations stand, 
   Pleased with the morning light; 
The flowers beneath the mower's hand 
   Lie withering e'er 'tis night. 

Our God, our help in ages past, 
   Our hope for years to come, 
Be thou our guard while troubles last, 
   And our eternal home.





Psalm 58
 

Warning to Magistrates
Judges, who rule the world by laws, 
Will ye despise the righteous cause, 
   When th'injur'd poor before you stands? 
Dare ye condemn the righteous poor, 
And let rich sinners 'scape secure, 
   While gold and greatness bribe your hands? 

Have ye forgot or never knew 
That God will judge the judges too? 
   High in the Heavens his justice reigns; 
Yet you invade the rights of God, 
And send your bold decrees abroad 
   To bind the conscience in your chains. 

A poisoned arrow is your tongue, 
The arrow sharp, the poison strong, 
   And death attends where e'er it wounds: 
You hear no counsels, cries or tears; 
So the deaf adder stops her ears 
   Against the power of charming sounds. 

Break out their teeth, eternal God, 
Those teeth of lions dyed in blood; 
   And crush the serpents in the dust: 
As empty chaff, when whirlwinds rise, 
Before the sweeping tempest flies, 
   So let their hopes and names be lost. 

Th'Almighty thunders from the sky, 
Their grandeur melts, their titles die, 
   As hills of snow dissolve and run, 
Or snails that perish in their slime, 
Or births that come before their time, 
   Vain births, that never see the sun. 

Thus shall the vengeance of the Lord 
Safety and joy to saints afford; 
   And all that hear shall join and say, 
"Sure there's a God that rules on high, 
"A God that hears his children cry, 
   "And will their sufferings well repay.





Separation
 

Your absence has gone through me   
Like thread through a needle. 
Everything I do is stitched with its color.





Psalm 114
 

Miracles Attending Israel's Journey
When Isr'el, freed from Pharaoh's hand, 
Left the proud tyrant and his land, 
The tribes with cheerful homage own 
Their king; and Judah was his throne. 

Across the deep their journey lay; 
The deep divides to make them way. 
Jordan beheld their march, and led, 
With backward current, to his head. 

The mountains shook like frighted sheep, 
Like lambs the little hillocks leap; 
Not Sinai on her base could stand, 
Conscious of sov'reign pow'r at hand. 

What pow'r could make the deep divide? 
Make Jordan backward roll his tide? 
Why did ye leap, ye little hills? 
And whence the fright that Sinai feels? 

Let ev'ry mountain, ev'ry flood, 
Retire and know th' approaching God, 
The King of Isr'el: see him here! 
Tremble, thou earth, adore and fear. 

He thunders, and all nature mourns; 
The rock to standing pools he turns, 
Flints spring with fountains at his word, 
And fires and seas confess the Lord.





The Universal Prayer
 

Father of all! in every age, 
    In every clime adored, 
By saint, by savage, and by sage, 
    Jehovah, Jove, or Lord! 

Thou Great First Cause, least understood: 
    Who all my sense confined 
To know but this--that thou art good, 
    And that myself am blind: 

Yet gave me, in this dark estate, 
    To see the good from ill; 
And binding Nature fast in fate, 
    Left free the human will. 

What conscience dictates to be done, 
    Or warns me not to do, 
This, teach me more than Hell to shun, 
    That, more than Heaven pursue. 

What blessings thy free bounty gives, 
    Let me not cast away; 
For God is paid when man receives, 
    To enjoy is to obey. 

Yet not to earth's contracted span, 
    Thy goodness let me bound, 
Or think thee Lord alone of man, 
    When thousand worlds are round: 

Let not this weak, unknowing hand 
    Presume thy bolts to throw, 
And deal damnation round the land, 
    On each I judge thy foe. 

If I am right, thy grace impart, 
    Still in the right to stay; 
If I am wrong, oh teach my heart 
    To find a better way. 

Save me alike from foolish pride, 
    Or impious discontent, 
At aught thy wisdom has denied, 
    Or aught thy goodness lent. 

Teach me to feel another's woe, 
    To hide the fault I see; 
That mercy I to others show, 
    That mercy show to me. 

Mean though I am, not wholly so 
    Since quickened by thy breath; 
Oh lead me wheresoe'er I go, 
    Through this day's life or death. 

This day, be bread and peace my lot: 
    All else beneath the sun, 
Thou know'st if best bestowed or not, 
    And let thy will be done. 

To thee, whose temple is all space, 
    Whose altar, earth, sea, skies! 
One chorus let all being raise! 
    All Nature's incense rise!





Impromptu
 

To Lady Winchelsea, Occasioned by four Satirical Verses on Women Wits,  In The Rape of the Lock 
In vain you boast poetic names of yore, 
And cite those Sapphos we admire no more: 
Fate doomed the fall of every female wit; 
But doomed it then, when first Ardelia writ. 
Of all examples by the world confessed, 
I knew Ardelia could not quote the best; 
Who, like her mistress on Britannia's throne, 
Fights and subdues in quarrels not her own. 
To write their praise you but in vain essay; 
Even while you write, you take that praise away. 
Light to the stars the sun does thus restore, 
But shines himself till they are seen no more. 






Epistle from Mrs. Yonge to Her Husband
 

Think not this paper comes with vain pretense
To move your pity, or to mourn th' offense.
Too well I know that hard obdurate heart;
No softening mercy there will take my part,
Nor can a woman's arguments prevail,
When even your patron's wise example fails.
But this last privilege I still retain;
Th' oppressed and injured always may complain.
    Too, too severely laws of honor bind
The weak submissive sex of womankind.
If sighs have gained or force compelled our hand,
Deceived by art, or urged by stern command,
Whatever motive binds the fatal tie,
The judging world expects our constancy.
    Just heaven! (for sure in heaven does justice reign,
Though tricks below that sacred name profane)
To you appealing I submit my cause.
Nor fear a judgment from impartial laws.
All bargains but conditional are made;
The purchase void, the creditor unpaid;
Defrauded servants are from service free;
A wounded slave regains his liberty.
For wives ill used no remedy remains,
To daily racks condemned, and to eternal chains.
    From whence is this unjust distinction grown?
Are we not formed with passions like your own?
Nature with equal fire our souls endued,
Our minds as haughty, and as warm our blood;
O'er the wide world your pleasures you pursue,
The change is justified by something new;
But we must sigh in silence--and be true.
Our sex's weakness you expose and blame
(Of every prattling fop the common theme),
Yet from this weakness you suppose is due
Sublimer virtue than your Cato knew.
Had heaven designed us trials so severe,
It would have formed our tempers then to bear.
    And I have borne (oh what have I not borne!)
The pang of jealousy, the insults of scorn.
Wearied at length, I from your sight remove,
And place my future hopes in secret love.
In the gay bloom of glowing youth retired,
I quit the woman's joy to be admired,
With that small pension your hard heart allows,
Renounce your fortune, and release your vows.
To custom (though unjust) so much is due;
I hide my frailty from the public view.
My conscience clear, yet sensible of shame,
My life I hazard, to preserve my fame.
And I prefer this low inglorious state
To vile dependence on the thing I hate--
But you pursue me to this last retreat.
Dragged into light, my tender crime is shown
And every circumstance of fondness known.
Beneath the shelter of the law you stand,
And urge my ruin with a cruel hand,
While to my fault thus rigidly severe,
Tamely submissive to the man you fear.
    This wretched outcast, this abandoned wife,
Has yet this joy to sweeten shameful life:
By your mean conduct, infamously loose,
You are at once my accuser and excuse.
Let me be damned by the censorious prude
(Stupidly dull, or spiritually lewd),
My hapless case will surely pity find
From every just and reasonable mind.
When to the final sentence I submit,
The lips condemn me, but their souls aquit.
    No more my husband, to your pleasures go,
The sweets of your recovered freedom know.
Go: court the brittle friendship of the great,
Smile at his board, or at his levee wait;
And when dismissed, to madam's toilet fly,
More than her chambermaids, or glasses, lie,
Tell her how young she looks, how heavenly fair,
Admire the lilies and the roses there.
Your high ambition may be gratified,
Some cousin of her own be made your bride,
And you the father of a glorious race
Endowed with Ch----l's strength and Low----r's face.





HYMNS: My God! I Know, I Feel Thee Mine
 

1 
My God! I know, I feel thee mine, 
   And will not quit my claim 
Till all I have is lost in thine, 
   And all renewed I am. 

                        2 
I hold thee with a trembling hand, 
   But will not let thee go 
Till steadfastly by faith I stand, 
   And all thy goodness know. 

                        3 
When shall I see the welcome hour 
   That plants my God in me! 
Spirit of health, and life, and power, 
   And perfect liberty! 

                        4 
Jesu, thine all-victorious love 
   Shed in my heart abroad! 
Then shall my feet no longer rove, 
   Rooted and fixed in God. 

                        5 
Love only can the conquest win, 
   The strength of sin subdue 
(Mine own unconquerable sin), 
   And form my soul anew. 

                        6 
Love can bow down the stubborn neck, 
   The stone to flesh convert; 
Soften, and melt, and pierce, and break 
   An adamantine heart. 

                        7 
Oh, that in me the sacred fire 
   Might now begin to glow, 
Burn up the dross of base desire, 
   And make the mountains flow! 

                        8 
Oh, that it now from heaven might fall, 
   And all my sins consume! 
Come, Holy Ghost, for thee I call, 
   Spirit of burning, come! 

                        9 
Refining fire, go through my heart, 
   Illuminate my soul; 
Scatter thy life through every part, 
   And sanctify the whole. 

                        10 
Sorrow and sin shall then expire, 
   While, entered into rest, 
I only live my God t'admire-- 
   My God forever blest. 

                        11 
No longer then my heart shall mourn, 
   While purified by grace 
I only for his glory burn, 
   And always see his face. 

                        12 
My steadfast soul, from falling free, 
   Shall then no longer move; 
But Christ be all the world to me, 
   And all my heart be love.





HYMNS: Come on, My Partners in Distress
 

1 
Come on, my partners in distress, 
My comrades through the wilderness, 
   Who still your bodies feel; 
Awhile forget your griefs and fears, 
And look beyond this vale of tears 
   To that celestial hill. 

                              2 
Beyond the bounds of time and space 
Look forward to that heavenly place, 
   The saints' secure abode; 
On faith's strong eagle pinions rise, 
And force your passage to the skies, 
   And scale the mount of God. 

                              3 
Who suffer with our Master here, 
We shall before his face appear, 
   And by his side sit down; 
To patient faith the prize is sure, 
And all that to the end endure 
   The cross, shall wear the crown. 

                              4 
Thrice blessed bliss-inspiring hope! 
It lifts the fainting spirits up, 
   It brings to life the dead; 
Our conflicts here shall soon be past, 
And you and I ascend at last 
   Triumphant with our head. 

                              5 
The great mysterious Deity 
We soon with open face shall see; 
   The beatific sight 
Shall fill heaven's sounding courts with praise, 
And wide diffuse the golden blaze 
   Of everlasting light. 

                              6 
The Father shining on his throne, 
The glorious, co-eternal Son, 
   The Spirit, one and seven, 
Conspire our rapture to complete, 
And lo! we fall before his feet, 
   And silence heightens heaven. 

                              7 
In hope of that ecstatic pause, 
Jesu, we now sustain the cross, 
   And at thy footstool fall, 
Till thou our hidden life reveal, 
Till thou our ravished spirits fill, 
   And God is all in all.





On the Death of Dr. Robert Levet
 

Condemned to Hope's delusive mine, 
    As on we toil from day to day, 
By sudden blasts, or slow decline, 
    Our social comforts drop away. 

Well tried through many a varying year, 
    See Levet to the grave descend; 
Officious, innocent, sincere, 
    Of every friendless name the friend. 

Yet still he fills Affection's eye, 
    Obscurely wise, and coarsely kind; 
Nor, lettered Arrogance, deny 
    Thy praise to merit unrefined. 

When fainting Nature called for aid, 
    And hovering Death prepared the blow, 
His vigorous remedy displayed 
    The power of art without the show. 

In Misery's darkest cavern known, 
    His useful care was ever nigh, 
Where hopeless Anguish poured his groan, 
    And lonely Want retired to die. 

No summons mocked by chill delay, 
    No petty gain disdained by pride, 
The modest wants of every day 
    The toil of every day supplied. 

His virtues walked their narrow round, 
    Nor made a pause, nor left a void; 
And sure the Eternal Master found 
    The single talent well employed. 

The busy day, the peaceful night, 
    Unfelt, uncounted, glided by; 
His frame was firm, his powers were bright, 
    Though now his eightieth year was nigh. 

Then with no throbbing fiery pain, 
    No cold gradations of decay, 
Death broke at once the vital chain, 
    And freed his soul the nearest way.





Psalm 58
 

Ye congregation of the tribes, 
    On justice do you set your mind; 
And are ye free from guile and bribes 
   Ye judges of mankind? 

Nay, ye of frail and mortal mould 
   Imagine mischief in your heart; 
Your suffrages and selves are sold 
   Unto the general mart. 

Men of unrighteous seed betray 
   Perverseness from their mother's womb; 
As soon as they can run astray, 
   Against the truth presume. 

They are with foul infection stained, 
   Ev'n with the serpent's taint impure; 
Their ears to blest persuasion chained, 
   And locked against her lure. 

Though Christ himself the pipe should tune, 
   They will not to the measure tread, 
Nor will they with his grief commune 
   Though tears of blood he shed. 

Lord, humanize their scoff and scorn, 
   And their malevolence defeat; 
Of water and the spirit born 
   Let grace their change complete. 

Let them with pious ardor burn, 
   And make thy holy church their choice; 
To thee with all their passions turn, 
   And in thy light rejoice. 

As quick as lightning to its mark, 
   So let thy gracious angel speed; 
And take their spirits in thine ark 
   To their eternal mead. 

The righteous shall exult the more 
   As he such powerful mercy sees, 
Such wrecks and ruins safe on shore, 
   Such tortured souls at ease. 

So that a man shall say, no doubt, 
   The penitent has his reward; 
There is a God to bear him out, 
   And he is Christ our Lord.





Psalm 114
 

When Israel came from Egypt's coast, 
   And Goshen's marshy plains, 
And Jacob with his joyful host 
   From servitude and chains; 

Then was it seen how much the Jews 
   Were holy in his sight, 
And God did Israel's kingdom choose 
   To manifest his might. 

The sea beheld it, and with dread 
   Retreated to make way; 
And Jordan to his fountain head 
   Ran backwards in dismay. 

The mountains, like the rams that bound, 
   Exulted on their base; 
Like lambs the little hills around 
   Skipt lightly from their place. 

What is the cause, thou mighty sea, 
   That thou thyself should shun; 
And Jordan, what is come to thee, 
   That thou should backward run? 

Ye mountains that ye leaped so high 
   From off the solid rock, 
Ye hills that ye should gambols try, 
   Like firstlings of the flock? 

Earth, from the center to the sod 
   His fearful presence hail 
The presence of Jeshurun's God, 
   In whom our arms prevail. 

Who beds of rocks in pools to stand 
   Can by his word compel, 
And from the veiny flint command 
   The fountain and the well.





Epitaph on a Hare
 

Here lies, whom hound did ne'er pursue, 
    Nor swifter greyhound follow, 
Whose foot ne'er tainted morning dew, 
    Nor ear heard huntsman's hallo', 

Old Tiney, surliest of his kind, 
    Who, nursed with tender care, 
And to domesticate bounds confined, 
    Was still a wild jack-hare. 

Though duly from my hand he took 
    His pittance every night, 
He did it with a jealous look, 
    And, when he could, would bite. 

His diet was of wheaten bread, 
    And milk, and oats, and straw, 
Thistles, or lettuces instead, 
    With sand to scour his maw. 

On twigs of hawthorn he regaled, 
    On pippins' russet peel; 
And, when his juicy salads failed, 
    Sliced carrot pleased him well. 

A Turkey carpet was his lawn, 
    Whereon he loved to bound, 
To skip and gambol like a fawn, 
    And swing his rump around. 

His frisking was at evening hours, 
    For then he lost his fear; 
But most before approaching showers, 
    Or when a storm drew near. 

Eight years and five round-rolling moons 
    He thus saw steal away, 
Dozing out all his idle noons, 
    And every night at play. 

I kept him for his humor's sake, 
    For he would oft beguile 
My heart of thoughts that made it ache, 
    And force me to a smile. 

But now, beneath this walnut-shade 
    He finds his long, last home, 
And waits in snug concealment laid, 
    Till gentler Puss shall come. 

He, still more agd, feels the shocks 
    From which no care can save, 
And, partner once of Tiney's box, 
    Must soon partake his grave.





Hatred and Vengeance, My Eternal Portion
 

Hatred and vengeance, my eternal portion,
Scarce can endure delay of execution,
Wait, with impatient readiness, to seize my
                           Soul in a moment.

Damned below Judas: more abhorred than he was,
Who for a few pence sold his holy master.
Twice betrayed, Jesus me, the last delinquent,
                           Deems the profanest.

Man disavows, and Delty disowns me:
Hell might afford my miseries a shelter;
Therefore hell keeps her ever-hungry mouths all
                           Bolted against me.
Hard lot! encompassed with a thousand dangers;

Weary, faint, trembling with a thousand terrors,
I'm called, if vanquished, to receive a sentence
                           Worse than Abiram's.

Him the vindictive rod of angry justice
Sent quick and howling to the centre headlong;
I, fed with judgment, in a fleshly tomb, am
                           Buried above ground.






The Rose
 

a labyrinth, 
as if at its center, 
god would be there-- 
but at the center, only rose, 
where rose came from,   
where rose grows-- 
& us, inside of the lips & lips: 
the likenesses, the eyes, & the hair, 
we are born of, 
fed by, & marry with, 
only flesh itself, only its passage 
--out of where?    to where? 

Then god the mother said to Jim, in a dream, 
Never mind you, Jim, 
come rest again on the country porch of my knees.





Crepuscule with Muriel
 

Instead of a cup of tea, instead of a milk- 
silk whelk of a cup, of a cup of nearly six 
o'clock teatime, cup of a stumbling block, 
cup of an afternoon unredeemed by talk, 
cup of a cut brown loaf, of a slice, a lack 
of butter, blueberry jam that's almost black, 
instead of tannin seeping into the cracks 
of a pot, the void of an hour seeps out, infects 
the slit of a cut I haven't the wit to fix 
with a surgeon's needle threaded with fine-gauge silk 
as a key would thread the cylinder of a lock. 
But no key threads the cylinder of a lock. 
Late afternoon light, transitory, licks 
the place of the absent cup with its rough tongue, flicks 
itself out beneath the wheel's revolving spoke. 
Taut thought's gone, with a blink of attention, slack, 
a vision of "death and distance in the mix" 
(she lost her words and how did she get them back 
when the corridor of a day was a lurching deck? 
The dream-life logic encodes in nervous tics 
she translated to a syntax which connects 
intense and unfashionable politics 
with morning coffee, Hudson sunsets, sex; 
then the short-circuit of the final stroke, 
the end toward which all lines looped out, then broke). 
What a gaze out the window interjects: 
on the southeast corner, a black Lab balks, 
tugged as the light clicks green toward a late-day walk 
by a plump brown girl in a purple anorak. 
The Bronx-bound local comes rumbling up the tracks 
out of the tunnel, over west Harlem blocks 
whose windows gleam on the animal warmth of bricks 
rouged by the fluvial light of six o'clock.





After Su Tung P'o
 

ON THE BIRTH OF A SON
When a child is born, the parents say 
they hope it's healthy and intelligent. But as for me-- 

well, vigor and intelligence have wrecked my life. I pray 
this baby we are seeing walloped, wiped and winningly anointed, 

turns out dumb as oakum--and more sinister. That way 
he can crown a tranquil life by being 

appointed a cabinet minister.





What He Thought
 

for Fabbio Doplicher
We were supposed to do a job in Italy 
and, full of our feeling for 
ourselves (our sense of being 
Poets from America) we went 
from Rome to Fano, met 
the mayor, mulled 
a couple matters over (what's 
a cheap date, they asked us; what's 
flat drink). Among Italian literati 

we could recognize our counterparts: 
the academic, the apologist, 
the arrogant, the amorous, 
the brazen and the glib--and there was one 

administrator (the conservative), in suit 
of regulation gray, who like a good tour guide 
with measured pace and uninflected tone narrated 
sights and histories the hired van hauled us past. 
Of all, he was the most politic and least poetic, 
so it seemed. Our last few days in Rome 
(when all but three of the New World Bards had flown) 
I found a book of poems this 
unprepossessing one had written: it was there 
in the pensione room (a room he'd recommended) 
where it must have been abandoned by 
the German visitor (was there a bus of them?) 
to whom he had inscribed and dated it a month before. 
I couldn't read Italian, either, so I put the book 
back into the wardrobe's dark. We last Americans 

were due to leave tomorrow. For our parting evening then 
our host chose something in a family restaurant, and there 
we sat and chatted, sat and chewed, 
till, sensible it was our last 
big chance to be poetic, make 
our mark, one of us asked 
                                             "What's poetry?" 
Is it the fruits and vegetables and 
marketplace of Campo dei Fiori, or 
the statue there?" Because I was 

the glib one, I identified the answer 
instantly, I didn't have to think--"The truth 
is both, it's both," I blurted out. But that 
was easy. That was easiest to say. What followed 
taught me something about difficulty, 
for our underestimated host spoke out, 
all of a sudden, with a rising passion, and he said: 

The statue represents Giordano Bruno, 
brought to be burned in the public square 
because of his offense against 
authority, which is to say 
the Church. His crime was his belief 
the universe does not revolve around 
the human being: God is no 
fixed point or central government, but rather is 
poured in waves through all things. All things 
move. "If God is not the soul itself, He is 
the soul of the soul of the world." Such was 
his heresy. The day they brought him 
forth to die, they feared he might 
incite the crowd (the man was famous 
for his eloquence). And so his captors 
placed upon his face 
an iron mask, in which 

he could not speak. That's 
how they burned him. That is how 
he died: without a word, in front 
of everyone. 
                     And poetry-- 
                                        (we'd all 
put down our forks by now, to listen to 
the man in gray; he went on 
softly)-- 
                  poetry is what 

he thought, but did not say.





Sonnets from the Portuguese 38: First time he kissed me, he but only kissed
 

First time he kissed me, he but only kissed 
The fingers of this hand wherewith I write, 
And ever since it grew more clean and white,... 
Slow to world-greetings...quick with its "Oh, list, 
When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst 
I could not wear here plainer to my sight, 
Than that first kiss. The second passed in height 
The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed, 
Half falling on the hair. O beyond meed! 
That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown, 
With sanctifying sweetness, did precede. 
The third, upon my lips, was folded down 
In perfect, purple state! since when, indeed, 
I have been proud and said, "My Love, my own.





Turtle
 

Who would be a turtle who could help it? 
A barely mobile hard roll, a four-oared helmet, 
she can ill afford the chances she must take 
in rowing toward the grasses that she eats. 
Her track is graceless, like dragging 
a packing-case places, and almost any slope 
defeats her modest hopes. Even being practical, 
she's often stuck up to the axle on her way 
to something edible. With everything optimal, 
she skirts the ditch which would convert 
her shell into a serving dish. She lives 
below luck-level, never imagining some lottery 
will change her load of pottery to wings. 
Her only levity is patience, 
the sport of truly chastened things.





Paired Things
 

Who, who had only seen wings, 
could extrapolate the 
skinny sticks of things 
birds use for land, 
the backward way they bend, 
the silly way they stand? 
And who, only studying 
birdtracks in the sand, 
could think those little forks 
had decamped on the wind? 
So many paired things seem odd. 
Who ever would have dreamed 
the broad winged raven of despair 
would quit the air and go 
bandylegged upon the ground, 
a common crow?





Sitting Outside at the End of Autumn
 

Three years ago, in the afternoons, 
                                            I used to sit back here and try 
To answer the simple arithmetic of my life, 
But never could figure it-- 
This object and that object 
Never contained the landscape 
                                                          nor all of its implications, 
This tree and that shrub 
Never completely satisfied the sum or quotient 
I took from or carried to, 
                                               nor do they do so now, 
Though I'm back here again, looking to calculate, 
Looking to see what adds up. 

Everything comes from something, 
                                           only something comes from nothing, 
Lao Tzu says, more or less. 
Eminently sensible, I say, 
Rubbing this tiny snail shell between my thumb and two fingers. 
Delicate as an earring, 
                                          it carries its emptiness like a child 
It would be rid of. 
I rub it clockwise and counterclockwise, hoping for anything 
Resplendent in its vocabulary or disguise-- 
But one and one make nothing, he adds, 
                                                                           endless and everywhere, 
The shadow that everything casts.





Lyre
 

Before anything could happen, 
flecks of real gold 
on her mouth, her eyes more 
convex than any others, 
the ground spoke, the barrier 
of lilacs spoke. What sang 
in the black tree was entirely gold. 
Her chair was empty. 

New absence is a great figure 
dark as the underskin of fruit. 
At the center of the earth 
it surrounds and amplifies the dead 
whose music never slows down. 

She came by car. I came by train. 
We embraced. It was 
at the foot of a hill steeply 
crowned with apples 
and a ruined fortress. 
Imagination did not make the world. 

Sweetness is the entire portion. 
Before anything could happen, 
happiness, the necessary 
precondition of the world, 
spoke and flowered over the hill. 

When I was in Hell 
on the ruined palisade, 
either mystery or loneliness 
kissed my open eyes. 

It felt hugely convex, seeing 
and immediately forgetting. 

By contrast, what I imagined 
later was nothing.





Stilling
 

The last snow is baited. 
Where the future shatters 
it unbends. 
The dry bed of entirety, 
where the sun bends, 
shatters. 

I was not afraid to tell you: 
unobscene 
at the first and then 
the third horizon, 
a copse-mountain 
opened so near to me 
I weighed nothing, 
and you laid the flower in my mouth. 

These are not animals. 
These are the partial genocides 
deeply uncompensated. 
Under the grass 
there is nothing but water 
and two wings.





The Bells of San Blas
 

What say the Bells of San Blas 
To the ships that southward pass 
       From the harbor of Mazatlan? 
To them it is nothing more 
Than the sound of surf on the shore,-- 
       Nothing more to master or man. 

But to me, a dreamer of dreams, 
To whom what is and what seems 
       Are often one and the same,-- 
The Bells of San Blas to me 
Have a strange, wild melody, 
       And are something more than a name. 

For bells are the voice of the church; 
They have tones that touch and search 
       The hearts of young and old; 
One sound to all, yet each 
Lends a meaning to their speech, 
       And the meaning is manifold. 

They are a voice of the Past, 
Of an age that is fading fast, 
       Of a power austere and grand; 
When the flag of Spain unfurled 
Its folds o'er this western world, 
       And the Priest was lord of the land. 

The chapel that once looked down 
On the little seaport town 
       Has crumbled into the dust; 
And on oaken beams below 
The bells swing to and fro, 
       And are green with mould and rust. 

"Is, then, the old faith dead," 
They say, "and in its stead 
       Is some new faith proclaimed, 
That we are forced to remain 
Naked to sun and rain, 
       Unsheltered and ashamed? 

"Once in our tower aloof 
We rang over wall and roof 
       Our warnings and our complaints; 
And round about us there 
The white doves filled the air, 
       Like the white souls of the saints. 

"The saints! Ah, have they grown 
Forgetful of their own? 
       Are they asleep, or dead, 
That open to the sky 
Their ruined Missions lie, 
       No longer tenanted? 

"Oh, bring us back once more 
The vanished days of yore, 
       When the world with faith was filled; 
Bring back the fervid zeal, 
The hearts of fire and steel, 
       The hands that believe and build. 

"Then from our tower again 
We will send over land and main 
       Our voices of command, 
Like exiled kings who return 
To their thrones, and the people learn 
       That the Priest is lord of the land!" 

O Bells of San Blas, in vain 
Ye call back the Past again! 
       The Past is deaf to your prayer; 
Out of the shadows of night 
The world rolls into light; 
       It is daybreak everywhere.





Mezzo Cammin
 

Half of my life is gone, and I have let 
   The years slip from me and have not fulfilled 
   The aspiration of my youth, to build 
   Some tower of song with lofty parapet. 
Not indolence, nor pleasure, nor the fret 
   Of restless passions that would not be stilled, 
   But sorrow, and a care that almost killed, 
   Kept me from what I may accomplish yet; 
Though, half-way up the hill, I see the Past 
   Lying beneath me with its sounds and sights,-- 
   A city in the twilight dim and vast, 
With smoking roofs, soft bells, and gleaming lights,-- 
   And hear above me on the autumnal blast 
   The cataract of Death far thundering from the heights.





Hot Sun, Cool Fire
 

Hot sun, cool fire, tempered with sweet air, 
Black shade, fair nurse, shadow my white hair. 
Shine, sun; burn, fire; breathe, air, and ease me; 
Black shade, fair nurse, shroud me and please me. 
Shadow, my sweet nurse, keep me from burning; 
Make not my glad cause cause of mourning. 
    Let not my beauty's fire 
    Inflame unstaid desire, 
    Nor pierce any bright eye 
    That wandereth lightly. 






Rosalinds Madrigal
 

Love in my bosom like a bee
    Doth suck his sweet;
Now with his wings he plays with me,
    Now with his feet.
Within mine eyes he makes his nest,
His bed amidst my tender breast;
My kisses are his daily feast,
And yet he robs me of my rest.
    Ah, wanton, will ye?

And if I sleep, then percheth he
    With pretty flight,
And makes his pillow of my knee
    The livelong night.
Strike I my lute, he tunes the string;
He music plays if so I sing;
He lends me every lovely thing;
Yet cruel he my heart doth sting.
    Whist, wanton, still ye!

Else I with roses every day
    Will whip you hence,
And bind you, when you long to play,
    For your offense.
I'll shut mine eyes to keep you in,
I'll make you fast it for your sin,
I'll count your power not worth a pin.
Alas! what hereby shall I win
    If he gainsay me?

What if I beat the wanton boy
    With many a rod?
He will repay me with annoy,
    Because a god.
Then sit thou safely on my knee,
And let thy bower my bosom be;
Lurk in mine eyes, I like of thee.
O Cupid, so thou pity me,
    Spare not, but play thee!





New Heaven, New War
 

Come to your heaven, you heavenly choirs, 
Earth hath the heaven of your desires. 
Remove your dwelling to your God; 
A stall is now his best abode. 
Sith men their homage do deny, 
Come, angels, all their fault supply. 

His chilling cold doth heat require; 
Come, seraphins, in lieu of fire. 
This little ark no cover hath; 
Let cherubs' wings his body swathe. 
Come, Raphael, this babe must eat; 
Provide our little Toby meat. 

Let Gabriel be now his groom, 
That first took up his earthly room. 
Let Michael stand in his defense, 
Whom love hath linked to feeble sense. 
Let graces rock when he doth cry, 
And angels sing his lullaby. 

The same you saw in heavenly seat 
Is he that now sucks Mary's teat; 
Agnize your king a mortal wight, 
His borrowed weed lets not your sight. 
Come, kiss the manger where he lies, 
That is your bliss above the skies. 

This little babe, so few days old, 
Is come to rifle Satan's fold; 
All hell doth at his presence quake. 
Though he himself for cold do shake, 
For in this weak unarmd wise 
The gates of hell he will surprise. 

With tears he fights and wins the field; 
His naked breast stands for a shield; 
His battering shot are babish cries, 
His arrows looks of weeping eyes, 
His martial ensigns cold and need, 
And feeble flesh his warrior's steed. 

His camp is pitchd in a stall, 
His bulwark but a broken wall, 
The crib his trench, hay stalks his stakes, 
Of shepherds he his muster makes; 
And thus, as sure his foe to wound, 
The angels' trumps alarum sound. 

My soul, with Christ join thou in fight; 
Stick to the tents that he hath pight; 
Within his crib is surest ward, 
This little babe will be thy guard. 
If thou wilt foil thy foes with joy, 
Then flit not from this heavenly boy.





Delia 2:Go wailing verse, the infants of my love
 

Go wailing verse, the infants of my love, 
Minerva-like, brought forth without a Mother: 
Present the image of the cares I prove, 
Witness your Father's grief exceeds all other. 
Sigh out a story of her cruel deeds, 
With interrupted accents of despair: 
A monument that whosoever reads, 
May justly praise, and blame my loveless Fair. 
Say her disdain hath dried up my blood, 
And starved you, in succours still denying: 
Press to her eyes, importune me some good; 
Waken her sleeping pity with your crying. 
Knock at that hard heart, beg till you have moved her; 
And tell th'unkind, how dearly I have loved her.





Delia 32:But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again
 

But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again, 
Now whilst thy May hath filed thy lap with flowers, 
Now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain, 
Now use the summer smiles, ere winter lowers. 
And whilst thou spread'st unto the rising sun 
The fairest flower that ever saw the light, 
Now joy thy time before thy sweet be done, 
And, Delia, think thy morning must have night, 
And that thy brightness sets at length to west, 
When thou wilt close up that which now thou shew'st; 
And think the same becomes they fading best 
Which then shall most inveil and shadow most. 
Men do not weigh the stalk for what it was, 
When once they find her flower, her glory, pass.





Delia 37:When men shall find thy flower, thy glory pass
 

When men shall find thy flower, thy glory pass, 
And thou, with careful brow sitting alone, 
Receivd hast this message from thy glass, 
That tells thee truth, and says that all is gone, 
Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou madest, 
Though spent thy flame, in me the heat remaining, 
I that have loved thee thus before thou fadest, 
My faith shall wax, when thou art in thy waning. 
The world shall find this miracle in me, 
That fire can burn when all the matter's spent; 
Then what my faith hath been thyself shall see, 
And that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent. 
Thou mayst repent that thou hast scorned my tears, 
When Winter snows upon thy golden hairs.





Delia 53:Unhappy pen and ill accepted papers
 

Unhappy pen and ill accepted papers, 
That intimate in vain my chaste desires, 
My chaste desires, the ever burning tapers, 
Enkindled by her eyes' celestial fires. 
Celestial fires and unrespecting powers, 
That deign not view the glory of your might, 
In humble lines the work of careful hours, 
The sacrifice I offer to her sight. 
But since she scorns her own, this rests for me, 
I'll moan my self, and hide the wrong I have: 
And so content me that her frowns should be 
To my infant style the cradle, and the grave. 
What though my self no honor get thereby, 
Each bird sings t'herself, and so will I.





Are They Shadows
 

Are they shadows that we see?
And can shadows pleasure give?
Pleasures only shadows be 
Cast by bodies we conceive 
And are made the things we deem
In those figures which they seem.

But these pleasures vanish fast
Which by shadows are expressed;
Pleasures are not, if they last;
In their passing is their best.
Glory is most bright and gay
In a flash, and so away.

Feed apace then, greedy eyes,
On the wonder you behold;
Take it sudden as it flies,
Though you take it not to hold.
When your eyes have done their part,
Thought must length it in the heart.





A Roundelay between Two Shepherds
 

1 Shep.         Tell me, thou gentle shepherd swain,

                     Who's yonder in the vale is set?

2 Shep.         Oh, it is she, whose sweets do stain

                     The lily, rose, the violet!


1 Shep.         Why doth the sun against his kind,

                     Fix his bright chariot in the skies?

2 Shep.         Because the sun is stricken blind

                     With looking on her heavenly eyes.


1 Shep.         Why do thy flocks forbear their food,

                     Which sometime were thy chief delight?

2 Shep.         Because they need no other good

                     That live in presence of her sight.


1 Shep.         Why look these flowers so pale and ill,

                     That once attired this goodly heath?

2 Shep.         She hath robb'd Nature of her skill,

                     And sweetens all things with her breath.


1 Shep.         Why slide these brooks so slow away,

                     Whose bubbling murmur pleased thine ear?

2 Shep.         Oh, marvel not although they stay,

                     When they her heavenly voice do hear!


1 Shep.         From whence come all these shepherd swains,

                     And lovely nymphs attired in green?

2 Shep.         From gathering garlands on the plains,

                     To crown our fair the shepherds' queen.


Both.            The sun that lights this world below,

                     Flocks, flowers, and brooks will witness bear:

                     These nymphs and shepherds all do know,

                     That it is she is only fair.





Idea 14: "If he from heaven that filched that living fire
 

If he from heaven that filched that living fire 
Condemned by Jove to endless torment be, 
I greatly marvel how you still go free, 
That far beyond Prometheus did aspire. 
The fire he stole, although of heavenly kind, 
Which from above he craftily did take, 
Of liveless clods, us living men to make, 
He did bestow in temper of the mind. 
But you broke into heaven's immortal store, 
Where virtue, honor, wit, and beauty lay; 
Which taking thence you have escaped away, 
Yet stand as free as ere you did before; 
   Yet old Prometheus punished for his rape. 
   Thus poor thieves suffer when the greater scape.





Sonnet  1: From fairest creatures we desire increase
 

From fairest creatures we desire increase, 
That thereby beauty's rose might never die, 
But as the riper should by time decrease, 
His tender heir might bear his memory; 
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes, 
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, 
Making a famine where abundance lies, 
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel. 
Though that art now the world's fresh ornament 
And only herald to the gaudy spring, 
Within thine own bud buriest thy content, 
And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding. 
   Pity the world, or else this glutton be, 
   To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.





Sonnet  3: Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
 

Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest, 
Now is the time that face should form another, 
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, 
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. 
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb 
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? 
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb 
Of his self-love, to stop posterity? 
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee 
Calls back the lovely April of her prime; 
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see, 
Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time. 
    But if thou live rememb'red not to be, 
    Die single, and thine image dies with thee.





Sonnet 35: No more be grieved at that which thou hast done
 

No more be grieved at that which thou hast done: 
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud, 
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, 
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud. 
All men make faults, and even I in this, 
Authrizing thy trespass with compare, 
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss, 
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are: 
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense-- 
Thy adverse party is thy advocate-- 
And gainst myself a lawful plea commence. 
Such civil war is in my love and hate, 
   That I an ccessory needs must be 
   To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.





Sonnet 65: Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea
 

Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea 
But sad mortality o'er-sways their power, 
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, 
Whose action is no stronger than a flower? 
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out 
Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days, 
When rocks impregnable are not so stout, 
Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays? 
O fearful meditation! where, alack, 
Shall time's best jewel from time's chest lie hid? 
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back? 
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid? 
   O, none, unless this miracle have might, 
   That in black ink my love may still shine bright.





Sonnet 76: Why is my verse so barren of new pride
 

Why is my verse so barren of new pride, 
So far from variation or quick change? 
Why with the time do I not glance aside 
To new-found methods, and to compounds strange? 
Why write I still all one, ever the same, 
And keep invention in a noted weed, 
That every word doth almost tell my name, 
Showing their, birth, and where they did proceed? 
O know, sweet love, I always write of you, 
And you and love are still my argument, 
So all my best is dressing old words new, 
Spending again what is already spent: 
   For as the sun is daily new and old, 
   So is my love still telling what is told.





Sonnet 87: Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing
 

Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing, 
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate. 
The Charter of thy worth gives thee releasing; 
My bonds in thee are all determinate. 
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting, 
And for that riches where is my deserving? 
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, 
And so my patent back again is swerving. 
Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing, 
Or me, to whom thou gav'st is, else mistaking, 
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing, 
Comes home again, on better judgement making. 
   Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter: 
   In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.





Sonnet 126: O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy powr
 

O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy pow'r 
Dost hold time's fickle glass his sickle hour, 
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st 
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st-- 
In nature, sovereign mistress over wrack, 
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back, 
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill 
May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill. 
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure; 
She may detain but not still keep her treasure. 
   Her audit, though delayed, answered must be, 
   And her quietus is to render thee.





Sonnet 135: Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will
 

Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will, 
And Will to boot, and Will in overplus; 
More than enough am I that vex thee still, 
To thy sweet will making addition thus. 
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious, 
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine? 
Shall will in others seem right gracious, 
And in my will no fair acceptance shine? 
The sea, all water, yet receives rain still, 
And in abundance addeth to his store; 
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will 
One will of mine, to make thy large Will more. 
   Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill; 
   Think all but one, and me in that one Will.





Sonnet 144: Two loves I have of comfort and despair
 

Two loves I have of comfort and despair, 
Which like two spirits do suggest me still 
The better angel is a man right fair, 
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill. 
To win me soon to hell, my female evil 
Tempteth my better angel from my side, 
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil, 
Wooing his purity with her foul pride. 
And, whether that my angel be turn'd fiend, 
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell, 
But being both from me both to each friend, 
I guess one angel in another's hell. 
   Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt, 
   Till my bad angel fire my good one out.





Song: "Blow, blow, thou winter wind
 

Blow, blow, thou winter wind, 
   Thou art not so unkind 
      As man's ingratitude; 
   Thy tooth is not so keen, 
Because thou art not seen, 
      Although thy breath be rude. 
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly: 
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly: 
   Then, heigh-ho, the holly! 
      This life is most jolly. 

   Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky, 
   That dost not bite so nigh 
      As benefits forgot: 
   Though thou the waters warp, 
      Thy sting is not so sharp 
      As friend remembered not. 
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly...





Song:"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more
 

(from Much Ado About Nothing)
Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more. 
    Men were deceivers ever, 
One foot in sea, and one on shore, 
    To one thing constant never. 
Then sigh not so, but let them go, 
    And be you blithe and bonny, 
Converting all your sounds of woe 
    Into hey nonny, nonny. 

Sing no more ditties, sing no moe 
    Of dumps so dull and heavy. 
The fraud of men was ever so 
    Since summer first was leafy. 
Then sigh not so, but let them go, 
    And be you blithe and bonny, 
Converting all your sounds of woe 
    Into hey, nonny, nonny.





Song: "Come away, come away, death
 

(from Twelfth Night)
Come away, come away, death, 
    And in sad cypress let me be laid. 
Fly away, fly away, breath; 
    I am slain by a fair cruel maid. 
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, 
             O, prepare it! 
My part of death, no one so true 
         Did share it. 

Not a flower, not a flower sweet, 
    On my black coffin let there be strown. 
Not a friend, not a friend greet 
    My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown. 
A thousand thousand sighs to save, 
             Lay me, O, where 
Sad true lover never find my grave, 
             To weep there!





Song: "Where the bee sucks, there suck I
 

(from The Tempest)
Where the bee sucks, there suck I: 
In a cowslip's bell I lie; 
There I couch when owls do cry. 
On the bat's back I do fly 
After summer merrily.   
Merrily, merrily shall I live now 
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.





My Sweetest Lesbia
 

My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love,
And though the sager sort our deeds reprove,
Let us not weigh them. Heaven's great lamps do dive
Into their west, and straight again revive,
But soon as once set is our little light,
Then must we sleep one ever-during night.

If all would lead their lives in love like me,
Then bloody swords and armor should not be;
No drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move,
Unless alarm came from the camp of love.
But fools do live, and waste their little light,
And seek with pain their ever-during night.

When timely death my life and fortune ends,
Let not my hearse be vexed with mourning friends,
But let all lovers, rich in triumph, come
And with sweet pastimes grace my happy tomb;
And Lesbia, close up thou my little light,
And crown with love my ever-during night.





I Care Not for These Ladies
 

I care not for these ladies,
That must be wooed and prayed:
Give me kind Amaryllis,
The wanton country maid.
Nature art disdaineth,
Her beauty is her own.
    Her when we court and kiss,      
    She cries, Forsooth, let go!
    But when we come where comfort is,
    She never will say no.

If I love Amaryllis,
She gives me fruit and flowers:
But if we love these ladies,
We must give golden showers.
Give them gold, that sell love,
Give me the nut-brown lass,
    Who, when we court and kiss,
    She cries, Forsooth, let go!
    But when we come where comfort is,
    She never will say no.

These ladies must have pillows,
And beds by strangers wrought;
Give me a bower of willows,
Of moss and leaves unbought,
And fresh Amaryllis,
With milk and honey fed;
    Who, when we court and kiss,
    She cries, Forsooth, let go!
    But when we come where comfort is,
    She never will say no.






When to Her Lute Corinna Sings
 

When to her lute Corinna sings,
Her voice revives the leaden strings,
And doth in highest notes appear
As any challenged echo clear;
But when she doth of mourning speak,
Ev'n with her sighs the strings do break.

And as her lute doth live or die,
Let by her passion, so must I:
For when of pleasure she doth sing,
My thoughts enjoy a sudden spring,
But if she doth of sorrow speak, 
Ev'n from my heart the strings do break.





Now Winter Nights Enlarge
 

Now winter nights enlarge
    The number of their hours;
And clouds their storms discharge
    Upon the airy towers.
Let now the chimneys blaze
    And cups o'erflow with wine,
Let well-turned words amaze
    With harmony divine.
Now yellow waxen lights 
    Shall wait on honey love
While youthful revels, masques, and courtly sights
    Sleep's leaden spells remove.

This time doth well dispense
    With lovers' long discourse;
Much speech hath some defense,
    Though beauty no remorse.
All do not all things well;
    Some measures comely tread,
Some knotted riddles tell,
    Some poems smoothly read.
The summer hath his joys,
    And winter his delights;
Though love and all his pleasures are but toys,
    They shorten tedious nights.





In Time of Plague [Adieu, farewell, earths bliss]
 

Adieu, farewell, earth's bliss; 
This world uncertain is; 
Fond are life's lustful joys; 
Death proves them all but toys; 
None from his darts can fly; 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us! 

Rich men, trust not in wealth, 
Gold cannot buy you health; 
Physic himself must fade. 
All things to end are made, 
The plague full swift goes by; 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us! 

Beauty is but a flower 
Which wrinkles will devour; 
Brightness falls from the air; 
Queens have died young and fair; 
Dust hath closed Helen's eye. 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us! 

Strength stoops unto the grave, 
Worms feed on Hector's brave; 
Swords may not fight with fate, 
Earth still holds ope her gate. 
"Come, come! the bells do cry. 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us. 

Wit with his wantonness 
Tasteth death's bitterness; 
Hell's executioner 
Hath no ears for to hear 
What vain art can reply. 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us. 

Haste, therefore, each degree, 
To welcome destiny; 
Heaven is our heritage, 
Earth but a player's stage; 
Mount we unto the sky. 
I am sick, I must die. 
   Lord, have mercy on us.





A Valediction of the Book
 

I'll tell thee now (dear Love) what thou shalt do 
    To anger destiny, as she doth us, 
    How I shall stay, though she esloygne me thus 
And how posterity shall know it too; 
         How thine may out-endure 
         Sybil's glory, and obscure 
         Her who from Pindar could allure, 
    And her, through whose help Lucan is not lame, 
And her, whose book (they say) Homer did find, and name. 

Study our manuscripts, those myriads 
    Of letters, which have past twixt thee and me, 
    Thence write our annals, and in them will be   
To all whom love's subliming fire invades, 
         Rule and example found; 
         There, the faith of any ground 
         No schismatic will dare to wound, 
    That sees, how Love this grace to us affords, 
To make, to keep, to use, to be these his records. 

This book, as long-lived as the elements, 
    Or as the world's form, this all-graved tome 
    In cipher writ, or new made idiom; 
We for love's clergy only'are instruments, 
         When this book is made thus, 
         Should again the ravenous 
         Vandals and the Goths invade us, 
    Learning were safe; in this our universe 
Schools might learn sciences, spheres music, angels verse. 

Here Love's divines (since all divinity 
    Is love or wonder) may find all they seek, 
    Whether abstract spiritual love they like, 
Their souls exhaled with what they do not see, 
         Or loth so to amuse 
         Faith's infirmity, they choose 
         Something which they may see and use; 
    For, though mind be the heaven, where love doth sit, 
Beauty'a convenient type may be to figure it. 

Here more than in their books may lawyers find, 
    Both by what titles mistresses are ours, 
    And how prerogative these states devours, 
Transferred from Love himself, to womankind, 
         Who though from heart, and eyes, 
         They exact great subsidies, 
         Forsake him who on them relies 
    And for the cause, honor, or conscience give, 
Chimeras, vain as they, or their prerogative. 

Here statesmen (or of them, they which can read) 
    May of their occupation find the grounds, 
    Love and their art alike it deadly wounds, 
If to consider what'tis, one proceed, 
         In both they do excel 
         Who the present govern well, 
         Whose weakness none doth, or dares tell; 
    In this thy book, such will there nothing see, 
As in the Bible some can find out alchemy. 

Thus vent thy thoughts; abroad I'll study thee, 
    As he removes far off, that great heights takes; 
    How great love is, presence best trial makes, 
But absence tries how long this love will be; 
         To take a latitude 
         Sun, or stars, are fitliest viewed 
         At their brightest, but to conclude, 
    Of longitudes, what other way have we, 
But to mark when, and where the dark eclipses be?





Elegy VII: Natures lay idiot, I taught thee to love
 

Nature's lay idiot, I taught thee to love, 
And in that sophistry, oh, thou dost prove 
Too subtle: Fool, thou didst not understand 
The mystic language of the eye nor hand: 
Nor couldst thou judge the difference of the air 
Of sighs, and say, this lies, this sounds despair: 
Nor by the'eye's water call a malady 
Desperately hot, or changing feverously. 
I had not taught thee then, the alphabet 
Of flowers, how they devicefully being set 
And bound up, might with speechless secrecy 
Deliver errands mutely, and mutually. 
Remember since all thy words used to be 
To every suitor, "I, 'if my friends agree; 
Since, household charms, thy husband's name to teach, 
Were all the love-tricks, that thy wit could reach; 
And since, an hour's discourse could scarce have made 
One answer in thee, and that ill arrayed   
In broken proverbs, and torn sentences. 
Thou art not by so many duties his, 
That from the'world's common having severed thee, 
Inlaid thee, neither to be seen, nor see, 
As mine: who have with amorous delicacies 
Refined thee'into a blissful paradise. 
Thy graces and good words my creatures be; 
I planted knowledge and life's tree in thee, 
Which oh, shall strangers taste? Must I alas   
Frame and enamel plate, and drink in glass? 
Chafe wax for others' seals? break a colt's force 
And leave him then, being made a ready horse?





To the Reader
 

Pray thee, take care, that tak'st my book in hand, 
To read it well: that is, to understand. 






On My First Daughter
 

Here lies, to each her parents' ruth, 
Mary, the daughter of their youth; 
Yet all heaven's gifts being heaven's due, 
It makes the father less to rue. 
At six months' end she parted hence 
With safety of her innocence; 
Whose soul heaven's queen, whose name she bears, 
In comfort of her mother's tears, 
Hath placed amongst her virgin-train: 
Where, while that severed doth remain, 
This grave partakes the fleshly birth; 
Which cover lightly, gentle earth!





On Spies
 

Spies, you are lights in state, but of base stuff, 
Who, when you've burnt yourselves down to the snuff, 
Stink and are thrown away. End fair enough.





To Fool or Knave
 

Thy praise or dispraise is to me alike:

One doth not stroke me, nor the other strike.







To Sir Henry Cary
 

That neither fame nor love might wanting be 
To greatness, Cary, I sing that and thee; 
Whose house, if it no other honor had, 
In only thee might be both great and glad; 
Who, to upbraid the sloth of this our time, 
Durst valor make almost, but not, a crime; 
Which deed I know not, whether were more high, 
Or thou more happy, it to justify 
Against thy fortune: when no foe, that day, 
Could conquer thee but chance, who did betray. 
Love thy great loss, which a renown hath won, 
To live when Broick not stands, nor Ruhr doth run. 
Love honors, which of best example be 
When they cost dearest and are done most free; 
Though every fortitude deserves applause, 
It may be much or little in the cause. 
He's valiant'st that dares fight, and not for pay; 
That virtuous is, when the reward's away.





On Playwright
 

Playwright, convict of public wrongs to men, 
Takes private beatings and begins again. 
Two kinds of valor he doth show at once: 
Active in 's brain, and passive in his bones. 






To Elizabeth, Countess of Rutland
 

That poets are far rarer births than kings 
Your noblest father proved; like whom before, 
Or then, or since, about our Muses' springs, 
Came not that soul exhausted so their store. 
Hence was it that the destinies decreed 
(Save that most masculine issue of his brain) 
No male unto him; who could so exceed 
Nature, they thought, in all that he would fain. 
At which she, happily displeased, made you, 
On whom, if he were living now to look, 
He should those rare and absolute numbers view, 
As he would burn or better far his book. 






On English Monsieur
 

Would you believe, when you this monsieur see, 
That his whole body should speak French, not he? 
That so much scarf of France, and hat, and feather, 
And shoe, and tie, and garter should come hether, 
And land on one whose face durst never be 
Toward the sea farther than Half-Way Tree? 
That he, untraveled, should be French so much 
As Frenchmen in his company should seem Dutch? 
Or had his father, when he did him get, 
The French disease, with which he labors yet? 
Or hung some monsieur's picture on the wall, 
By which his dam conceived him, clothes and all? 
Or is it some French statue? No: 'T doth move, 
And stoop, and cringe. O then, it needs must prove 
The new French tailor's motion, monthly made, 
Daily to turn in Paul's, and help the trade.





Inviting a Friend to Supper
 

Tonight, grave sir, both my poor house, and I 
Do equally desire your company; 
Not that we think us worthy such a guest, 
But that your worth will dignify our feast 
With those that come, whose grace may make that seem 
Something, which else could hope for no esteem. 
It is the fair acceptance, sir, creates 
The entertainment perfect, not the cates. 
Yet shall you have, to rectify your palate, 
An olive, capers, or some better salad 
Ushering the mutton; with a short-legged hen, 
If we can get her, full of eggs, and then 
Lemons, and wine for sauce; to these a cony 
Is not to be despaired of, for our money; 
And, though fowl now be scarce, yet there are clerks, 
The sky not falling, think we may have larks. 
I'll tell you of more, and lie, so you will come: 
Of partridge, pheasant, woodcock, of which some 
May yet be there, and godwit, if we can; 
Knat, rail, and ruff too. Howsoe'er, my man 
Shall read a piece of Virgil, Tacitus, 
Livy, or of some better book to us, 
Of which we'll speak our minds, amidst our meat; 
And I'll profess no verses to repeat. 
To this, if ought appear which I not know of, 
That will the pastry, not my paper, show of.
Digestive cheese and fruit there sure will be; 
But that which most doth take my Muse and me, 
Is a pure cup of rich Canary wine, 
Which is the Mermaid's now, but shall be mine; 
Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted, 
Their lives, as so their lines, till now had lasted. 
Tobacco, nectar, or the Thespian spring, 
Are all but Luther's beer to this I sing. 
Of this we will sup free, but moderately, 
And we will have no Pooley, or Parrot by, 
Nor shall our cups make any guilty men; 
But, at our parting we will be as when 
We innocently met. No simple word 
That shall be uttered at our mirthful board, 
Shall make us sad next morning or affright 
The liberty that we'll enjoy tonight.





On Gut
 

Gut eats all day and lechers all the night; 
So all his meat he tasteth over twice; 
And, striving so to double his delight, 
He makes himself a thoroughfare of vice. 
Thus in his belly can he change a sin: 
Lust it comes out, that gluttony went in.





To Penshurst
 

Thou art not, Penshurst, built to envious show,

Of touch or marble; nor canst boast a row

Of polished pillars, or a roof of gold;

Thou hast no lantern, whereof tales are told,

Or stair, or courts; but stand'st an ancient pile,

And, these grudged at, art reverenced the while.

Thou joy'st in better marks, of soil, of air,

Of wood, of water; therein thou art fair.

Thou hast thy walks for health, as well as sport;

Thy mount, to which the dryads do resort,

Where Pan and Bacchus their high feasts have made,

Beneath the broad beech and the chestnut shade;

That taller tree, which of a nut was set

At his great birth where all the Muses met.

There in the writhd bark are cut the names

Of many a sylvan, taken with his flames;

And thence the ruddy satyrs oft provoke

The lighter fauns to reach thy Lady's Oak.

Thy copse too, named of Gamage, thou hast there,

That never fails to serve thee seasoned deer

When thou wouldst feast or exercise thy friends.

The lower land, that to the river bends,

Thy sheep, thy bullocks, kine, and calves do feed;

The middle grounds thy mares and horses breed.

Each bank doth yield thee conies; and the tops,

Fertile of wood, Ashore and Sidney's copse,

To crown thy open table, doth provide

The purpled pheasant with the speckled side;

The painted partridge lies in every field,

And for thy mess is willing to be killed.

And if the high-swollen Medway fail thy dish,

Thou hast thy ponds, that pay thee tribute fish,

Fat aged carps that run into thy net,

And pikes, now weary their own kind to eat,

As loath the second draught or cast to stay,

Officiously at first themselves betray;

Bright eels that emulate them, and leap on land

Before the fisher, or into his hand.

Then hath thy orchard fruit, thy garden flowers,

Fresh as the air, and new as are the hours.

The early cherry, with the later plum,

Fig, grape, and quince, each in his time doth come;

The blushing apricot and woolly peach 

Hang on thy walls, that every child may reach.

And though thy walls be of the country stone,

They're reared with no man's ruin, no man's groan;

There's none that dwell about them wish them down;

But all come in, the farmer and the clown,

And no one empty-handed, to salute

Thy lord and lady, though they have no suit.

Some bring a capon, some a rural cake,

Some nuts, some apples; some that think they make

The better cheeses bring them, or else send

By their ripe daughters, whom they would commend

This way to husbands, and whose baskets bear

An emblem of themselves in plum or pear.

But what can this (more than express their love)

Add to thy free provisions, far above

The need of such? whose liberal board doth flow

With all that hospitality doth know;

Where comes no guest but is allowed to eat,

Without his fear, and of thy lord's own meat;

Where the same beer and bread, and selfsame wine,

This is his lordship's shall be also mine,

And I not fain to sit (as some this day

At great men's tables), and yet dine away.

Here no man tells my cups; nor, standing by,

A waiter doth my gluttony envy,

But gives me what I call, and lets me eat;

He knows below he shall find plenty of meat.

The tables hoard not up for the next day;

Nor, when I take my lodging, need I pray

For fire, or lights, or livery; all is there,

As if thou then wert mine, or I reigned here:

There's nothing I can wish, for which I stay.

That found King James when, hunting late this way

With his brave son, the prince, they saw thy fires

Shine bright on every hearth, as the desires

Of thy Penates had been set on flame

To entertain them; or the country came

With all their zeal to warm their welcome here.

What (great I will not say, but) sudden cheer

Didst thou then make 'em! and what praise was heaped 

On thy good lady then, who therein reaped

The just reward of her high housewifery;

To have her linen, plate, and all things nigh,

When she was far; and not a room but dressed

As if it had expected such a guest!

These, Penshurst, are thy praise, and yet not all.

Thy lady's noble, fruitful, chaste withal.

His children thy great lord may call his own,

A fortune in this age but rarely known.

They are, and have been, taught religion; thence

Their gentler spirits have sucked innocence.

Each morn and even they are taught to pray,

With the whole household, and may, every day,

Read in their virtuous parents' noble parts

The mysteries of manners, arms, and arts.

Now, Penshurst, they that will proportion thee

With other edifices, when they see

Those proud, ambitious heaps, and nothing else,

May say their lords have built, but thy lord dwells.





Song: to Celia [Come, my Celia, let us prove]
 

Come, my Celia, let us prove, 
While we can, the sports of love; 
Time will not be ours forever; 
He at length our good will sever. 
Spend not then his gifts in vain. 
Suns that set may rise again; 
But if once we lose this light, 
'Tis with us perpetual night. 
Why should we defer our joys? 
Fame and rumor are but toys. 
Cannot we delude the eyes 
Of a few poor household spies, 
Or his easier ears beguile, 
So removd by our wile? 
'Tis no sin love's fruit to steal; 
But the sweet thefts to reveal, 
To be taken, to be seen, 
These have crimes accounted been.





An Elegy
 

Though beauty be the mark of praise, 
   And yours of whom I sing be such 
   As not the world can praise too much, 
Yet 'tis your virtue now I raise. 

A virtue, like allay, so gone 
   Throughout your form, as, though that move 
   And draw and conquer all men's love, 
This sbjects you to love of one. 

Wherein you triumph yet; because 
   'Tis of yourself, and that you use 
   The noblest freedom, not to choose 
Against or faith or honor's laws. 

But who should less expect from you, 
   In whom alone Love lives again? 
   By whom he is restored to men, 
And kept, and bred, and brought up true. 

His falling temples you have reared, 
   The withered garlands ta'en away; 
   His altars kept from the decay 
That envy wished, and nature feared; 

And on them burn so chaste a flame, 
   With so much loyalties' expense, 
   As Love, t' acquit such excellence, 
Is gone himself into your name. 

And you are he; the deity 
   To whom all lovers are designed 
   That would their better objects find; 
Among which faithful troop am I. 

Who, as an offspring at your shrine, 
   Have sung this hymn, and here entreat 
   One spark of your diviner heat 
To light upon a love of mine. 

Which, if it kindle not, but scant 
   Appear, and that to shortest view, 
   Yet give me leave t' adore in you 
What I in her am grieved to want.





To the Immortal Memory and Friendship of That Noble Pair, Sir Lucius Cary and Sir Henry Morison
 

               The Turn 

Brave infant of Saguntum, clear 
Thy coming forth in that great year, 
When the prodigious Hannibal did crown 
His rage with razing your immortal town. 
Thou, looking then about, 
Ere thou wert half got out, 
Wise child, didst hastily return, 
And mad'st thy mother's womb thine urn. 
How summed a circle didst thou leave mankind   
Of deepest lore, could we the center find! 

               The Counterturn 

Did wiser Nature draw thee back 
From out the horror of that sack, 
Where shame, faith, honor, and regard of right 
Lay trampled on; the deeds of death and night 
Urged, hurried forth, and hurled 
Upon th' affrighted world; 
Sword, fire, and famine, with fell fury met, 
And all on utmost ruin set, 
As, could they but life's miseries foresee, 
No doubt all infants would return like thee? 

               The Stand 

For what is life, if measured by the space, 
Not by the act? 
Or maskd man, if valued by his face 
Above his fact? 
Here's one outlived his peers 
And told forth fourscore years; 
He vexd time and busied the whole state, 
Troubled both foes and friends; 
But ever to no ends: 
What did this stirrer but die late? 
How well at twenty had he fall'n or stood! 
For three of his fourscore he did no good. 

               The Turn 

He entered well, by virtuous parts, 
Got up and thrived with honest arts; 
He purchased friends, and fame, and honors then, 
And had his noble name advanced with men; 
But weary of that flight 
He stooped in all men's sight 
To sordid flatteries, acts of strife, 
And sunk in that dead sea of life 
So deep, as he did then death's waters sup, 
But that the cork of title buoyed him up. 

               The Counterturn 

Alas, but Morison fell young; 
He never fell, thou fall'st, my tongue. 
He stood, a soldier to the last right end, 
A perfect patriot, and a noble friend, 
But most a virtuous son. 
All offices were done 
By him so ample, full, and round, 
In weight, in measure, number, sound, 
As, though his age imperfect might appear, 
His life was of humanity the sphere. 

               The Stand 

Go now, and tell out days summed up with fears, 
And make them years; 
Produce thy mass of miseries on the stage   
To swell thin age; 
Repeat of things a throng, 
To show thou hast been long, 
Not lived; for life doth her great actions spell 
By what was done and wrought 
In season, and so brought 
To light: her measures are, how well 
Each syllabe answered, and was formed how fair; 
These make the lines of life, and that's her air. 

               The Turn 

It is not growing like a tree 
In bulk doth make man better be; 
Or standing long an oak, three hundred year, 
To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere: 
A lily of a day 
Is fairer far in May; 
Although it fall and die that night, 
It was the plant and flower of light. 
In small proportions we just beauties see, 
And in short measures life may perfect be. 

               The Counterturn 

Call, noble Lucius, then for wine, 
And let thy looks with gladness shine; 
Accept this garland, plant it on thy head, 
And think, nay know, thy Morison's not dead. 
He leaped the present age, 
Possessed with holy rage 
To see that bright eternal day; 
Of which we priests and poets say 
Such truths as we expect for happy men, 
And there he lives with memory, and Ben 

               The Stand 

Jonson! who sung thus of him, ere he went 
Himself to rest, 
Or taste a part of that full joy he meant   
To have expressed   
In this bright asterism; 
Where it were friendship's schism 
(Were not his Lucius long with us to tarry) 
To separate these twi- 
Lights, the Dioscuri, 
And keep the one half from his Harry. 
But fate doth so alternate the design, 
Whilst that in heaven, this light on earth must shine. 

               The Turn 

And shine as you exalted are, 
Two names of friendship, but one star: 
Of hearts the union. And those not by chance 
Made, or indenture, or leased out t'advance 
The profits for a time. 
No pleasures vain did chime 
Of rimes, or riots, at your feasts, 
Orgies of drink, or feigned protests, 
But simple love of greatness and of good; 
That knits brave minds and manners more than blood. 

               The Counterturn 

This made you first to know the why 
You liked, then after to apply 
That liking, and approach so one the tother, 
Till either grew a portion of the other: 
Each styled by his end 
The copy of his friend. 
You lived to be the great surnames 
And titles by which all made claims 
Unto the virtue. Nothing perfect done, 
But as a Cary, or a Morison. 

               The Stand 

And such a force the fair example had, 
As they that saw 
The good, and durst not practice it, were glad 
That such a law 
Was left yet to mankind; 
Where they might read and find 
Friendship, indeed, was written, not in words; 
And with the heart, not pen, 
Of two so early men, 
Whose lines her rolls were, and recrds, 
Who, ere the first down bloomd on the chin, 
Had sowed these fruits, and got the harvest in.





"Though I am young, and cannot tell
 

Though I am young, and cannot tell 
    Either what Death or Love is well, 
Yet I have heard they both bear darts, 
    And both do aim at human hearts. 
And then again, I have been told 
    Love wounds with heat, as Death with cold; 
So that I fear they do but bring 
    Extremes to touch, and mean one thing. 

As in a ruin we it call 
    One thing to be blown up, or fall; 
Or to our end like way may have 
    By a flash of lightning, or a wave; 
So Love's inflamd shaft or brand 
    May kill as soon as Death's cold hand; 
Except Love's fires the virtue have 
    To fight the frost out of the grave.





A Sonnet to the Noble Lady, the Lady Mary Wroth
 

I that have been a lover, and could show it,

    Though not in these, in rithmes not wholly dumb,

    Since I exscribe your sonnets, am become

A better lover, and much better poet.

Nor is my Muse or I ashamed to owe it

    To those true numerous graces, whereof some

    But charm the senses, others overcome

    Both brains and hearts; and mine now best do know it:

For in your verse all Cupid's armory,

    His flames, his shafts, his quiver, and his bow,

    His very eyes are yours to overthrow.

But then his mother's sweets you so apply,

    Her joys, her smiles, her loves, as readers take

    For Venus' ceston every line you make.







Slow, Slow, Fresh Fount
 

   Slow, slow, fresh fount, keep time with my salt tears;

   Yet slower, yet, O faintly, gentle springs!

   List to the heavy part the music bears,

   Woe weeps out her division, when she sings.

       Droop herbs and flowers;

       Fall grief in showers;

       Our beauties are not ours.

               O, I could still,

   Like melting snow upon some craggy hill,

       Drop, drop, drop, drop,

Since nature's pride is now a withered daffodil.







Take, Oh, Take Those Lips Away
 

Take, oh, take those lips away
That so sweetly were forsworn
And those eyes, like break of day,
Lights that do mislead the morn;
But my kisses bring again,
Seals of love, though sealed in vain.

Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow,
Which thy frozen bosom bears,
On whose tops the pinks that grow
Are of those that April wears;
But first set my poor heart free,
Bound in those icy chains by thee.





To the Sour Reader
 

If thou dislik'st the piece thou light'st on first, 
Think that of all that I have writ the worst; 
But if thou read'st my book unto the end, 
And still dost this and that verse reprehend, 
O perverse man! If all disgustful be, 
The extreme scab take thee and thine, for me. 






Upon Julias Breasts
 

Display thy breasts, my Julia, there let me
Behold that circummortal purity;
Between whose glories, there my lips I'll lay,
Ravished in that fair Via Lactea.






Song: "Who is Silvia? what is she
 

(from Two Gentlemen of Verona)
Who is Silvia? what is she, 
    That all our swains commend her? 
Holy, fair, and wise is she; 
    The heaven such grace did lend her, 
That she might admird be. 

Is she kind as she is fair? 
    For beauty lives with kindness. 
Love doth to her eyes repair, 
    To help him of his blindness; 
And, being helped, inhabits there. 

Then to Silvia let us sing, 
    That Silvia is excelling; 
She excels each mortal thing 
    Upon the dull earth dwelling; 
 To her let us garlands bring





Upon a Child That Died
 

Here she lies, a pretty bud, 
Lately made of flesh and blood, 
Who as soon fell fast asleep 
As her little eyes did peep. 
Give her strewings, but not stir 
The earth that lightly covers her.





Kind Are Her Answers
 

   Kind are her answers,
   But her performance keeps no day;
   Breaks time, as dancers
   From their own music when they stray:
   All her free favors
And smooth words wing my hopes in vain.
O did ever voice so sweet but only feign?
   Can true love yield such delay,
   Converting joy to pain?

   Lost is our freedom,
   When we submit to women so:
   Why do we need 'em,
   When in their best they work our woe?
   There is no wisdom
Can alter ends, by Fate prefixed.
O why is the good of man with evil mixed?
   Never were days yet called two,
   But one night went betwixt.






Upon Prue, His Maid
 

In this little urn is laid 
Prudence Baldwin, once my maid, 
From whose happy spark here let 
Spring the purple violet.





Upon Ben Jonson
 

Here lies Jonson with the rest 
Of the poets; but the best. 
Reader, would'st thou more have known? 
Ask his story, not this stone. 
That will speak what this can't tell 
Of his glory. So farewell.





The Pillar of Fame
 

            Fame's pillar here at last we set, 
            Out-during marble, brass or jet; 
                Charmed and enchanted so 
                  As to withstand the blow 
                     O f   o v e r t h r o w ; 
                    Nor   shall   the   seas, 
                      Or     o u t r a g e s 
                    Of   storms,   o'erbear 
                     What    we    uprear; 
                    Tho'   kingdoms   fall, 
                 This   pillar   never   shall 
                 Decline   or waste at   all; 
        But   stand   for ever   by   his   own 
        Firm   and    well-fixed    foundation.





Neutrality Loathsome
 

God will have all, or none; serve Him, or fall 
Down before Baal, Bel, or Belial: 
Either be hot, or cold: God doth despise, 
Abhorre, and spew out all Neutralities.





To Find God
 

Weigh me the fire; or canst thou find 
A way to measure out the wind? 
Distinguish all those floods that are 
Mixed in that wat'ry theater, 
And taste thou them as saltless there, 
As in their channel first they were.   
Tell me the people that do keep 
Within the kingdoms of the deep; 
Or fetch me back that cloud again, 
Beshivered into seeds of rain. 
Tell me the motes, dust, sands, and spears 
Of corn, when summer shakes his ears; 
Show me that world of stars, and whence 
They noiseless spill their influence. 
This if thou canst; then show me Him 
That rides the glorious cherubim.





The White Island, or Place of the Blest
 

      In this world, the isle of dreams, 
      While we sit by sorrow's streams, 
      Tears and terrors are our themes 
                     Reciting: 

      But when once from hence we fly, 
      More and more approaching nigh 
             Unto young eternity, 
                     Uniting: 

       In that whiter island, where 
       Things are evermore sincere; 
       Candor here and luster there 
                   Delighting: 

    There no monstrous fancies shall 
       Out of hell an horror call, 
       To create, or cause at all, 
                  Affrighting. 

    There, in calm and cooling sleep 
      We our eyes shall never steep, 
       But eternal watch shall keep, 
                   Attending 

    Pleasures, such as shall pursue 
         Me immortalized, and you; 
        And fresh joys, as never too 
                  Have ending.





Redemption
 

Having been tenant long to a rich lord, 
    Not thriving, I resolvd to be bold, 
    And make a suit unto him, to afford 
A new small-rented lease, and cancel th' old. 

In heaven at his manor I him sought; 
    They told me there that he was lately gone 
    About some land, which he had dearly bought 
Long since on earth, to take possessin. 

I straight returned, and knowing his great birth, 
    Sought him accordingly in great resorts; 
    In cities, theaters, gardens, parks, and courts; 
At length I heard a ragged noise and mirth 
          
    Of thieves and murderers; there I him espied, 
    Who straight, Your suit is granted, said, and died.





The Windows
 

Lord, how can man preach thy eternal word? 
    He is a brittle crazy glass; 
Yet in thy temple thou dost him afford 
    This glorious and transcendent place, 
    To be a window, through thy grace. 

But when thou dost anneal in glass thy story, 
    Making thy life to shine within 
The holy preachers, then the light and glory 
    More reverend grows, and more doth win; 
    Which else shows waterish, bleak, and thin. 

Doctrine and life, colors and light, in one 
    When they combine and mingle, bring 
A strong regard and awe; but speech alone 
    Doth vanish like a flaring thing, 
    And in the ear, not conscience, ring.





Denial
 

    When my devotions could not pierce

                              Thy silent ears,

Then was my heart broken, as was my verse;

         My breast was full of fears

                              And disorder.


    My bent thoughts, like a brittle bow,

                               Did fly asunder:

Each took his way; some would to pleasures go,

          Some to the wars and thunder

                               Of alarms.


    As good go anywhere, they say,

                               As to benumb

Both knees and heart, in crying night and day,

         Come, come, my God, O come!

                               But no hearing.


    O that thou shouldst give dust a tongue

                               To cry to thee,

And then not hear it crying! All day long

          My heart was in my knee,

                               But no hearing.


    Therefore my soul lay out of sight,

                               Untuned, unstrung:

My feeble spirit, unable to look right,

          Like a nipped blossom, hung

                               Discontented.


    O cheer and tune my heartless breast,

                               Defer no time;

That so thy favors granting my request,

          They and my mind may chime,

                               And mend my rhyme.





Vanity (I)
 

The fleet astronomer can bore 
And thread the spheres with his quick-piercing mind: 
He views their stations, walks from door to door, 
         Surveys, as if he had designed 
To make a purchase there; he sees their dances, 
                   And knoweth long before 
Both their full-eyes aspcts, and secret glances. 

         The nimble diver with his side 
Cuts through the working waves, that he may fetch 
His dearly-earnd pearl, which God did hide 
         On purpose from the venturous wretch; 
That he might save his life, and also hers 
                   Who with excessive pride 
Her own destruction and his danger wears. 

         The subtle chymic can divest 
And strip the creature naked, till he find 
The callow principles within their nest: 
         There he imparts to them his mind, 
Admitted to their bed-chamber, before 
                   They appear trim and dressed 
To ordinary suitors at the door. 

         What hath not man sought out and found, 
But his dear God? who yet his glorious law 
Embosoms in us, mellowing the ground 
         With showers and frosts, with love and awe, 
So that we need not say, "Where's this command? 
                   Poor man, thou searchest round 
To find out death, but missest life at hand.





Life
 

I made a posy, while the day ran by: 
"Here will I smell my remnant out, and tie 
                           My life within this band. 
But Time did beckon to the flowers, and they 
By noon most cunningly did steal away, 
                           And withered in my hand. 

My hand was next to them, and then my heart; 
I took, without more thinking, in good part 
                           Time's gentle admonition; 
Who did so sweetly death's sad taste convey, 
Making my mind to smell my fatal day, 
                           Yet, sug'ring the suspicion. 

Farewell dear flowers, sweetly your time ye spent, 
Fit, while ye lived, for smell or ornament, 
                           And after death for cures. 
I follow straight without complaints or grief, 
Since, if my scent be good, I care not if 
                           It be as short as yours.





Artillery
 

As I one evening sat before my cell, 
Methought a star did shoot into my lap. 
I rose and shook my clothes, as knowing well 
That from small fires comes oft no small mishap; 
       When suddenly I heard one say, 
       "Do as thou usest, disobey, 
       Expel good motions from thy breast, 
Which have the face of fire, but end in rest. 

I, who had heard of music in the spheres, 
But not of speech in stars, began to muse; 
But turning to my God, whose ministers 
The stars and all things are: "If I refuse, 
       Dread Lord, said I, "so oft my good, 
       Then I refuse not ev'n with blood 
       To wash away my stubborn thought; 
For I will do or suffer what I ought. 

"But I have also stars and shooters too, 
Born where thy servants both artilleries use. 
My tears and prayers night and day do woo 
And work up to thee; yet thou dost refuse. 
       Not but I am (I must say still) 
       Much more obliged to do thy will 
       Than thou to grant mine; but because 
Thy promise now hath ev'n set thee thy laws. 

"Then we are shooters both, and thou dost deign 
To enter combat with us, and contest 
With thine own clay. But I would parley fain: 
Shun not my arrows, and behold my breast. 
       Yet if thou shunnest, I am thine: 
       I must be so, if I am mine. 
       There is no articling with thee: 
I am but finite, yet thine infinitely.





The Flower
 

How fresh, oh Lord, how sweet and clean 
Are thy returns! even as the flowers in spring; 
         To which, besides their own demean, 
The late-past frosts tributes of pleasure bring. 
                      Grief melts away 
                      Like snow in May, 
         As if there were no such cold thing. 

         Who would have thought my shriveled heart 
Could have recovered greenness? It was gone 
         Quite underground; as flowers depart 
To see their mother-root, when they have blown, 
                      Where they together 
                      All the hard weather, 
         Dead to the world, keep house unknown. 

         These are thy wonders, Lord of power, 
Killing and quickening, bringing down to hell 
         And up to heaven in an hour; 
Making a chiming of a passing-bell. 
                      We say amiss 
                      This or that is: 
         Thy word is all, if we could spell. 

         Oh that I once past changing were, 
Fast in thy Paradise, where no flower can wither! 
         Many a spring I shoot up fair, 
Offering at heaven, growing and groaning thither; 
                      Nor doth my flower 
                      Want a spring shower, 
         My sins and I joining together. 

         But while I grow in a straight line, 
Still upwards bent, as if heaven were mine own, 
         Thy anger comes, and I decline: 
What frost to that? what pole is not the zone 
                      Where all things burn, 
                      When thou dost turn, 
         And the least frown of thine is shown? 

         And now in age I bud again, 
After so many deaths I live and write; 
         I once more smell the dew and rain, 
And relish versing. Oh, my only light, 
                      It cannot be 
                      That I am he 
         On whom thy tempests fell all night. 

         These are thy wonders, Lord of love, 
To make us see we are but flowers that glide; 
         Which when we once can find and prove, 
Thou hast a garden for us where to bide; 
                      Who would be more, 
                      Swelling through store, 
         Forfeit their Paradise by their pride.





The Forerunners
 

The harbingers are come. See, see their mark: 
White is their color, and behold my head. 
But must they have my brain? Must they dispark 
Those sparkling notions, which therein were bred? 
    Must dullness turn me to a clod? 
Yet have they left me, Thou art still my God. 

Good men ye be, to leave me my best room, 
Ev'n all my heart, and what is lodgd there:   
I pass not, I, what of the rest become, 
So Thou art still my God be out of fear. 
    He will be pleasd with that ditty: 
And if I please him, I write fine and witty. 

Farewell sweet phrases, lovely metaphors. 
But will ye leave me thus? When ye before 
Of stews and brothels only knew the doors, 
Then did I wash you with my tears, and more, 
    Brought you to church well dressed and clad: 
My God must have my best, ev'n all I had. 

Lovely enchanting language, sugar-cane, 
Honey of roses, wither wilt thou fly? 
Hath some fond lover 'ticed thee to thy bane? 
And wilt thou leave the church and love a sty? 
         Fie, thou wilt soil thy broidered coat, 
And hurt thyself, and him that sings the note. 

Let foolish lovers, if they will love dung, 
With canvas, not with arras, clothe their shame: 
Let folly speak in her own native tongue. 
True beauty dwells on high: ours is a flame 
    But borrowed thence to light us thither. 
Beauty and beauteous words should go together. 

Yet if you go, I pass not; take your way: 
For Thou art still my God is all that ye 
Perhaps with more embellishment can say. 
Go, birds of spring: let winter have his fee; 
    Let a bleak paleness chalk the door, 
So all within be livelier than before.





Discipline
 

Throw away thy rod, 
Throw away thy wrath: 
                  O my God, 
Take the gentle path. 

For my heart's desire 
Unto thine is bent: 
                  I aspire 
To a full consent. 

Not a word or look 
I affect to own, 
                  But by book, 
And thy book alone. 

Though I fail, I weep: 
Though I halt in pace, 
                  Yet I creep 
To the throne of grace. 

Then let wrath remove; 
Love will do the deed: 
                  For with love 
Stony hearts will bleed. 

Love is swift of foot; 
Love's a man of war, 
                  And can shoot, 
And can hit from far. 

Who can 'scape his bow? 
That which wrought on thee, 
                  Brought thee low, 
Needs must work on me. 

Throw away thy rod; 
Though man frailties hath, 
         Thou art God: 
Throw away thy wrath.





Death
 

Death, thou wast once an uncouth hideous thing, 
                           Nothing but bones, 
      The sad effect of sadder groans: 
Thy mouth was open, but thou couldst not sing. 

For we considered thee as at some six 
                           Or ten years hence, 
      After the loss of life and sense, 
Flesh being turned to dust, and bones to sticks. 

We looked on this side of thee, shooting short; 
                         Where we did find 
      The shells of fledge souls left behind, 
Dry dust, which sheds no tears, but may extort. 

But since our Savior's death did put some blood 
                           Into thy face, 
      Thou art grown fair and full of grace, 
Much in request, much sought for as a good. 

For we do now behold thee gay and glad, 
                           As at Doomsday; 
      When souls shall wear their new array, 
And all thy bones with beauty shall be clad. 

Therefore we can go die as sleep, and trust 
                           Half that we have 
      Unto an honest faithful grave; 
Making our pillows either down, or dust.





from Ajax: Dirge
 

The glories of our blood and state 
Are shadows, not substantial things; 
There is no armor against fate; 
Death lays his icy hand on kings. 
    Scepter and crown 
    Must tumble down 
And in the dust be equal made 
With the poor crooked scythe and spade. 

Some men with swords may reap the field 
And plant fresh laurels where they kill, 
But their strong nerves at last must yield; 
They tame but one another still. 
    Early or late 
    They stoop to fate 
And must give up their murmuring breath, 
When they, pale captives, creep to death. 

The garlands wither on your brow, 
Then boast no more your mighty deeds; 
Upon death's purple altar now 
See where the victor-victim bleeds. 
    Your heads must come 
    To the cold tomb; 
Only the actions of the just 
Smell sweet and blossom in their dust.





Sonnet 13:Harry, whose tuneful and well-measured song
 

To Mr. H. Lawes, On His Airs
Harry, whose tuneful and well-measured song 
      First taught our English music how to span 
      Words with just note and accent, not to scan 
      With Midas' ears, committing short and long, 
Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng, 
      With praise enough for Envy to look wan; 
      To after-age thou shalt be writ the man 
      That with smooth air couldst humor best our tongue. 
Thou honor'st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing 
      To honor thee, the priest of Phbus' choir, 
      That tun'st their happiest lines in hymn or story. 
Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher 
      Than his Casella, whom he wooed to sing, 
      Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.





Sonnet 21:Cyriack, whose grandsire on the royal bench
 

Cyriack, whose grandsire on the royal bench 
      Of British Themis, with no mean applause, 
      Pronounced, and in his volumes taught, our laws, 
      Which others at their bar so often wrench, 
Today deep thoughts resolve with me to drench 
      In mirth that after no repenting draws; 
      Let Euclid rest, and Archimedes pause, 
      And what the Swede intend, and what the French. 
To measure life learn thou betimes, and know 
      Toward solid good what leads the nearest way; 
      For other things mild Heaven a time ordains, 
And disapproves that care, though wise in show, 
      That with superfluous burden loads the day, 
      And, when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.





Sonnet II: Of thee, kind boy, I ask no red and white
 

Of thee, kind boy, I ask no red and white, 
    To make up my delight; 
    No odd becoming graces, 
Black eyes, or little know-not-whats in faces; 
Make me but mad enough, give me good store 
Of love for her I count; 
    I ask no more, 
'Tis love in love that makes the sport. 

There's no such thing as that we beauty call, 
    It is mere cozenage all; 
    For though some, long ago, 
Liked certain colors mingled so and so, 
That doth not tie me now from choosing new; 
If I a fancy take 
    To black and blue, 
That fancy doth it beauty make. 

'Tis not the meat, but 'tis the appetite 
    Makes eating a delight; 
    And if I like one dish 
More than another, that a pheasant is; 
What in our watches, that in us is found: 
So to the height and nick 
    We up be wound, 
No matter by what hand or trick.





Upon My Lady Carlisles Walking in Hampton Court Garden
 

                DIALOGUE

            T.C.          J.S.

               Thom. 

Didst thou not find the place inspired,
And flowers, as if they had desired
No other sun, start from their beds,
And for a sight steal out their heads?
Heardst thou not music when she talked?
And didst not find that as she walked
She threw rare perfumes all about,
Such as bean-blossoms newly out,
Or chafd spices give?--

                  J.S. 

I must confess those perfumes, Tom,
I did not smell; nor found that from
Her passing by ought sprung up new.
The flowers had all their birth from you;
For I passed o'er the self-same walk
And did not find one single stalk
Of anything that was to bring
This unknown after-after-spring.

               Thom. 

Dull and insensible, couldst see
A thing so near a deity
Move up and down, and feel no change?

                  J.S. 

None, and so great, were alike strange;
I had my thoughts, but not your way.
All are not born, sir, to the bay.
Alas! Tom, I am flesh and blood,
And was consulting how I could
In spite of masks and hoods descry
The parts denied unto the eye.
I was undoing all she wore,
And had she walked but one turn more,
Eve in her first state had not been
More naked or more plainly seen.

               Thom. 

'Twas well for thee she left the place;
There is great danger in that face.
But hadst thou viewed her leg and thigh,
And upon that discovery
Searched after parts that are more dear
(As fancy seldom stops so near),
No time or age had ever seen
So lost a thing as thou hadst been.





To the Infant Martyrs
 

Go, smiling souls, your new-built cages break, 
In heaven you'll learn to sing, ere here to speak, 
Nor let the milky fonts that bathe your thirst 
                                           Be your delay; 
The place that calls you hence is, at the worst, 
                                           Milk all the way.





Upon the Infant Martyrs
 

To see both blended in one flood, 
The mothers' milk, the children's blood, 
Makes me doubt if heaven will gather 
Roses hence, or lilies rather.





The Tear
 

What bright soft thing is this? 
    Sweet Mary, the fair eyes' expense? 
    A moist spark it is, 
    A wat'ry diamond; from whence 
The very term, I think, was found 
The water of a diamond. 

    O 'tis not a tear, 
 'Tis a star about to drop 
From thine eye its sphere; 
   The sun will stoop and take it up. 
Proud will his sister be to wear 
This thine eyes' jewel in her ear. 

    O 'tis a tear 
 Too true a tear; for no sad eyne, 
    How sad so e're, 
 Rain so true a teare as thine; 
Each drop leaving a place so dear, 
Weeps for itself, is its own tear. 

    Such a pearl as this is, 
   (Slipped from Aurora's dewy breast) 
The rose bud's sweet lip kisses; 
   And such the rose itself, when vexed 
With ungentle flames, does shed, 
Sweating in too warm a bed. 

    Such the maiden gem, 
   By the wanton spring put on, 
Peeps from her parent stem, 
   And blushes on the manly sun: 
This wat'ry blossom of thy eyne, 
Ripe, will make the richer wine. 

    Faire drop, why quak'st thou so? 
 'Cause thou straight must lay thy head 
    In the dust? o no; 
   The dust shall never be thy bed: 
A pillow for thee will I bring, 
Stuffed with down of angels' wing. 

    Thus carried up on high, 
 (For to Heaven thou must go) 
    Sweetly shalt thou lie 
 And in soft slumbers bathe thy woe; 
Till the singing orbs awake thee, 
And one of their bright chorus make thee. 

    There thy self shalt be 
 An eye, but not a weeping one, 
    Yet I doubt of thee, 
 Whether th'hadst rather there have shone 
An eye of Heaven; or still shine here, 
In th'Heaven of Mary's eye, a tear.





Platonic Love
 

                            1

   Indeed I must confess,
   When souls mix 'tis an happiness,
But not complete till bodies too do join,
And both our wholes into one whole combine;
But half of heaven the souls in glory taste
   Till by love in heaven at last 
   Their bodies too are placed.

                            2

   In thy immortal part
   Man, as well as I, thou art.
But something 'tis that differs thee and me,
And we must one even in that difference be.
I thee both as a man and woman prize,
   For a perfect love implies
   Love in all capacities.

                            3

   Can that for true love pass
   When a fair woman courts her glass?
Something unlike must in love's likeness be:
His wonder is one and variety.
For he whose soul nought but a soul can move
   Does a new Narcissus prove,
   And his own image love.

                            4

   That souls do beauty know
   'Tis to the body's help they owe;
If when they know't they straight abuse that trust
And shut the body from't, 'tis as unjust
As if I brought my dearest friend to see
   My mistress and at th'instant he
   Should steal her quite from me.





The Grasshopper
 

To My Noble Friend, Mr. Charles Cotton
O thou that swing'st upon the waving hair 
   Of some well-filld oaten beard, 
Drunk every night with a delicious tear 
   Dropped thee from heaven, where now th' art reared; 

The joys of earth and air are thine entire, 
   That with thy feet and wings dost hop and fly; 
And, when thy poppy works, thou dost retire 
   To thy carved acorn-bed to lie. 

Up with the day, the sun thou welcom'st then, 
   Sport'st in the gilt-plats of his beams, 
And all these merry days mak'st merry men, 
   Thyself, and melancholy streams. 

But ah, the sickle! Golden ears are cropped; 
   Ceres and Bacchus bid good night; 
Sharp, frosty fingers all your flowers have topped, 
   And what scythes spared, winds shave off quite. 

Poor verdant fool, and now green ice! thy joys, 
   Large and as lasting as thy perch of grass, 
Bid us lay in 'gainst winter rain, and poise 
   Their floods with an o'erflowing glass. 

Thou best of men and friends! we will create 
   A genuine summer in each other's breast, 
And spite of this cold time and frozen fate, 
   Thaw us a warm seat to our rest. 

Our sacred hearths shall burn eternally, 
   As vestal flames; the North Wind, he 
Shall strike his frost-stretched wings, dissolve, and fly 
   This Etna in epitome. 

Dropping December shall come weeping in, 
   Bewail th'usurping of his reign: 
But when in showers of old Greek we begin, 
   Shall cry he hath his crown again! 

Night, as clear Hesper, shall our tapers whip 
   From the light casements where we play, 
And the dark hag from her black mantle strip, 
   And stick there everlasting day. 

Thus richer than untempted kings are we, 
   That, asking nothing, nothing need: 
Though lords of all what seas embrace, yet he 
   That wants himself is poor indeed.





"Upon a day, came Sorrow in to me"
 

on the 9th of June 1290
Upon a day, came Sorrow in to me,
    Saying, I've come to stay with thee a while';
    And I perceived that she had ushered Bile
And Pain into my house for company.
Wherefore I said, Go forth  away with thee!'
    But like a Greek she answered, full of guile,
    And went on arguing in an easy style.
Then, looking, I saw Love come silently,
Habited in black raiment, smooth and new,
    Having a black hat set upon his hair;
And certainly the tears he shed were true.
    So that I asked, What ails thee, trifler?'
Answering, he said: A grief to be gone through;
    For our own lady's dying, brother dear.'






A Shropshire Lad 53: The lad came to the door at night
 

The lad came to the door at night, 
    When lovers crown their vows, 
And whistled soft and out of sight 
    In shadow of the boughs. 

I shall not vex you with my face 
    Henceforth, my love, for aye; 
So take me in your arms a space 
    Before the east is grey. 

When I from hence away am past 
    I shall not find a bride, 
And you shall be the first and last 
    I ever lay beside.' 

She heard and went and knew not why; 
    Her heart to his she laid; 
Light was the air beneath the sky 
    But dark under the shade. 

Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast 
    Seems not to rise and fall, 
And here upon my bosom prest 
    There beats no heart at all?' 

Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock, 
    You should have felt it then; 
But since for you I stopped the clock 
    It never goes again.' 

Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips 
    Wet from your neck on mine? 
What is it falling on my lips, 
    My lad, that tastes of brine?' 

Oh like enough 'tis blood, my dear, 
    For when the knife has slit 
The throat across from ear to ear 
    'Twill bleed because of it.'





"I stand alone at the foot "
 

I stand alone at the foot   
Of my father's grave,   
Trembling to tell:   
The door to the granary is open,   
Sir,   
And someone lost the bucket   
To the well.





The Vine
 

I dreamed this mortal part of mine
Was metamorphosed to a vine,
Which crawling one and every way
Enthralled my dainty Lucia.
Methought her long small legs and thighs
I with my tendrils did surprise;
Her belly, buttocks, and her waist
By my soft nervelets were embraced.
About her head I writhing hung,
And with rich clusters (hid among
The leaves) her temples I behung,
So that my Lucia seemed to me
Young Bacchus ravished by his tree.
My curls about her neck did crawl,
And arms and hands they did enthrall,
So that she could not freely stir
(All parts there made one prisoner).
But when I crept with leaves to hide
Those parts which maids keep unespied,
Such fleeting pleasures there I took
That with the fancy I awoke;
And found (ah me!) this flesh of mine
More like a stock than like a vine.






Burial Rites
 

Everyone comes back here to die 
as I will soon. The place feels right 
since it's half dead to begin with. 
Even on a rare morning of rain, 
like this morning, with the low sky 
hoarding its riches except for 
a few mock tears, the hard ground 
accepts nothing. Six years ago 
I buried my mother's ashes 
beside a young lilac that's now 
taller than I, and stuck the stub 
of a rosebush into her dirt, 
where like everything else not 
human it thrives. The small blossoms 
never unfurl; whatever they know 
they keep to themselves until 
a morning rain or a night wind 
pares the petals down to nothing. 
Even the neighbor cat who shits 
daily on the paths and then hides 
deep in the jungle of the weeds 
refuses to purr. Whatever's here 
is just here, and nowhere else, 
so it's right to end up beside 
the woman who bore me, to shovel 
into the dirt whatever's left 
and leave only a name for some- 
one who wants it. Think of it, 
my name, no longer a portion 
of me, no longer inflated 
or bruised, no longer stewing 
in a rich compost of memory 
or the simpler one of bone shards, 
dirt, kitty litter, wood ashes, 
the roots of the eucalyptus 
I planted in '73, 
a tiny me taking nothing, 
giving nothing, and free at last.





In Prison
 

In prison 
without being accused 

or reach your family 
or have a family            You have 

conscience 
heart trouble 

asthma 
manic-depressive 

(we lost the baby) 
no meds 

no one 
no window 

black water 
nail-scratched walls 

your pure face turned away 
embarrassed 

you 
who the earth was for.





Midsummer
 

On nights like this we used to swim in the quarry,   
the boys making up games requiring them to tear off the girls' clothes   
and the girls cooperating, because they had new bodies since last summer 
and they wanted to exhibit them, the brave ones   
leaping off the high rocks--bodies crowding the water. 

The nights were humid, still. The stone was cool and wet, 
marble for graveyards, for buildings that we never saw,   
buildings in cities far away. 

On cloudy nights, you were blind. Those nights the rocks were dangerous,   
but in another way it was all dangerous, that was what we were after.   
The summer started. Then the boys and girls began to pair off   
but always there were a few left at the end--sometimes they'd keep watch, 
sometimes they'd pretend to go off with each other like the rest, 
but what could they do there, in the woods? No one wanted to be them.   
But they'd show up anyway, as though some night their luck would change,   
fate would be a different fate. 

At the beginning and at the end, though, we were all together. 
After the evening chores, after the smaller children were in bed,   
then we were free. Nobody said anything, but we knew the nights we'd meet   
and the nights we wouldn't. Once or twice, at the end of summer,   
we could see a baby was going to come out of all that kissing. 

And for those two, it was terrible, as terrible as being alone.   
The game was over. We'd sit on the rocks smoking cigarettes,   
worrying about the ones who weren't there. 

And then finally walk home through the fields,   
because there was always work the next day.   
And the next day, we were kids again, sitting on the front steps in the morning,   
eating a peach. Just that, but it seemed an honor to have a mouth.   
And then going to work, which meant helping out in the fields.   
One boy worked for an old lady, building shelves.   
The house was very old, maybe built when the mountain was built. 

And then the day faded. We were dreaming, waiting for night.   
Standing at the front door at twilight, watching the shadows lengthen.   
And a voice in the kitchen was always complaining about the heat, 
wanting the heat to break. 

Then the heat broke, the night was clear.   
And you thought of the boy or girl you'd be meeting later.   
And you thought of walking into the woods and lying down,   
practicing all those things you were learning in the water.   
And though sometimes you couldn't see the person you were with, 
there was no substitute for that person. 

The summer night glowed; in the field, fireflies were glinting. 
And for those who understood such things, the stars were sending messages:   
You will leave the village where you were born   
and in another country you'll become very rich, very powerful, 
but always you will mourn something you left behind, even though   
you can't say what it was, 
and eventually you will return to seek it.





Dawn
 

1 

Child waking up in a dark room   
screaming I want my duck back, I want my duck back   

in a language nobody understands in the least-- 

There is no duck. 

But the dog, all upholstered in white plush-- 
the dog is right there in the crib next to him. 

Years and years--that's how much time passes.   
All in a dream. But the duck-- 
no one knows what happened to that. 

                                  2 

They've just met, now   
they're sleeping near an open window. 

Partly to wake them, to assure them   
that what they remember of the night is correct,   
now light needs to enter the room, 

also to show them the context in which this occurred:   
socks half hidden under a dirty mat,   
quilt decorated with green leaves-- 

the sunlight specifying   
these but not other objects,   
setting boundaries, sure of itself, not arbitrary, 

then lingering, describing   
each thing in detail,   
fastidious, like a composition in English,   
even a little blood on the sheets-- 

                                  3 

Afterward, they separate for the day.   
Even later, at a desk, in the market,   
the manager not satisfied with the figures he's given,   
the berries moldy under the topmost layer-- 

so that one withdraws from the world 
even as one continues to take action in it-- 

You get home, that's when you notice the mold.   
Too late, in other words. 

As though the sun blinded you for a moment.





Fowling Piece
 

The pull of guns I understand, 
my father taught me hand on hand 
how death is. Life asserts. 
(Best take it like a man.) 

I shot a dove, the common sort 
and mourned not life but life so short 
that gazed from death as if unhurt. 
And I had nothing to report.





An Old Womans Painting
 

Scrape the sun from the wall of the sky. 
Cast the great nets of autumn over the houses. 
Even the throat of the lily is a dangerous inlet. 

Let the world stand wearily on the stoop of the jail 
of the world and the light of the mind, that small lamp, 
pearl of shine, let the night come to it, as iron filings to a magnet, 
mother.





J. Learns the Difference Between Poverty and Having No Money
 

After Ernesto Trejo
And the morning's marine layer cloud cover's just beginning to unhinge, 
    to let the buttery light of another daybreak slip through 
And weigh down the dead lawns and sagging rooftops 
    of this neighborhood, where Cold War era television antennas 
Still cast shadows like B-52s heading offshore, where poverty, this early 
    is the smell of Malt-O-Meal and the dregs of thin beer 
Washed down the sink. Where the shift begins at 7AM, 
    but consciousness has a way of coming round as slowly   
As this old computer monitor flickers its dull sixteen colors into being. 
    On it, the names and numbers of laundromat and liquor store owners, 
Fast food managers and lawn care companies; it's my job 
    to cold call them, read from a script on the benefits of membership 
In the Executive Dining Club, not take No for an answer. 
    I'm no good and both the boss and I know it, and he's hovering 
When the scraped-out voice of the woman on my phone answers me with 
    My husband's been killed, and then, instead of hanging up,   
Throws the receiver down next to something--dishwasher or window AC, 
    I don't know--but something close, it sounds, to tearing itself apart, 
Something cycling through an awful, screeching noise. 
    And it's because I've paused that the boss flings a pencil 
Into the wall in front of me and edges closer, and because of the fear 
    of unemployment forms or the sky opening up if I were to walk out, 
And because this sound--the un-oiled, flak-fouled crack of it-- 
    has left me standing suddenly at the end of a runway, planes 
Screaming low overhead and loaded for the beginning of the end of the world, 
    that I start back into the script, start back as if I believe each word, 
Even though, in the rattle and dust of the jet-wash, no one hears a thing.





Stemming from Stevens
 

It's not enough to cover the rock with leaves 
 --as if vernal fluidities 

could be enough for the stern assault of fact. 
As if a living ornament, 

light and subject to temporal breezes, 
could be enough to overcome despair, 

that chunk of something solid in the air, 
unmoving, as words repeated are. 

It's not enough to cover despair 
with motion. Motion itself is flawed, 

continuous motion a narrow, thin escape 
from what is rooted. Leaves do sway, 

but in truth, they're only flapping out, 
ancillary, uncertain, buffeted 

this way and that. They remain the fact 
they are bound to, involuntary notions 

victim to the weather of a day, 
gripped by what has thrust between the rocks, 

flexible as everything not rock is, 
reckless as imagining is reckless.





Ladybirds
 

Brilliance is a carcass 
on a snow-white beach. 

Envy never sleeps. 
I tell my children truthfully: 

a long red beard is breaking 
from the darkness scale. 

He's chasing you because 
you're new. Because he's old 

and sees the town in dirty tones: 
violet sheep and wine-dark 

corn. He burns the evening 
rainbow like a wartime bridge 

until it's charred and charlatans 
topple out of robin eggs 

and pox your happy window 
by capturing the ledge 

and chattering like X-rays 
that crash into your flesh.





Kertsz: Latrine
 

1 

Four poilus in a wood austerely shitting. 
Death watches them, laughing, its sides splitting. 

Life is a cry followed by laughter. 
The body before, the waste after. 

                                  2 

Could one hear in that wood the gentle click 
of the shutter like the breaking of a stick 
or the safety catch on its climacteric 

                                  3 

Like the four winds. Like a low fart that rips 
clean air in two, like urine that drips. 
Four squatting footsoldiers of the Apocalypse. 

                                  4 

Kiss them lightly, faint breeze in the small leaves, 
be the mop on the brow, the sigh that relieves. 

Let them dump and move on into the dark plate 
of the unexposed future, too little and too late.





Ross: Children of the Ghetto
 

Love, we were young once, and ran races 
over rough ground in our best shiny shoes, 
we kicked at stones, we fell over, pulled faces. 

Our knees were filthy with our secret places, 
with rituals and ranks, with strategy and ruse. 
Love, we were young once and ran races 

to determine the most rudimentary of graces 
such as strength and speed and the ability to bruise. 
We kicked at stones, we fell over, pulled faces, 

and doing so left no permanent traces 
because we fought and fell only to confuse 
love. We were young. Once we ran races 

in ghettos, in camps, in the dismal spaces 
of the imagination reserved for Jews. 
We kicked at stones, we fell over, pulled faces 

at elastic braces, shoelaces, empty packing cases 
as if they were the expressions we could choose. 
Love, we were young once, and ran races. 
We kicked at stones, we fell over, we pulled faces.





Ross: Yellow Star
 

The eye is drawn to that single yellow star 
that no wise man will follow. 
The hunched men in caps, the grimacing woman 
her eyes screwed up, cheeks hollow. 

We look and look again until we burn a hole 
in the paper. We strive to learn 
from their resignation but it is beyond us. 
We let them burn.





Doisneau: Underground Press
 

Were I to fall in love all over again, it would be 
with this low ceiling, with the calm faces 
of the two men going about their craft, 
and with her, now twisting towards them, 
beautiful, defiant and free. 

Because we forget how beauty was once itself 
and nothing else, how it held its stellar 
moment in attic and cellar. 

Because that is what beauty is, this compact 
with time and the silence of concentration 
on one subversive operation, 

that requires courage and sacrifice 
and never comes without a price.





Sudek: Tree
 

The visionary moment comes 
just as it is raining, just as bombs 
are falling, just as atoms 

burst like a sneeze in a city park 
and enter the dark 
as if it were the waiting ark. 

You open your hand and blow 
the dust. You pick and throw 
the stone. You make the round O 

of your mouth perfect as light 
and the tree bends and stands upright 
in the stolid night.





Petersen: Kleichen and a Man
 

I have seen eternity and it is like this, 
a man and woman dancing in a bar 
in a poor street on an unswept floor. 

It clings and plots and is desperate, 
at a point between violence and abjection, 
between warmth and agoraphobic fear. 

Let me reverse this and accept the fear. 
Let me drop all objections to abjection, 
since life itself is desperate 

and has to tread the unswept floor 
carefully, lovingly, while the bar 
hovers in eternity. Like this.





Kolr: Housing Estate
 

What you cannot see through those windows 
beyond the bare hill 
is the hand resting on the table, 
is the man lying still 
on the bed, is the vague gesture 
of the young woman in the hallway 
as she remembers something that happened yesterday, 
is the mouse hesitating under the draining board, 
is the twelve year old boy putting on a record 
of Wiener Blut that he once saw 
his parents waltzing to. 

All that you see is the all-but-naked child 
on the all-but-naked hill against a naked sky, 
as if what you could not see were the question 
and she the reply.





Full Fathom
 

& sea swell, hiss of   incomprehensible flat: distance: blue long-fingered ocean and its   
                                                                                                 nothing else: nothing in the above visible except   
                                                                                                 water: water and   
always the white self-destroying bloom of   wavebreak &, upclose   
                                                                                                 roil, &

ticking of   stays against empty flagpoles, low tide, free day, nothing   
                                                                                                 being

over the place but not memories any of   us now among the living

The Quarrel
 

If there were a monument   
to silence, it would not be   
the tree whose leaves   
murmur continuously   
among themselves;   

nor would it be the pond   
whose seeming stillness   
is shattered   
by the quicksilver   
surfacing of fish.   

If there were a monument   
to silence, it would be you   
standing so upright, so unforgiving,    
your mute back deflecting   
every word I say.





A Test of Poetry
 

What do you mean by rashes of ash? Is industry 
systematic work, assiduous activity, or ownership 
of factories? Is ripple agitate lightly? Are 
we tossed in tune when we write poems? And 
what or who emboss with gloss insignias of air? 

Is the Fabric about which you write in the epigraph 
of your poem an edifice, a symbol of heaven? 

Does freight refer to cargo of lading carried 
for pay by water, land or air? Or does it mean 
payment for such transportation? Or a freight 
train? When you say a commoded journey, 
do you mean a comfortable journey or a good train 
with well-equipped commodoties? But, then, why 
do you drop the a' before slumberous friend? And 
when you write, in "Why I Am Not a Christian 
You always throw it down / But you never 
pick it up--what is it?? 

In "The Harbor of Illusion, does vein 
refer to a person's vein under his skin or 
is it a metaphor for a river? Does lot 
mean one's fate or a piece of land? 
And does camphor refer to camphor trees? 
Moreover, who or what is nearing. Who or 
what has fell?   Or does fell refer to the 
skin or hide of an animal? And who or what has   
stalled? Then, is the thoroughfare of 
noon's atoll an equivalent of the template? 

In "Fear of Flipping" does flipping mean 
crazy? 

How about strain, does it mean 
a severe trying or wearing pressure or 
effect (such as a strain of hard work), 
or a passage, as in piece of music? 
Does Mercury refer to a brand of oil? 

In the lines 
shards of bucolic pastry anchored 
against cactus cabinets, Nantucket buckets 
could we take it as--pieces of pies 
or tarts are placed in buckets (which 
are made of wood from Nantucket) 
anchored against cabinets (small 
rooms or furniture?) with cactus? 

What is nutflack? 

I suppose the caucus of caucasians 
refers to the white people's meeting 
of a political party to nominate candidates. 
But who is Uncle Hodgepodge? 
And what does familiar freight 
to the returning antelope mean? 

You write, the walls are our floors. 
How can the walls be floors if the floors 
refer to the part of the room which forms 
its enclosing surface and upon which one 
walks? In and the floors, like balls, 
repel all falls--does balls refer to 
nonsense or to any ball like a basket ball 
or to guys? Or to a social assembly for 
dancing? Falls means to descend 
from higher to a lower 
or to drop down wounded or dead? 
But what is the so-called overall 
mesh? 

Is the garbage heap the garbage heap 
in the ordinary sense? Why does 
garbage heap exchange for so-called 
overall mesh? Since a faker is 
one who fakes, how can 
arbitrary reduce to faker? 

Who or what are disappointed 
not to have been? 

Does frames refer to form, constitution, 
or structure in general? Or to a 
particular state, as of the mind? 

In the sentence, 
If you don't like it
colored in, you can always xerox it 
and see it all gray 
--what is it? What does 
colored in mean? 

A few lines later you write, 
You mean, image farm when you've got bratwurst-- 
Does bratwurst refer to sausage? 
Does the line mean--the sausage 
you saw reminded you of a farm which you imagined? 

Does fat-bottom boats refer to boats with thick bottoms? 
Is humble then humped used to describe the actions of one 
who plays golf? In the phrase a sideshow freak-- 
the freak refers to a hippie? Sideshow refers to secondary 
importance? Or an abnormal actor in the sideshow? 
Then, who or what is linked with steam of pink. And 
how about the tongue-tied tightrope stalker-- 
does the stalker refer to one who is pursuing 
stealthily in the act of hunting game? The stalker 
is a witness at first and then a witless witness? 

You write The husks are salted: 
what kind of nut husks can be salted for eating? 
What does bending mean--to become curved, 
crooked, or bent? Or to bow down in submission 
or reverence, yield, submit? Does bells 
refer to metallic sounding instruments or 
a kind of trousers? 

Just a few lines later you have the phrase 
Felt very poured. Who felt poured? Toys? 
Is humming in the sense of humming a song? 
Stepped into where? Not being part of what? 

In "No Pastrami (Walt! I'm with you in Sydney / Where 
the echoes of Mamaroneck howl / Down the outback's 
pixilating corridors)--does the pastrami refer 
to a highly seasoned shoulder cut of beef? Is 
Mamaroneck a place in the U.S. where wild oxes howl? 
I take it corridors refers to the passageway 
in the supermarket? Could I read the poem as-- 
The speaker is doing shopping in a supermarket 
in Sydney; he is walking along the eccentric   
passageways among the shelves on which goods 
are placed; he does not want to buy the pastrami 
as he seems to have heard the echoes of wild oxes 
howling in the U.S. while he addresses Walt Whitman? 

In "No End to Envy, does the envy refer to admire or 
in the bad sense?





Gertrude and Ludwig's Bogus Adventure
 

for Gabriele Mintz
As Billy goes higher all the balloons 
Get marooned on the other side of the 
Lunar landscape. The module's broke-- 
It seems like for an eternity, but who's 
Counting--and Sally's joined the Moonies 
So we don't see so much of her anyhow. 
Notorious novelty--I'd settle for a good 
Cup of Chase & Sand-borne--though when 
The strings are broken on the guitar 
You can always use it as a coffee table. 
Vienna was cold at that time of year. 
The sachertorte tasted sweet but the memory 
burned in the colon. Get a grip, get a grip, before 
The Grippe gets you. Glad to see the picture 
Of ink--the pitcher that pours before 
Throwing the Ball, with never a catcher in sight. 
Never a catcher but sometimes a catch, or 
A clinch or a clutch or a spoon--never a 
Catcher but plenty o'flack, 'till we meet 
On this side of the tune.





Dear Mr. Fanelli,
 

I saw your picture 
in the 79th street 
station. You said 
you'd be interested 
in any comments I 
might have on the 
condition of the 
station Mr. Fanelli, 
there is a lot of 
debris in the 79th street 
station that makes it 
unpleasant to wait in 
for more than a few 
minutes. The station 
could use a paint 
job and maybe 
new speakers so you 
could understand 
the delay announcements 
that are always being 
broadcast. Mr. 
Fanelli--there are 
a lot of people sleeping 
in the 79th street station 
& it makes me sad 
to think they have no 
home to go to. Mr. 
Fanelli, do you think 
you could find a more 
comfortable place for them 
to rest? It's pretty noisy 
in the subway, especially 
all those express trains 
hurtling through every 
few minutes, anyway when the 
trains are in service. 
I have to admit, Mr. Fanelli, I 
think the 79th street station's 
in pretty bad shape 
& sometimes at night 
as I toss in my bed 
I think the world's 
not doing too good 
either, & I 
wonder what's going 
to happen, where we're 
headed, if we're 
headed anywhere, if 
we even have heads. Mr. 
Fanelli, do you think if 
we could just start 
with the 79th street 
station & do what 
we could with that 
then maybe we could, 
you know, I guess, move 
on from there? Mr. 
Fanelli, when I saw your 
picture & the sign 
asking for suggestions 
I thought, if 
you really wanted to 
get to the bottom 
of what's wrong then 
maybe it was my job 
to write to you: Maybe 
you've never been inside 
the 79th street station 
because you're so busy 
managing the 72nd street 
& 66th street stations, 
maybe you don't know 
the problems we have 
at 79th--I mean the 
dirt & frequent 
delays & the feeling of 
total misery that 
pervades the place. Mr. 
Fanelli, are you reading 
this far in the letter 
or do you get so 
many letters every day 
that you don't have 
time to give each 
one the close attention 
it desires? Or am I 
the only person who's 
taken up your invitation 
to get in touch & 
you just don't have enough 
experience to know how to 
respond? I'm sorry 
I can't get your attention 
Mr. Fanelli because I really 
believe if you ask 
for comments then you 
ought to be willing 
to act on them--even 
if ought is too 
big a word to throw 
around at this point. 
Mr. Fanelli 
I hope you won't 
think I'm rude 
if I ask you a 
personal question. Do 
you get out of the 
office much? 
Do you go to the movies 
or do you prefer 
sports--or maybe 
quiet evenings at a 
local restaurant? Do 
you read much, Mr. Fanelli? 
I don't mean just 
Gibbons and like 
that, but philosophy-- 
have you read much 
Hanna Arendt or 
do you prefer 
a more ideological 
perspective? 
I think if I understood 
where you are coming from, 
Mr. Fanelli, I could 
write to you more cogently, 
more persuasively. Mr. 
Fanelli, do you get out 
of the city at all--I 
mean like up to Bear 
Mountain or out to 
Montauk? I mean do you 
notice how unpleasant 
the air is in the 79th 
street station--that we 
could use some cooling 
or air-filtering system 
down there? Mr. 
Fanelli, do you think 
it's possible we 
could get together 
and talk about 
these things in 
person? There are 
a few other points 
I'd like to go over 
with you if I could 
get the chance. Things 
I'd like to talk to 
you about but that 
I'd be reluctant to 
put down on paper. 
Mr. Fanelli, I haven't 
been feeling very good 
lately and I thought 
meeting with you face 
to face might change 
my mood, might put 
me into a new frame 
of mind. Maybe we 
could have lunch? 
Or maybe after work? 
Think about it, Mr. 
Fanelli.

What are aesthetic values and why do 
there appear to be lesser & fewer of 
them? Quick: define the difference

Medley of the Cut
 

The column of the commander yielded to our first sweep.
Even the water jar for our diggers we set on the south wall
of the general's tomb without knowing it. So we began.
His armies retook Nubia, Libya, and the Levant,
lost under the sway-bellied lantern-jawed Sun King.
Overseer of all scribes, Overseer of the priests of Horus,
Grain-giver to all lands, Royal chief of staff, Regent,
the general had himself carried on his palanquin
through the wailing processions
to oversee the work on this place. And so carved, thus:
one of his men punches a Nubian in the face.
The general was low-born; everything had counted
and he knew what counted most.
His platoons lift open palms towards Tutankhamun.
The general towers as a sway-girdled go-between at court
for beseeching Libyans.
Only the pearl-handled revolvers do not figure here,
or the comeback challenge Nuts! in the Ardennes winter forest.
He had himself carried beyond the busy streets of the dead
in the city of the dead sloping back from the bluff
to a higher, private terrace looking across to Memphis.
But then he rose to Pharaoh. So he is not here. Instead
his first wife lay here, and then his queen also.
At his own royal tomb in the Valley, where the designs
remained uncarved, sketching idea along stone,
he does not rest either. The fine picklock hand
got past Anubis and the reared serpents, and got to him,
the Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt. It got past Truth
with her high feather, which moved at the slightest disturbance.
The general did deep obeisance to her. He is not here.

What at last moves the heart?

So much already moved, even in his own century,
architects prying loose mud bricks of the core for new tombs.
Cult funded in perpetuity gone in two generations.
So Coleridge, who was indisposed that day, prudently
remained in the circle of lime trees while his friends went off
on their walk through the countryside. He followed them in his mind.
That way no one would have to dismantle Horeheb's outer court
to secure bricks for the statuary room, and facing stones.
He cast his mind outward, a net over his dear ones,
sending them at pace through the middle distance of steeples,
hill lines, and the murder of Lamb's mother by his sister,
a brief madness, thus through the appropriately middle distance
where such things are built and performed in fact, no closer, no farther,
then on out to the cleansing rim of apocalypse, evening
in the bath of waning fire, one bird stitching
the whole veil of showings tight along its upper hem--
though he was not there, he could tell them that none the less
he was next to his words and his word was with them, even
unto the rim of their wandering and their turning back.
One dome of air and fire. But he was not there. Nor I here.

What removes the heart from what moves it?

As if I were the lecturer before a congress of doctors,
his clinching point approaching, when suddenly he stared out
in silence, and at last said, Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues,
the only thing I can see at this moment inside my brain,
such as it is, is a little white mouse chasing a little white ball.
Their laughter recovered him. But he'd found he was not there.
And Nietzsche smooched the dray horse. Soon, too, he was not there.
Or rather in five places, seeking cartage, and thinking he'd found it.

What removal does not pass through the rippling pump room?

The G.I. whose father had been raised in a Swiss house along
one of the lakes knocked, in uniform, and asked to see it,
and conned the dark-paneled ceilings, and drank Schnapps, and took
photos of the owners. And then he knew he was not there.

Where is the room if it always surrounds you?

An interviewer came to Thomas Mann after the war, from Italy.
The interviewer was a poet. Mann offered him no coffee, and
called him Signor Mountainous. Not there, the poet.

The Riss between body and soul, the ancient killing fields
of Prudentius, Pauline salt poured in the cut, that rift
deeper than the Mariana Trench: these are the gift of all
dualisms, a yawn between detaching spacecraft shooting
over the blue-white swirl betweeen continents. Nicht da,
that separation widening to meters, we see the not-there.

What moves but the heart?

If you wait for the sun to take it at the slant angle,
and if you gaze at his crouched from long enough, then
it will move. At ease on the general's head and fish-like hands
floats the djed column, its foliate
abundance, leafed powers, stemming out to the bud.

He rises beneath it and there is no strain on his face,
valves of space intervene between the stone and his palms,
its basal flare like a parasol shelters him, who under
any other circumstances, in that spot, would be red gristle.
Twelve tons, but chiseled at the requisite depth he goes in
beneath it and rises. Light with him. And he's not there.

Nor are you there, finisher still here and breathing me, though
steadily you intimate such. But paradox is your forte. 
You whose touch lifted this very weight for awhile
pass, fluttering interpreter
of the last things in our tawdry updrafts of the fake,
the last first butterfly. My brothers maintain
that the hot wind is friend, lifter of stones, trembler of heavy
horizons, for they half-remember that for them you vanished
into ripples at the join of sky and dust, until
the column floats only because ther are no longer
aware that they stagger beneath it. And I with them though
I am not here, having been grazed by your wing, its razory mercy.





A Twenty-fourth Poem about Horses
 

 Night deepening, frost leans on the stables
            of thoroughbreds, west wind splitting their hooves.                        --LI HO, Twenty-three Poems about Horses
Steed out of my dusk and a dusk, now, for the species,
veins deltawise down your silky inner thigh,

veins trickling from one eye down the roan cliffside
of a nose vaulted and chanceled for winds of the Pleistocene,

you have come, you paw patiently, that is the main thing,
the fields between stretch wider and we, the restless, are everywhere

save where your nostril quivers, arches, and you snort in the night.
We who debouch into all places dream of you now nowhere.

You come to a woman's hand: that smile. You come to a
child's hand, giggling and shivers. Your hot breath pleasures soldiers.

Harnessed to caisson with bannered coffin, to the barouche
at a state wedding, you are ambassador from the eldest   kingdom.

The King of Brazil sent a forest of teak to pave the streets
girdling the Pantheon, to muffle the clatter you hauled there.

When we spurred you against Wellington's infantry squares,
you side-ran them or reared back. The god of catasrophes took note.

Sad banner you were in the prophecies of Sweet Medicine,
the whiskered whitneys bringing and spawning your manes and tails

among the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Lakota, Kiowa,
your speed between their loins a drumming into decline.

Under Tutankhamun, the generalissimo who rode you hummed
his tenth title: Overseer of Works in the Hill of Gritstone,

while there in those Works among the pulling men pulled also
your brother, sent down because of a freakish temperament.

Muir knew you on both shores, and van der Post knew you,
mufti lords recognizing a lord in service. Nuzzle them both.

They say that Poseidon at Onchestos, breaking you as a colt,
had your driver leap off where the road entered forest,

and watched to see what you'd do, the rig rattling--smash it
against the trunks on the run, or walk it through tall shadows.

Where you linger for shade on the veldt, branches level,
a tree is the only tree. Your water, the only water.

Flickers of hair along your neck's crest release
the only signal. Which staggers from storm cloud to browse oats.

Stubby melted candle, your recessed phallus makes
no howitzer but glistens a coat whose sheen ripples off.

For I imagine that Li Ho, seeing good men misused
as you were, foresaw your withdrawal from our night grasses.

For your standing here re-ordains neither Akhilleus
nor Cuchulain. Dew braids your mane with fresh constellations.

For what shall we make of you, made into goddess, mare
sacrificed but receiving cult also among the footloose

on the steppes: mother ridden by god-spear, great mam thus
captured, cinched, spurred? though your flanks shudder unfettered.

Through mists we flash bits of mirror, but from them
you pound abreast, neither parent, eyes orbing the two sides.

For that demigod's eye, tiding, capsizes anyone
who would turn trainer. And this one goes on into the bond.

A trainer aims at one thing, but what tingles him is force
hinting at the uncontainable, the opponent.

And the top tamers, spook-soothers, the whisperers,
will write their books but miss the appointment. It is not inscribed.

The two   grooms beside you in Hokusai's whitewater cascade
lave you with splashes of it, currying your bulk,

hoisting your nosebag--and no one has set the timer, everywhere
it is one sound, stampede steadied and rocking in it.

Your great-grandparents, unicorn wild asses
from Persia and Scythia, fostered childbirth but also pissed plagues,

the unharnessable summum totium browsing in ocean,
an eye-spangled three-legged mountain. Hell and cloud in your seed!

It was your miniature stature at the beginning, Maria Tallchief
at ten, that wedged you between giants into the straightaway.

And the reindeer modeled from smudge in the Font de Gaume grotto
at Les Eyzies, fading across your body, trails a third antler

like a skater's scarf through your head, broadening out,
a dancer's arm rippling after the total gather.

Looking back from the pass at his mounted escorts, flashing them
three turns back down the corkscrew, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama

saw them slumped on your back, the red of Rahu in splashes
and trickling stillness. And dripping you still awaited their nudges.

In that patience, the kernel of the twister moan-lifting
over Kansas, the shrapnel clatter of your take-off.

Across that aftermath, bubbling through wind-sound or the mind's
rise from its cringe, the flubber-flutter of moody-moodlessness.

So the unforeseen from you opposes the blindly seen in us--
your fuse as a spurter, jump-taker, yet a curb also

to our unsnaffled berserkness.   For the berserking Greek says
that only that ass's horn or hoof, cut off and cupped upward,

can hold any of the cold torrent under the world,
implacable Styx, All else, graces or muons, it crumbles.

And every jot which that flow dissolves, the images
with their assessors, has rolled in us. And you have stood

calmly beside us, your shot breath a bloom in the cold,
your hooves hammers yet also the last and only chalice.

The unreached-for cup, beaker for world-toxin,
breast englobing ground zero. And so we know you not.

And I realize: though I have walked drenched in spring rains
my bare thighs have not hugged your warm bellows in a downpour.

For though your manic tribe is mine, the boreal chargers,
mere rooms, a migrant's mangy stations, have detained me.

For while historians of cultures hot on the spoor of roots among
their root clans have heard you drum past, they looked up only briefly.

For though engravers assumed you would stay, given their way with your
musculature, accoutrements, wavy harness, tip-toe grooms,

gear draped over your cruppers like an evening gown, its ratios
and metalwork continuous with Genghis Khan's and a jockey's,

their inky mastery frames cosily misleading questions:
which posthouse this evening, what pasture tomorrow?

Whereas you inquire into rupture and the unfenced: what thunder
between flesh and ground, what surge from the cells even past sundown?





Natal Command
 

    1.
Cross-hatchings, palm and rain,
    clapboard faded
to the grain, half-shutters
    open to old vines and mangroves

draining their own shadows;
    recollecting what the body knows
suspended between coral
    and shifting images of cloud ...


       After death,
       after the knowledge
       of death,
       his death, 


       his face, unwrapped,
       already yellowed,
       papery, recovered
       with a small white cloth


       then lowered away
       and shut to the earth;

       So pierced,
       so mute,
       these words
       re-opening:

       
       Not this.



    2.
The rain had gone. I swam against the current,
harnessed by water till I turned and swung
out with the tide, shouldering deep

into a rhythm of my own, long strokes
pulled under the body and returning
past the glinting crease in which I breathed,

the sea half-woken like another body
bedded into sheer transparency,
the outer reaches granular with light.

Comebacks. Chains of radiance.
Far more than meet the eye.

What do they meet then, intimate
but otherworldly, mimicking the world?


    I looked back at the land's thin edge,
pines along the shoreline near a fort

where cannons rust, mouths left open among
thistleweed around the dozing moat.

Far back among fallen needles, pigeons shuffle
through shade, their feathers iris underlight,
soft flares bob the dark.

                                       The land had disappeared.
The sun had followed it. From either wrist,
half-mingled with my breath into the night,

a trail of ungloved phosphor travelled back.



    3.
Sounds too have their surfaces:

                                                within
the mortal frame, particles of blood
revolve as in a sort of heaven where

breath moves through us as an unseen light;
but when the marrow bonds are parted they in turn
set loose what has been called the soul ...

the spill and friction
glancing like a coin within a sea of coins;

my left hand pulls through as I breathe,
the right recovers, elbow in the air,

until the will behind the will strikes--
pike-flash in a swerving current,
predatory bird.



    After death--his voice,
    that constellation
    shining out--

    his face, his eyes--

    as each had been, now
    gone. Or going on,
    a ghost--another way 



    4.
A slanting chop.
                              Erratic gasps
between thick chunks of water

crowded through the night.

The unclogged screw
    of a propellor

ringing into fossil-drillings,

detonantions, manacles--

          (the jangled
       monkey-chain above his bed;

    he clung with both hands
       to the small trapese,
    his lower body paralyzed
       for months ...

                        not this)--


       far larger than myself,
          a shambling hulk,

            tentacular, a pulpy
       helmet, lantern eyes,
          the huge mouth gorging,

         undigested corpses
             bulging in the belly wall.
       I thrashed to break free

             but the ocean held me,
       and a slap of water broke
          across my mouth.



    5.Natal Command 
Troughs of recollection; hands now two numb sponges,
and a cold ache pressed into the spine.

A conscript leaning on my rifle, I stood guard for hours
staring through wire toward the Blue Waters Hotel:

an all-night crew, unreal, flourescent
polished the lobby floors; high in a yellow cell

black shadows rippled on drapes until the lights went out.
The sentry's solitude. The muffled crump of surf

beyond the esplanade; the ocean shifting
to an onshore drowse of salt over the palm trees and camp.

A palm rat slithers through rotten fronds.
The mind floats imageless.

Then back to footage of commandos stalking a sentry
from behind--the pounce, a hand clamped hard

over the mouth, the blade thrust in, the sagging weight set down,
a clutch to save the helmet as it drops to gravel, quick

hand signals to shadows hunched behind. One night while
still on guard I crept into an empty tent and fell asleep.

The duty sergeant found me--legs stuck out beneath the flap.
He held my rifle. Prodded the bayonet at my spine,

Keep sleeping and they'll kill us all, he whispered
as the bayonet found the nerve, pain jolting

to my hands and feet.His boot beside the blade
he pumped me hard against the ground then let me up,

my limbs still trembling, the uniform stuck bloody to my back.



    6.
                   When does it begin,
submission sliding into savagery--
the reptile mind among its enemies

revenged and striking--bayonet
driven deep into the bag,

the rifle stock slammed home,
the scream in my own mouth?


                     A guard dog chained
against the fence.
The collar chokes it back.



    7.
When I was eight our Latin master had us stand beside him
while he marked our work. The desk concealed us below

the waist and he'd reach up our shorts to run his hand
along the inside of our thighs. Shift or step away

he'd growl Stand still! or Pay attention, boy!
as if his fondling were the lesson.


Sacks-and-bags he called me; and one afternoon, my eyes
fixed on an ink stain at my feet, the wood floor rocking

like a ship--navis, navem--willing myself out of it,
out of the room, out of the body, swaying in the heat

but also silken, wondering, astray, near fainting
as the nausea heaved--I threw up on his head.

A half-digested avocado in a mess of milk. Fumbling
for his handkerchief he wiped his face, his scalp,

his glasses, Alright Sacko never mind; can you get down
to sick bay on your won or should I send the Bishop with you?


Walking home I stopped to watch a line of men work on the road.
They swung their pickaxes in unison, the sun caught flashing

as they poised axe heads for a moment overhead, then with
a slow arc slammed them down into the asphalt crust:

overalls stripped to the waist, cloth arms dangling
near their legs, they chanted out what may have been a long

insult against the foreman, the umlungu, lounging, shirt
unbuttoned, pale belly gleaming in the shade. The work song

hoisted, held mid-phrase, the weight of it, then driven
with a hard expulsion of breath into the ground.



    8.
The will is broken,
realigned, then broken further,

burning like another
spine within the spine.

A sentry-spy,
it stalks us from behind.

The sunken path emerges
not as feeling nor as thought

but as the mind itself,
historical, embodied, and alive.



    9.
                           Forgotten nights,

the shuck and wash of tides,
entangled shadows of the burglar guards

sent wriggling on the blanket as I stirred there
sleepless, sickened by the swirling

mind lured outward into unknown pleasures
swarming back against the fear

of punishment, of being maimed,
of others' injuries ...


       Bright red, page after page,
my father's medical thesis,
                                          my fingers
pressing small black corners
into which he slid the photographs,

the gloss unbuckling,
                              Now look away 

(I was no more than five), but what I saw
each time if only for a second, stares at me:


More than naked--
cut apart or sewn;
encrusted. Swollen,
unkown organs
sectioned off
but spilling into
sight--
unframed.


Enormous.
More than any body
could be made to bear.


It was a drowning agony,
compassion sinking
into anger, shame, disgust,
resurging with each later shock

                     --the dead flesh
grafted on a classmate's arm
held close against my face
until I hunched down pleading
for release;


                        the veteran on the bus,
half-seen, then fully seen,
a boiled mask stretched tight
and welded to the head;


    the sugar-worker's hand
   crushed by the mill--a red
stump held up to the car,
blood on the lowering glass.

       No other way. 

       As through a single
       wound ripped past
       all dressing--

       reaching further in



    10.
We tried to bathe him, dabbing,
sponging as he crouched above
the bathroom floor;

then carried him,
                        but weakly,
terrified to grip too hard,
new fractures in the shoulders,
skin like tissue tearing


in my hands--

            a slow nightmarish
stumble to the bed,
he almost slipping free.


Never so powerless,
exchanging that one glance.

The stuff between us acrid,
clogging, unexpungeable

as he lay back, Thanks boy, 
against the bloodied sheet.

No other words beside the pulsing,
mortal, mortal, mortal, mortal. 



    11.
Above a splotch of green far down against the wrinkled
blue--but nothing under me no wing no craft no seat

only flapping pages of The Mercury on which I squatted
knowing if I clutched I'd fall but grabbing as the papers

tore and lofted and I fell back to the water rushing
at me--following the dream through schools of eels

lampreys hagfish one-eyed flounders polyps nameless
weeds descending fathom after fathom to a buried apex

body taken up into the mind impacted grinding
through the ocean bed into the core--a drill bit

whirling every splinter bone chip ion of the self
disintegrating through a blowhole into nothingness

the water sucked away the air evacuated and the thought 
of any form--face shoulders torso pelvis legs--



    12.
How long could it have been before the thickening
of spine and brain, the   limbs' recovered
grappling through old fears, old anger

buried in the reef, whole chunks ripped upward
clinging to the arms, the rusted throat worked loose,
a still unbroken grief approaching as for air?

As ripples move across a pool before there is a pool,
so after nothing that I could perceive, an origin
of light moved out into another version of itself

and I was driven with it to a vertical horizon--
wall or contour of a high inhuman skull, opaquely veined,
through which I saw a river branching into cataracts.

Light beaten into sound, sound blown and beaten into light,
a river-tree held up between its planetary leaves
huge cysts and spores of darkness casting out

bright shocks that spiralled to the widest
units of the wall. The force reverberated through
all sheathing, drawing elemental shapes out of the field

where they stirred, magnetic, crystalline,
the salt and grains of dust converging into gravity
around me, rotated and gathered toward the shore.



    13.
         Continuance,
    the measure of 
         continuance;

         gray shell,
    blood-red anemone,
         my hands,

         my shoulders,
    found, resumed,
         permissible. 

         Re-oriented
    oarings; sifted
         semi-tropic

         scatterings,
    unsearched
         till now

         contending,
    charged with
         gravity

         (once more),
    remorseless
         from the broken

         cell--no
    reason in but
         of the law,

         too many
    particles
         (it was no

         offering)
    to pronounce
         in time.



    14.
(from the Train, near Anzio, Veterans Day 1994)


Out of the body comes intelligible speech,
but from such wordlessness as if the body
were the world. Leaning out, my hand

against the sill, I watched wild poppies flare
along the track, the cinders whispering here they are,
they are...too many to be held in sight,

red poppies blurring out of recollection,
seeping back, reopened, flattened to crepe
petals pinned against our uniforms in school.

The shallow pride of decorations worn
against my terror even at photographs
of war; seen once, a Life or Look left open

to a soldier blasted to a ragged mess.
For years when I went up alone to bed
he ambushed me: across the darkened landing,

left arm flailing, right crammed down
against the entrails, head torn open,
mouth near-gone and one eye left to stare

fast glazing out the last thing it would see,
my own hand scrabbling up the wall toward
the light switch that would blank him out.

What did I fear beyond the quick blood-soaked
immersion through the living and the dead--
as if by diving through a single swell

I could resurface out behind the lines,
a momentary calm in which another
wave returns still higher, thicker, lunging

overhead from the horizon--crying out--
so that I press my hand over the shattered
mouth, our bodies wrestle intertwined,

his writhing under mine, a swirl of weed,
red fish, red blossoms gathered, mounded,
breaking into flight then gathering again

until at last remaining what it was
--the human form, no more no less
however torn, opposing everything:

Control yourself and listen. All you know
is words, the other than. Why do you think
your father never spoke of it? Can you imagine

what it's like to watch a thousand sheep
stampeded through a minefield into enemy fire;
then stumbling across the field yourself,

haystacks burning, blood and chaos everywhere,
you hear your friend yell, Watch your hairnet
dearie! then his head explodes beside you


in a splash of brains and hair the bloody
muck over your mouth your eyes your ears?
--I answered nothing. Neither death

nor dying but my own body's own first
certainty of butchery had ruptured
through me: my life against his own,

against his life and death to which
no word, no year of words could count
for more than an evasion pressing back

toward an image of the dead recovered,
grappled, conjured into life
--or banished wholly out of mind.

I knew there'd be no end to this betrayal.
The same aftershock by which he vanished
rippled now behind my eyes, and through the words

your mouth your eyes your ears the bloody muck 
and through each breath itself until
these too rushed backward with the track,

the stones, the cinders, the unnumerable poppies
bending back and shaken as we passed.

More about this poem






Night Ferry
 

Blood-drop, lung of fire setting past
the sea bell and wave; why am I separate
from that giant burrowing into further life?

The body breathes and rides
a heavy-netted ocean swollen 
by the tide. Under the half-moon

it's the lighthouse light that turns
the rest of me to early nightfall,
headland, home. I send it back,

a mirrored flickering across cold waters.
We allow ourselves the crest that breaks
above the surface then re-forms.

We make it human and we call it love.
This wintering is my own and not the world's,
although the world is wintering.





The Work
 

 for my father
               1. Today

Today, this moment, speechlessly in pain,
He fights the terror of being poured out,
The fall into darkness unquenchably long
So that even as he hurtles he keeps holding

Back like a dam the flood overtops--but nothing now
Can stop that surge, already he swirls
To the source of Voices, the many throats inside the one
Throat, each swallowing the unstoppable flood ...

And as if that, all along, were what he'd wanted,
He hears the Voices begin to die down
The way a marsh in spring pulsing and shrilling
Sunup to sundown falls gradually still

--Unappeasable, the silence that will follow
When his every last drop has been poured out.


               2. Countdown

In your hospital bed, the plastic mask across
Your face siphoning air into your lungs,
You lie helpless as an astronaut
Blasting into space: Eyes oblivious

To ours, your body's fevered presence
Shimmers like the phantom heat that will trail
Up the pipe of the crematory oven:
How distant we will seem after

Such intensity ... We drift in your stare
Like the dust stirred by the cow your parents
Gave you as a boy to teach responsibility.

Already you are space immeasurable
By your slide rule, your graphs that plotted
Payload, liftoff, escape velocity.


               3. Prayer

In the house of the dead I pace the halls:
The walls, collapsing, stretch away in desert
Or flatten into horizonless ocean.
I step outside, the door clicking shut

Comforting in its finality ...
Now I see the house as if I looked down
From far off mountains, and saw you crouching in
The sun-scoured yard, eyes keenly focused,

Pupils narrowing to a cat's green slits:
I can't look you in the face, you see only
The openness of sky rising above mountains.

(Only after the world had emptied
You and filled you with its openness
Will I feel the love I pray to feel?)


               4. The God

                                 a dream 

A warming pulsing flood like blood surging through
Veins, and now the god stirs in my hands
Dull as stone in this gravity-less Nowhere.
Sensation shivering through me, deliberate and sure,

I cradle you, I sponge you clean
As if you were my son, the emptiness you
Drink like heavy black milk erasing
Your wrinkles and gouged lines of pain.

The god bends me to the work, my fingers driven
By the god, blinded by the god's
Neutrality, until I pull apart the threads
In this place the god commands:

Face wholly unwoven, without heart, mind, you
are nothing in my hands but my hands moving.


               5. His Stare

Absently there in a moment of pure being
He sits in his chair, eyes locked, staring:
The air's transparence gains solidity
From his looking; while his emaciated features,

The way his flesh sags from sharpening cheekbones,
Make the summer air weigh like marble on the harsh green
Of the trees he is too weak to prune.
And yet the contemplative distance he is sealed in

Projects with ferocious purpose the will of his body
To withdraw into this eerily removed contemplation
Like one who has heard a tuning fork ringing
And enters and becomes each spectral vibration;

So utterly absorbed that love is a distraction; even
The world, its barest colors, bleeding away before that stare.


               6. The Current

The numbing current of the Demorol
Sweeps him out to sea where the secret night
He lives in slowly begins to darken,
His daytime routine of watching his blood cycle

Through the tubes of a machine shadowed by blackness
Blinding as an underwater cave. Already
He filters the dark water through gills aligned
To strain that element he more and more resembles:

Like walls of water held in miraculous
Suspension, the moment of his death looms impartially
Above him, my hands holding his tightening
Its grip even as his hand loosens ...

As if my hand could lead him past that undulating
Weight towering above us out of sight.


               7. The Rehearsal

I lead you back, your Orpheus, until you
Stand inhaling, on the topmost stair,
The rank rich air of breathing flesh--
But like fumes rising from earth's molten core

The voices of the dead reach out to you,
Your whispering parents, dead for forty years,
Entreating me to turn--and so I
Turn, as must you: Your footsteps die,

You dwindle, blur into unfillable
Space echoing like the dark of a cathedral ...
But there is no dark, no stair, no Orpheus

--Only this voice rehearsing breath
By breath in words you'll never read these
Lines stolen from your death.





A Visit
 

What she is waiting for never arrives
or arrives so slowly she can't see it:
         Like the river
         bluing silver

and wearing minutely deeper into its channel,
the flow hardens to carved stone as she fidgets
         beneath the whirling fan
         impatient for the train

that rocks us above the water to arrive:
Her sisters and brothers gone, she ventures alone
         through sunlight
         and moonlight

weaving shadowy faces across the peeling walls...
--Speeding toward her, is it you and me she spies
         in the trembling train
         windows while the engine

hauls us down rails that swerve under wheels
rolling through her brain? Faces burn
         through dirty glass,
         smears of lips and eyes

dissolve to spots of darkness swarming between
her eyes so that swaying apartment towers
         crumble as her nostrils
         prickle from the landfill's

ammonia that hangs above the stacked, crushed cars.
The rails that take us to her pass boxcar after boxcar
         like the successive selves we are
         as she dreams us coming closer,

switching track to track: Now the super unbolts
her door as she calls: Oh is it really you?
         --the wheel's rolling
         through her head bringing

us face to face with raveled bandages, crutches
leaned in dusty corners, terraced mountains of
         yellowing newspaper.
         Framed above her chair

a picture of a prairie sprawls round a covered wagon
and the horse she rode as a girl, her eyes
         fading points of light...
         Again she calls out

above the train's approaching rumble: Is it you at last?
My eyes have got so bad peoples' faces
         are all blurry...Now
         tell me, is it really you?

But already the rails are switching, bearing
our waving hands away at the speed of thought
         over the stony waters that
         ceaselessly pour out.





The Meadow
 

Across the road from where we nap
under a dead elm dazzles the meadow
where the partisans strung the traitors up,

the meadow which their dangling shadows stain.
Belly up in vines a blasted tank
rusts flake by flake to lichened scrap iron

while horseflies harangue
the rippling green, July
a limbo of quavering yellow...

We wake to cattle lowing at dawn,
grass overgrowing summer--so like us
in love each hour with the noonday sun

that neither toils nor spins, its brightness
hovering, blinding us...
What would the dead say if they could see us,

lounging, talking, peering through brambles
at cemetery photographs sunk beneath
the undertow of milkweed shadows,

death dates smoothing back into the stone?
I think of Goya's demon, old man flesh
hanging from his bones, long teeth bared in

an ass's grin as he scrawls on a schoolboy's
slate, What more can be done? Nothing... 
while behind him a noose etched clean as

the moon rises through the inkblot
spiraling back into the hanged man's mouth
as if blackness poured from his throat:

When will you tire of us bogeymen,
caricatures of your father's war,
our crimes half-forgotten, unforgiven?

All future blotted out when they hauled us
from our beds, our minds went dead
to everything but fear: Nightshirts

soaked in snowlight's pall, we hunched in mud, each step
loud, too loud beside the farmhouse wall,
the seconds teetering till we drop...

What our betrayals were we know
with a knowledge intimate beyond revenge,
history the needle's eye you can't squeeze through.

The partisans cut us down, heaped us
in a mass grave our relatives dug up: Yes,
there were tears--even for us...

Now, like aliens from space on your TV shows,
we ravel into mist, surrounding
you the moment your eyes close...

Our pupils search out yours from behind
the mirror with your father's stares,
fathers and sons melding in one mind--

but who are you to call us traitors, an outsider
judging through the smoke-haze of home:
Each blow exact, our own neighbors

beat us till the blood ran, beat us black
and blue...Even now, would they dare take us back,
older, wiser, necks broken by the yoke?

Moving in time as to a dance we buzz
and swarm across the meadow, dissolving
and glinting like fireflies in the hedge,

blown like milkweed in the moon's wall eye.
But under your lids, you see us locked in cold,
shattered wheatstraw flecked in ice:

Chill as the night air on your sunburned neck
our eyes like X rays pierce the frost,
stalking every step the living take.





Matins
 

I 

I've felt undeserving. I've made myself ill with the glory, 
in the unleavened garden 
disgorged the lies and scared away with a stick a snake. 
What made me cover that which I could not have? 

I've grieved and walked in catacombs, 
I've felt undeserving. I've made myself ill with the glory. 
Even the falling leaves gesture their renunciation. 
I disgorge the lies and abhor the serpent's hiss. 

I remember seasons, things I bring from far away, 
and grieve. I walk in catacombs. 
In gardens now, by the stone walls, sunlight closes, 
the falling leaves gesture their renunciation. 

I remember being in a field touching a man's body. 
I remember seasons, things I bring from far away 
and things that hold their breath for shame. 
His skin was soft as a girl's and he closed his eyes. 

I placed apple petals on his eyelids; 
we were lying in a field and I touched his body. 
Then there were clouds, an uncanny silence, 
as when in a green place the air holds its breath for shame. 

What made me covet what I could not have? 
Ill with the power and glory, a thrashing in my chest, 
I remember the unleavened gardens, 
petals falling singly, the yellow snake disgorging lies. 


II 

I've grieved and walked in catacombs. 
I've felt undeserving. I've made myself ill with the glory, 
power and glory-- 
a thrashing in my rib cage. 

I've gone into the unleavened spring garden, 
disgorged the lies, 
and scared away with a stick a snake. 
I've grieved and walked in catacombs. 

What made me cover that which I could not have? 
I've felt undeserving. In this bright land 
that changes from yellow to green and back to yellow, 
I remember seasons, things I bring with me from far away 

and things that hold their breath as if for shame. 
I've made myself ill with the power and glory. 
I've gone into the unleavened garden 
and startled a yellow snake 

disgorging lies. A thrashing in my rib cage. 
What made me cover what I could not have? 
I remember   seasons. Things that hold their breath for shame. 
Things I bring with me from far away. 


III 

I've made myself ill with the power and glory. 
I've made myself ill with the power and glory.





Waking
 

It was dusk, the light hesitating 
and a murmer in the wind, when the deer, exhausted, 
turned to look at me, an arrow in its side. 

Though I pity dreamers, taking a thread 
and weaving it upon the loom of Self--the secret, 
gaudy, wonderful new cloth--, I will tell the end of the story. 

His shoulder was torn, the joint held by one sinew, 
which I severed with the blade of the arrow, 
so when he ran there were no impediments. 

The black dogs that followed were swifter, 
their barking ancient, despicable. 

As he fell, his chest turned to breastplate, 
his one powerful arm covered with pagan signs. 

Nearly stupid in my waiting for what would happen next, 
each breath propelling me and him toward dust, 
I woke, the sheets soaked, heart fluttering--: 

When death comes into the sleeping room as through a tiny hole, 
like a rent in the Covenant, it hurts.





All Summer Long
 

The dogs eat hoof slivers and lie under the porch. 
A strand of human hair hangs strangely from a fruit tree 
like a cry in the throat. The sky is clay for the child who is past 
being tired, who wanders in waist-deep 
grasses. Gnats rise in a vapor, 
in a long mounting whine around her forehead and ears. 

The sun is an indistinct moon. Frail sticks 
of grass poke her ankles, 
and a wet froth of spiders touches her legs 
like wet fingers. The musk and smell 
of air are as hot as the savory 
terrible exhales from a tired horse. 

The parents are sleeping all afternoon, 
and no one explains the long uneasy afternoons. 
She hears their combined breathing and swallowing 
salivas, and sees their sides rising and falling 
like the sides of horses in the hot pasture. 

At evening a breeze dries and crumbles 
the sky and the clouds float like undershirts 
and cotton dresses on a clothesline. Horses 
rock to their feet and race or graze. 
Parents open their shutters and call 
the lonely, happy child home. 
The child who hates silences talks and talks 
of cicadas and the manes of horses.





The Fearful Child
 

As a child I parleyed with animals, stuffed and real. 
Making my kitten pilot of a boot, I guided 
from one end of a string the dizzy flight and collapse. 
I was fearful of people as well as things, 
and my faithful toy shepherd with his painted face 
sat by me on the bed in the gloom. 
I was disdainful of dolls as weak people. 

In the favorite story I told myself my parents 
were made over into fair-limbed, brave angels 
who smiled into their god's eyes when summoned. 
I was benevolent, afraid to let go of this image 
at night because I couldn't hide deep enough 
under the covers to be overlooked by death, 
the angel bending over me who had been wronged. 

I read histories of queens, regal and barbarian, 
whose leopard's eyes restrained man or wild beast. 
I rambled along tidal rivers and in the marshes 
where the green-golden grasses dazzled the sun, 
and felt the ache of sea-air in my lungs. 
I saw water spume near Atlantic cliffs. 
I examined lichen. I saw great light drown darkness. 

Then at thirteen I lay in the bleak bed before sleep 
and heard the pleadings and the murderous kisses; 
and burned, like a bear his fat, my soul. 
I quaked at the sound of my voice whispering, No, 
or turned my face to the wall 
and wept salt onto my knuckles. 

In the serene light of sun-up, before sparrows 
tumbled up from the earth, whispering and singing, 
and the exquisite sea and sky mobilized 
their heavy, blue currents, I was consoled. 
I walked through beauty without knowing why 
and told no one, wanting nothing else to touch me 
and never to move anyone in any way. 

I hid away from the house and learned the dark 
was not a dream but could show the pale gravel 
of a real driveway. I saw for the first time 
later the new moon and the full moon 
in one piece. I no longer feared the night, 
night like a bear at ease in his wide habitat. 
In the greatness of such space I said, This is me.





To Kill a Deer
 

Into the changes of autumn brush 
the doe walked, and the hide, head, and ears 
were the tinsel browns. They made her. 
I could not see her. She reappeared, stuffed with apples, 
and I shot her. Into the pines she ran, 
and I ran after. I might have lost her, 
seeing no sign of blood or scuffle, 
but felt myself part of the woods, 
a woman with a doe's ears, and heard her 
dying, counted her last breaths like a song 
of dying, and found her dying. 
I shot her again because her lungs rattled like castanets, 
then poked her with the gun barrel 
because her eyes were dusty and unreal. 
I opened her belly and pushed the insides 
like rotted fruit into a rabbit hole, 
skinned her, broke her leg joints under my knee, 
took the meat, smelled the half-digested smell 
that was herself. Ah, I closed her eyes. 
I left her refolded in some briars 
with the last sun on her head 
like a benediction, head tilted on its axis 
of neck and barren bone; head bent 
wordless over a death, though I heard 
the night wind blowing through her fur, 
heard riot in the emptied head.





Anasazi, Ancient Enemies
 

I rubbed wax crayon against blowing paper. 
From the rock face footed a dancer white through red. 
    My family gave me over 
    to it, gone for the river. 

Were I a peasant harvesting grapes near Beaune 
in the last century, even, I might have dreamed 
    a saint lifting off for Arles, 
    Les Saintes Maries de la Mer, 

and knowing about cannon in that long peace, 
might have been troubled therefore that my flier 
    hauled a magnum of the best 
    and bloodied the west sky with it 

and vanished. My fisting that loose sheet in place 
was secretarial, not visionary! 
    Already in that decade 
    small tribes entered the void 

like windows on a skyscraper when the bent 
janitor makes his way. But those flick back on 
    each night, costly difference. 
    It is not only portents 

in dream or flapping images of the gone 
or the soon-to-be-going or the tremblingly poised 
    that catch like undertow 
    the foot in tide-rip toeing 

down the singing or remembered beach. 
We study populations in the forests, 
    we hold the paper flat, 
    mark, note, warn--the dictated 

prophecies do their work, we do some work-- 
cut horn from rhinos so they won't be poached. 
    But, to go on from there, 
    one needs to stand in the doorway 

some evening and feel the air as if it were fire 
pulling illusionlessly, letting the draw 
    of one fact heat its chain 
    of links, such as, Japan 

clear-cutting forests in Siberia 
where tigers not already harvested 
    lope their dwindling range, 
    two hundred as the hinge 

for their growled arc of existence, bones of the others 
ground to powders for old men's potencies. 
    One needs to feel the tug 
    of the draft on skin, the drag 

of process utterly anciently itself. 
Faster, now, the pull is from birth through dwelling through 
    dissolution, along lines 
    streaming through us, ageless winds.





Little Fugue
 

An apple paring 
curled from the knife wetly 
    down my thumb-- 
and what I had failed 
to do rightly touching that life 
    next to mine, wearing 
late afternoon's numb 
luminosity, impaled me. 

    A hunter knee-deep 
in salt marsh, whom Anton Chekov 
might have set there and then left, 
    back to doctoring, 
or choked off as too dark, wanton, 
    met the steep 
flailing of teal, trailed their shrill lift, 
but stood only, hearing them. 

    Pouring the last tea 
of an evening, dark amber 
alive, breathing in quintessence 
    of India, 
I felt limber bark 
sheathing the shrub of my life's tree 
with root good, but dense, 
dark, local, raw there, 

    and so in dark woke, 
the seeing doctor, two simple 
profiles of linked characters 
    in his air, 

cruel, good, a pair ample, true 
across that split yoke, 
true to its splayed force-- 
simple so rare, though.





Frre Jacques, Frre Antoine
 

At a bus stop in Arles a fellow wounded in the Last War 
winced into sunlight: Oui, they are beating the drums against 
les juifs again, and the Moors. France is an old man! 
An old pink thing lacking one eye, with his good one he gazed 
through and past me to something which held his interest 
and at which, after a silence not uncomfortable, he smiled. 
Were I to tell this to acquaintances they would brand him senile. 

Below a ridge in the Drme, a goatherd huddled in mists. 
His little carboniferous eyes glinted. He was not clean. 
A kid bucked and sprang. I asked him how long a goat lives. 
He stared, shrugged, and up the slope of wonder intoned, 
Who knows? 
            I asked how many in his herd, and discussed income. 
I started to turn over figures in my alien mind, doing 
sums and multiples on his eighty head, with calvings pyramiding 
upward through geometric promise. He watched me. 
He knew what I was thinking, and what I was going to propose. 
Monsieur, he chuckled, NO one needs more than eighty goats! 
And were I to relate this t0 the literati, they'd call it anecdote.





From the Headland at Cumae
 

People expected that the evil would finally drain away. --Aleksander Wat, My Century
Faded and baked here to a tawny grit, 
spills of blood and seed from humanity 
called from it for its crimes against mute earth 
gully in footpaths, dribble down to the sea, 
payment now and forever drawn from birth 
through flesh's sunny darkness. Light yeasts in it. 

And if I find the slope to crumbled temples 
of that light's god dragging at me through heat, 
shallow degrees of slant up to remnant stone, 
then something more than burnt air, or the repeat 
of weight known as time, pulls heavily in this zone, 
something the bone brings, terrible through simple. 

Phoibos, slayer at distances with shock, 
sower of plague and arrower of healing, 
tension of bright-dark beyond spanning, love 
will not quite cast out evil while revealing 
your fissionables. The raven was your dove. 
Heavy isotopes hum with crickets in rock. 

Neither woman nor man, my driver laughed 
when his lights torched writhings down the far shoulder, 
cross-dresser in the night beyond Naples, huge, 
sinuous, crooning as we shot past. Life seems older 
in its variant forms, drawn by the centrifuge 
to the rim and swinging, swayed in time's dream uncalfed. 

For the vast thrower, shafter of quivering force, 
sex was filigree in whoever served. 
Pythoness, yes, wombed keeper of those coils 
in the wet cellar where tongue darted and swerved. 
But her own throat when it swelled with voice knew toils 
past a man's strength, torqued bulging from the source. 

And that young man fitted with bone and thong 
and membrane from his withers by his father 
the maze molder, when he climbed into flame 
itself in the high nucleus, dripped as slather 
down the sky's maw. Union there, with an aim 
at the center, crisped on a central soundless gong, 

sizzling from his overreach extended 
back on itself and down, the soundless hurry 
of the sea far below minutely riven, 
trembling in place, diamonds in blue slurry 
nowhere disturbed yet flecking everywhere, driven-- 
all this boy's cry endlessly thin, suspended. 

The sybil when at last her throat disgorged 
its burdens rumbled like a pawing bull, 
or the bull-fiend on Krete, and shrilly warbled. 
Birds ride the bull's hump in stone graphs, that full 
barbarity at poise piercing now the garbled 
clang of Ikaros, over us tensile and forged. 

This is the crumbling whistle of shells and frags 
in their close arc. Philosophy gets precise 
when it turns practical. This in our background whir. 
Archimedes, old Fermi in your eyes, 
naked, ecstatic with theorems that assure 
conclusion, your city falls, your hacked flesh sags. 

There was a sprig which, if you bore it in hand 
on landing here, your pilot drowned and your herald 
crushed in the surf, would bend and seem to listen-- 
there was a branch that trailed her voice through imperiled 
corridors to throats of the dead, and glistened, 
then brought you back to your breath near shining sand. 

And there was pelt from the solar scavenger, 
its blond mane tossing with your workings, turning 
catastrophe to triumph, lion crud 
strewn now on waves, coat of the charger burning 
obsidian cobalt platinum and mud 
in craters of the shaker and avenger. 

Eroded skull of this squat promontory, 
nubbled shrine over cave by surf hypnotized 
before deeps enameled with fire's mosaic, 
you are the structure lucid though pulverized 
behind the logics, and the omens prosaic 
in their spelling out, and the blaze of story. 

Give me your light! I am the darkened thing 
seeking it. Give me your fire and your cry! 
But hood me from sulfurs she inhaled when she twisted 
over the fissure, give me your hand from the sky 
we have fallen into. Give, yes, what you insisted 
she utter, rasped uncoilings of your spring! 

And then release me to the animal 
shy of speech yet steady in ecstasies, 
your cousin the outsider's gaze through life, 
the drink of it down, and finally mind as frieze 
eternally in metamorphic strife 
released, sea stone and cloud infinitely small. 

And there the migrant and his wanderers 
may find the new land, and their future wars 
may roll, exhausted in hissing foam, to sink 
over the fish spines, and the blunderers 
of fulfillment stare at samsaric wink 
of ocean, stare and find sleep that dissolves the curse.





The Difficulty with a Tree
 

          
          A woman was fighting a tree. The tree had come to rage at the woman's attack, breaking free from its earth it waddled at her with its great root feet.          Goddamn these sentiencies, roared the tree with birds shrieking in its branches.          Look out, you'll fall on me, you bastard, screamed the woman as she hit at the tree.          The tree whisked and whisked with its leafy branches.          The woman kicked and bit screaming, kill me kill me or I'll kill you!           Her husband seeing the commotion came running crying, what tree has lost patience?          The ax the ax, damnfool, the ax, she screamed.          Oh no, roared the tree dragging its long roots rhythmically limping like a sea lion towards her husband.          But oughtn't we to talk about this? cried her husband.          But oughtn't we to talk about this, mimicked his wife.          But what is this all about? he cried.          When you see me killing something you should reason that it will want to kill me back, she screamed.           But before her husband could decide what next action to perform the tree had killed both the wife and her husband.          Before the woman died she screamed, now do you see?          He said, what...? And then he died.
        




A Love Letter
 

          
          Dear Miss, First of all I want to say that I have enjoyed the imaginary possibility, built of course on the fact that such possibility does exist in nature: I have seen the birds and other forms of nonhumanity occur in such postures that must be with men and women....I have imagined myself in such postures with you, where flight was discouraged only by the inherent possibility of the firm horizontal...          As men give vast lands to little papers with line and color, I have imagined more on the surface of your body, giving all the universe in this model....          Yet, I must be curious about your breasts...curious...hungry is the word, to see, to touch, to taste....I am curious as to how your hands undress your body.          I am interested in your mind: will you undress in front of me? Will you permit me the unparalleled pleasure of taking your clothes off?          I feel that if I should have my penis in your vagina I should have your love; for you do not receive the wretched hardness of my desire into the sweet body of yourself without that you have not come to love me for reasons, if love has reasons, I cannot tell....           Your admirer
        




The Adventures of a Turtle
 

          
          The turtle carries his house on his back. He is both the house and the person of that house.          But actually, under the shell is a little room where the true turtle, wearing long underwear, sits at a little table. At one end of the room a series of levers sticks out of slots in the floor, like the controls of a steam shovel. It is with these that the turtle controls the legs of his house.          Most of the time the turtle sits under the sloping ceiling of his turtle room reading catalogues at the little table where a candle burns. He leans on one elbow, and then the other. He crosses one leg, and then the other. Finally he yawns and buries his head in his arms and sleeps.          If he feels a child picking up his house he quickly douses the candle and runs to the control levers and activates the legs of his house and tries to escape.          If he cannot escape he retracts the legs and withdraws the so-called head and waits. He knows that children are careless, and that there will come a time when he will be free to move his house to some secluded place, where he will relight his candle, take out his catalogues and read until at last he yawns. Then he'll bury his head in his arms and sleep....That is, until another child picks up his house....
        




The Fight in the Meadow
 

          
          The curtains part: it is a summer's day. There a cow on a grassy slope watches as a bull charges an old aeroplane in a meadow. The bull is punching holes with its horns in the aeroplane's fabric...          Suddenly the aeroplane's engine ignites; the meadow is dark blue smoke...          The aeroplane shifts round and faces the charging bull.          As the bull comes in the propeller takes off the end of its muzzle. The bloody nostrils, a ring through them, are flung to the grass with a shattered blossom of teeth.          The bull, blood oozing from the stump of its face, backs off, and charges again. This time the propeller catches the bull behind its lower jaw and flings the head into a tree.          The headless bull backs off once more, and then charges down again. The propeller beating at the headless bull, cutting the body away in a great halo of blood, until only the back legs are standing. These run widely away through the meadow in figure eights and zigzags, until at last they find the aeroplane again. And as they come running down the propeller whacks them apart.          The legs, one with the tail still attached to it, the other somehow retaining both rectum and testicles, scamper off in opposite directions.          The aeroplane turns away; the engine stops.          The shadows are suddenly seen in lengthened form.          The watching cow begins to low ...
        




The Unforgiven
 

          
          After a series of indiscretions a man stumbled homeward, thinking, now that I am going down from my misbehavior I am to be forgiven, because how I acted was not the true self, which I am now returning to. And I am not to be blamed for the past, because I'm to be seen as one redeemed in the present...          But when he got to the threshold of his house his house said, go away, I am not at home.          Not at home? A house is always at home; where else can it be? said the man.          I am not at home to you, said his house.           And so the man stumbled away into another series of indiscretions...
        




With Sincerest Regrets
 

for Charles Simic
          Like a monstrous snail, a toilet slides into a living room on a track of wet, demanding to be loved.          It is impossible, and we tender our sincerest regrets. In the book of the heart there is no mention made of plumbing.          And though we have spent our intimacy many times with you, you belong to an unfortunate reference, which we would rather not embrace ...          The toilet slides away ...
        




martha promise receives leadbelly, 1935
 

when your man comes home from prison, 
when he comes back like the wound 
and you are the stitch, 
when he comes back with pennies in his pocket 
and prayer fresh on his lips, 
you got to wash him down first. 

you got to have the wildweed and treebark boiled 
and calmed, waiting for his skin like a shining baptism 
back into what he was before gun barrels and bars 
chewed their claim in his hide and spit him 
stumbling backwards into screaming sunlight. 

you got to scrub loose the jailtime fingersmears 
from ashy skin, lather down the cuffmarks 
from ankle and wrist, rinse solitary's stench loose 
from his hair, scrape curse and confession 
from the welted and the smooth, 
the hard and the soft, 
the furrowed and the lax. 

you got to hold tight that shadrach's face 
between your palms, take crease and lid 
and lip and brow and rinse slow with river water, 
and when he opens his eyes 
you tell him calm and sure 
how a woman birthed him 
back whole again.

Nights on Planet Earth
 

Heaven was originally precisely that: the starry sky, dating back to the earliest Egyptian texts, which include magic spells that enable the soul to be sewn in the body of the great mother, Nut, literally "night," like the seed of a plant, which is also a jewel and a star. The Greek Elysian fields derive from the same celestial topography: the Egyptian "Field of Rushes," the eastern stars at dawn where the soul goes to be purified. That there is another, mirror world, a world of light, and that this world is simply the sky--and a step further, the breath of the sky, the weather, the very air--is a formative belief of great antiquity that has continued to the present day with the godhead becoming brightness itself: dios/theos (Greek); deus/divine/diana (Latin); devas (Sanskrit); daha (Arabic); day (English).                --Susan Brind Morrow, Wolves and Honey

Gravel paths on hillsides amid moon-drawn vineyards,
click of pearls upon a polished nightstand 
soft as rainwater, self-minded stars, oboe music 
distant as the grinding of icebergs against the hull
of the self and the soul in the darkness 
chanting to the ecstatic chance of existence.
Deep is the water and long is the moonlight 
inscribing addresses in quicksilver ink,
building the staircase a lover forever pauses upon.
Deep is the darkness and long is the night,
solid the water and liquid the light. How strange 
that they arrive at all, nights on planet earth.

Sometimes, not often but repeatedly, the past invades my dreams in the form of a familiar neighborhood I can no longer locate, 
a warren of streets lined with dark cafs and unforgettable bars, a place where I can sing by heart every song on every jukebox,
a city that feels the way the skin of an octopus looks pulse-changing from color to color, laminar and fluid and electric,
a city of shadow-draped churches, of busses on dim avenues, or riverlights, or canyonlands, but always a city, and wonderful, and lost.
Sometimes it resembles Amsterdam, students from the ballet school like fanciful gazelles shooting pool in pink tights and soft, shapeless sweaters,
or Madrid at 4AM, arguing the 18th Brumaire with angry Marxists, or Manhattan when the snowfall crowns every trash-can king of its Bowery stoop,
or Chicago, or Dublin, or some ideal city of the imagination, as in a movie you can neither remember entirely nor completely forget, 
barracuda-faced men drinking sake like yakuza in a Harukami novel, women sipping champagne or arrack, the rattle of beaded curtains in the back,
the necklaces of Christmas lights reflected in raindrops on windows, the taste of peanuts and their shells crushed to powder underfoot, 
always real, always elusive, always a city, and wonderful, and lost. All night I wander alone, searching in vain for the irretrievable.

In the night I will drink from a cup of ashes and yellow paint.
In the night I will gossip with the clouds and grow strong.
In the night I will cross rooftops to watch the sea tremble in a dream.
In the night I will assemble my army of golden carpenter ants.
In the night I will walk the towpath among satellites and cosmic dust.
In the night I will cry to the roots of potted plants in empty offices.
In the night I will gather the feathers of pigeons in a honey jar.
In the night I will become an infant before your flag.





Containment
 

So long I have been carrying myself 
Carefully, carefully, like a small child 
With too much water in a real glass 
Clasped in two hands, across a space as vast 
As living rooms, while gazes watch the waves 
That start to rile the little inland sea 
And slap against its cliffs' transparency, 
Revise and meet, double their amplitude, 
Harmonizing doubt from many ifs. 
Distant frowns like clouds begin to brood. 
Soon there is overbrimming. Soon the child 
Looks up to find a face to match the scolding, 
And just as he does, the vessel he was holding 
Is almost set down safely on the bookshelf.





The Catch
 

Something has come between us-- 
It will not sleep. 
Every night it rises like a fish 
Out of the deep. 

It cries with a human voice, 
It aches to be fed. 
Every night we heave it weeping 
Into our bed, 

With its heavy head lolled back, 
Its limbs hanging down, 
Like a mer-creature fetched up 
From the weeds of the drowned. 

Damp in the tidal dark, it whimpers, 
Tossing the cover,   
Separating husband from wife, 
Lover from lover. 

It settles in the interstice, 
It spreads out its arms, 
While its cool underwater face 
Sharpens and warms: 

This is the third thing that makes 
Father and mother, 
The fierce love of our fashioning 
That will have no brother.





New Folk
 

I said Folk was dressed in Blues but hairier and hemped. 
After "We acoustic banjo disciples!" Jebediah said, "When 
and whereforth shall the bucolic blacks with good tempers 
come to see us pluck as Elizabeth Cotton intended?" 
We stole my Uncle Windchime's minivan, penned a simple   
ballad about the drag of lovelessness and drove the end 
of the chitlin' circuit to a joint skinny as a walk-in temple 
where our new folk was not that new, but strengthened 
by our twelve bar conviction. A month later, in pulled 
a parade of well meaning alabaster post adolescents. 
We noticed the sand-tanned and braless ones piled 
in the ladder-backed front row with their boyfriends 
first because beneath our twangor slept what I'll call 
a hunger for the outlawable. One night J asked me when 
sisters like Chapman would arrive. I shook my chin wool 
then, and placed my hand over the guitar string's wind- 
ow til it stilled. "When the moon's black," I said. "Be faithful."





Ode to Big Trend
 

Pretty soon the Negroes were looking to get paid. 
My partner, Big Trend, wiped his ox neck and said 

He wasn't going to wait too much longer. You 
Know that look your daddy gets before he whups you? 

That's how Big Trend looked. There was a pink scar 
Meddling his forehead. Most people assumed a bear 

Like him couldn't read anything but a dollar, 
But I'd watched him tour the used bookstore 
In town and seen him napping so I knew he held more 

Than power in those hands. They could tear 
A Bible in two. Sometimes on the walk home I'd hear 

Him reciting poems. But come Friday, he was the one 
The fellas asked to speak to the boss. He'd go alone, 

Usually, and left behind, we imagined the boss buckled 
Into Trend's shadow because our money always followed.





Stick Elegy
 

The dead were still singing Turn the lights down low 
Beneath Yellow Bridge where years before, clowning 
And ass out, Stick jumped with nothing but the State 
Championship trophy in his righteous clutch. The water 
Was supposed to be deepest there, and for three seasons 
Straight MVPs: Charlie "Fly" Kennison, Long Timmy Long, 
And Rocket Jefferson, those are the names I knew, jumped 

Free. But Stick's ankle broke. I fished him out, crumpled   
And bawling like the day he was born, like an object of 
Baptism, and a life of bad luck followed in the shape of 
Floods and fractured lightning, and then, numb, tooth- 
Less, and changed, the dead refused burial, striking out, 2 
By 2, 4 by 4, from the morgue house to raise trouble at 
The bridge. I started hearing birds everywhere after that.





Cocktails with Orpheus
 

After dark, the bar full of women part of me loves--the part that stood 
naked outside the window of Miss Geneva, recent divorce who owned 
a gun, O Miss Geneva where are you now--Orpheus says she did 

not perish, she was not turned to ash in the brutal light, she found 
a good job, she made good money, she had her own insurance and 
a house, she was a decent wife. I know descent lives in the word 

decent. The bar noise makes a kind of silence. When Orpheus hands 
me his sunglasses, I see how fire changes everything. In the mind 
I am behind a woman whose skirt is hiked above her hips, as bound 

as touch permits, saying don't forget me when I become the liquid 
out of which names are born, salt-milk, milk-sweet and animal-made. 

I want to be a human above the body, uprooted and right, a fold 
of pleas released, but I am a black wound, what's left of the deed.





Mystic Bounce
 

Even if you love the racket of ascension, 
you must know how the power leaves you. 
And at this pitch who has time for meditation? 
the sea walled in by buildings. I do miss 
the quiet, don't you? When I said, "Fuck the deer 
antlered and hithered in fur," it was because 
I had seen the faces of presidents balled into a fist. 
If I were in charge, I would know how to fix 
the world: free health care or free physicals, 
at least, and an abiding love for the abstract. 
When I said, "All of history is saved for us," 
it was because I scorned the emancipated sky. 
Does the anthem choke you up? When I asked 
God if anyone born to slaves would die 
a slave, He said: "Sure as a rock descending 
a hillside." That's why I'm not a Christian.





The French Prisoner
 

If only I could forget him, the Frenchman 
I saw outside our quarters, creeping round   
near daybreak in that density of garden 
as if he'd almost grown into the ground. 
He was just looking back, peering about him 
to check that he was safe here and alone: 
once he was sure, his plunder was all his! 
Whatever chanced, he'd not be moving on. 

He was already eating. He was wolfing 
a pilfered turnip hidden in his rags. 
Eating raw cattle feed. But he'd no sooner 
swallowed a mouthful than it made him gag; 
and the sweet food encountered on his tongue 
delight and then disgust, as it might be 
the unhappy and the happy, meeting in 
their bodies' all-consuming ecstasy. 

Only forget that body. . . Shoulder blades 
trembling, and a hand all skin and bone, 
the palm cramming his mouth in such a way 
that it too seemed to feed in clinging on. 
And then the furious and desperate shame 
of organs galled with one another, forced 
to tear from one another what should bind them 
together in community at last. 

The way his clumsy feet had been left out 
of all that gibbering bestial joy; and how 
they stood splayed out and paralyzed beneath 
the body's torture and fierce rapture now. 
And his look too--if I could forget that! 
Retching, he went on gobbling as if driven 
on and on, just to eat, no matter what, 
anything, this or that, himself even. 
Why go on? It turned out that he'd escaped 
from the prison camp nearby--guards came for him. 
I wander, as I did then in that garden, 
among my garden shadows here at home. 
"If only I could forget him, the Frenchman"-- 
I'm looking through my notes, I read one out, 
and from my ears, my eyes, my mouth, the seething 
memory boils over in his shout: 

"I'm hungry!" And immediately I feel 
the undying hunger which this wretched creature 
has long since ceased to feel, for which there is 
no mitigating nourishment in nature. 
He feeds on me. More and more hungrily! 
And I'm less and less sufficient, for my part. 
Now he, who would have been contented once 
with any kind of food, demands my heart.





On the Wall of a KZ Lager
 

Where you've fallen, you will stay. 
In the whole universe this one 
and only place is the sole place 
which you have made your very own. 

The country runs away from you. 
House, mill, poplar--every thing   
is struggling with you here, as if 
in nothingness mutating. 

But now it's you who won't give up. 
Did we fleece you? You've grown rich. 
Did we blind you? You watch us still. 
You bear witness without speech.





Van Gogh's Prayer
 

A battle lost in the cornfields 
and in the sky a victory. 
Birds, the sun and birds again. 
By night, what will be left of me? 

By night, only a row of lamps, 
a wall of yellow clay that shines, 
and down the garden, through the trees, 
like candles in a row, the panes; 

there I dwelt once and dwell no longer-- 
I can't live where I once lived, though 
the roof there used to cover me. 
Lord, you covered me long ago.





Cy Twombly, "Night Watch"
 

As gestures to beckon geometry's end 
I post letters to my lost Mayan sisters,   
solicit layers sussed from layers to test 
history, push past parallel. Mystery 
becomes you, Mother, as does the lust the rest 
of us suffer, lust you must once have induced. 
What perceptions I trust defy perspective. 
I take my troubles scribbled, not erased.





Cy Twombly, "Beyond (A System for Passing)"
 

To say how much I've missed you, I offer this,   
at most mist, at least assorted letters, lists, 
numbers I insist tell stories. I kissed you 
last, Dad, in the casket in which you passed on, 
to some next place, but last listened for your voice 
last night, these long years after, will listen next 
when next oppressed by blue-gray, as I am now, 
as I, thus lost, am always by your absence.





Lemnos
 

the deep male growl of the sea-lashed headland --Sophocles, Philoctetes
August long ago, the summer Lemnian 
(not like the deeds of those who killed their men), 
the self a glowing bead, like Hephaestus falling 
daylong out of heaven in the old story, 
the island's interior a forge, a glory hole, 
the odor of wild thyme borne offshore steadily, 
the Aegean Sea purple, wine-dark, without epithet; 
and as I walked on the beach, my mother not long dead, 
the perfect crystal of my self-regard 
so lately flawed, and landscape made to echo 
my own low cry in the island's empty places, 
I found a pure white bone that wind and salt 
had scoured of every grief and all self-pity: 
and so I came to the love of others.





The Red Portrait
 

Last night she came to me, my mother, dead: 
but as she was in the photo, that last Christmas, 
wearing a red dress, and her lipstick was red 
(I wonder if that means she lives in hell), 
and I saw again that she was beautiful, 
the same high forehead I have, the same wide brow, 
and just my age, forty-nine; and now I was 
talking fast, because I knew I had no time, 
and I told her I loved her, I told her how her life 
had informed mine, and I begged her to come 
to me again, to meet my children, my wife. 
I said to her--My work, see what I have made, 
I have tried to do what you did not live to do. 
But she smiled at me and began to fade.





Conversion Comedy
 

"I thought of you as a butterfly tonight," getting to eschatology from a sketchpad, your mom's. 
And though you write sermons nice and linear you also digress and about-face. 
The jeroboam trees are dark tonight. 
Darker in the outage than the stars let the sky be. 
Partyers all. 
The abbot told you, "I do not have power, the archbishop does not have power, the pope does not have power. Only God has power." 
Then it is not a kind of violence to put a photo of the Pope in a luscious hacienda, imperilled by a minature pullbell. 
Someone admired the hostess's oils. "Yes, it was a surprise when they hired me to teach but they said, 'We can teach an artist to teach but we can't teach a teacher to be an artist.'" "How true," the guests murmured. 
This was not your mother though artists all say it "comes from somewhere else." 
When another guest compared the Catholic to the Episcopal service she said, "I think not." 
In a desert once I almost fell off a cliff. 
To calm me down a friend told a joke: "Descartes was sitting on a plane. The stewardess said, 'Coffee or tea?' 'I think not,' Descartes said, and vanished." 
It took a moment to sink in because I thought he said "The cart" as in "beverage cart." 
Confusion is the only way to get to eschatology from a sketchpad. 
I'm trying to redeem that abbot. 
Drawing in the outage. 

Once you suggest the origins of music lay in the necessity of drowning out the cries of sacrificial victims, I start listening for them--the cries--under my own singing. 
Scholars resurrect books all the time just by quoting them. 
When Roman gods popped out of the soil, the Christians looked around wildly. 
Sculpt the mouth around "sculpture," ulpt. 
They reburied them hurriedly, and the earth gulped. 
The statue of the Commendatore went down with Don Giovanni. Which shall I believe, the unrepentence of the sinkholed Don? 
Or the statue that converts Leontes by resurrecting his all-forgiving wife? 
Hermione who's peerless has a likeness; he who won't about-face is not "mocked by art" but brought posthaste to hell, his "shapely seat and heart". . . 
The moon slips out like a foreign coin from denim: a drachma, an as. 
Can we redeem it? 
Cities are places are conversion, you said. But I am citiless. 
"She ascended to the thrown," you wrote by mistake, of Elizabeth.





Johnny One Note
 

Bobby Hutcherson in Oakland
The mallet strikes but something's off, 
and so he hits again, curling that lower lip, 
purses his brow, as if this sign, this minor woe, 
were speech the vibes might understand, 
so when he lifts bluish lids as if wakened 
to the desired tone that rings now, it seems, 
it sounds, under wraps, a water-ly quaver, 
through the club crowd's silence, 
as it floats above us like an aerosol 
trying to find a new way to escape, 
passes through the wall's mortared pores 
to reverb in the cool night air of an 
unpeopled sidewalk, droning toward tracks 
where a passing peopled train sucks up 
and winds his finally found, wowed tone 
around its wheels, held there by steel heat 
one hundred miles, until it reaches the sea, 
where wheels and whistle overreach 
surging surf the good vibration feels such 
desire for, and leaves its tedium 
of the round and round, lofting to a sea 
that comes and goes but finally simply goes, 
as one night, this night, the cool vibes' air 
(struck finally in the changed groove of sax 
and ecstatic kit) is free, finally free, 
to go where we won't hear from it again.





"Pacific Surfliner" Now Arriving San Diego
 

The Santa Fe Depot's Moorish architecture of displacement-- 
squeaky kids trawl satchels through the shed, happy voices 
mystically far from home, the waiting room's fizzled, tiled light 
of life lived imperfectly between one where and another. 
Everybody's here. Cowboys, Mennonites, Tijuana illegals, 
Muslim cabbies at prayer on loading docks as dark clouds 
fuss above the southerly sun past its prime. 

Killing time, a life mostly miscues and hesitance, 
I want something to take me over so looked for you 
near the baggage claim's glide, who could have been   
anybody from everywhere, like Ellis Island's ghosts, 
their dump of cardboard valises, bindles, baby-fat sacks 
strangled by hemp, and around me here long-haul lovers who 
in sleepers last night loved to exhaustion. Scorched roughnecks, 
perfumed girls in heels grabbing Samsonites and golf bags 
schooling the carousel's louvered U-turns and straightaways. 

It must be why I'm here, to wait and see who claims 
what looks too much like your brown suede duffel, 
no "Antigua" or "Cancun" decaled in its hide, 
nasal music threading the scene while tonight you weave 
through songs somewhere else. That floppy bag and us-- 
the Garment District, two Venices, South End, South Philly, 
scraped nap, brass clips, gaunt warmed handle. . . 
A teenage girl two-hands it off the belt and waddles 
into the runny sun, your bag five years late 
thumping freshened thighs and dimpled knees. 
Where are you now that you're here again for me? 
Hear these thrilled voices, 
                                       the engine horn howling? 
                                                                                 Smell these acid residues?





Myrrha to the Source
 

O fluent one, o muscle full of hydrogen, 
o stuff of grief, whom the Greeks 
accuse of spoiling souls, 

whose destiny is downward, 
whose reflecting's up--I think 
I must have come from you. 

Just one more cup.





From the Towers
 

Insanity is not a want of reason. 
It is reason's overgrowth, a calculating kudzu. 

Explaining why, in two-ton manifesti, thinkers sally forth 
with testaments and pipe bombs. Heaven help us: 

spare us all your meaningful designs. Shine down or 
shower forth, but (for the earthling's sake) ignore 
all prayers followed by against, or for. Teach us to bear 

life's senselessness, our insignificance, and more; 
let's call that sanity. The terrifying prospect isn't some 
escapist with a novel, fond of comfort, munching sweets-- 

it is the busy hermeneut, so serious he's sour, intent on making 
meaning of us all, and bursting from the towers to the streets.





Space Bar
 

Lined up behind the space bartender 
is the meaning of it all, the vessels 
marked with letters, numbers, 
signs. Beyond the flats 

the monitor looms, for all the world 
like the world. Images and 
motions, weeping women, 
men in hats. I have killed 

many happy hours here, 
with my bare hands, 
where TV passes for IV, among 
the space cadets and dingbats.





The semantics of flowers on Memorial Day
 

Historians will tell you my uncle 
wouldn't have called it World War II 
or the Great War plus One or Tombstone 

over My Head. All of this language 
came later. He and his buddies 
knew it as get my ass outta here 

or fucking trench foot and of course 
sex please now. Petunias are an apology 
for ignorance, my confidence 

that saying high-density bombing 
or chunks of brain in cold coffee 
even suggests the athleticism 

of his flinch or how casually 
he picked the pieces out. 
Geraniums symbolize the secrets 

life kept from him, the wonder 
of variable-speed drill and how 
the sky would have changed had he lived 

to shout it's a girl. My hands 
enter dirt easily, a premonition. 
I sit back on my uncle's stomach 

exactly like I never did, he was 
a picture to me, was my father 
looking across a field at wheat 

laying down to wind. For a while, 
Tyrants' War and War of World Freedom 
and Anti-Nazi War skirmished 

for linguistic domination. If 
my uncle called it anything 
but too many holes in too many bodies 

no flower can say. I plant marigolds 
because they came cheap and who knows 
what the earth's in the mood to eat.





Dropping the euphemism
 

He has five children, I'm papa 
to a hundred pencils. 
I bought the chair he sat in 

from a book of chairs, 
staplers and spikes 
that let me play Vlad the Impaler 

with invading memos. When I said 
I have to lay you off 
a parallel universe was born 

in his face, one where flesh 
is a loose shirt 
taken to the river and beaten 

against rocks. Just 
by opening my mouth I destroyed 
his faith he's a man 

who can think honey-glazed ham 
and act out the thought 
with plastic or bills. We sat. 

I stared at my hands, he stared 
at the wall staring at my hands. 
I said other things 

about the excellent work he'd done 
and the cycles of business 
which are like 

the roller-coaster thoughts 
of an oscilloscope. All this time 
I saw the eyes of his wife 

which had always been brown 
like almonds but were now brown 
like the crust of bread. We walked 

to the door, I shook his hand, 
felt the bones pretending 
to be strong. On his way home 

there was a happy song 
because de Sade invented radio, 
the window was open, he saw 

delphinium but couldn't remember 
the name. I can only guess. 
Maybe at each exit 

that could have led his body 
to Tempe, to Mars, he was tempted 
to forget his basketball team 

of sons, or that he ever liked 
helping his wife clean carrots, 
the silver sink turning orange. 

Running's natural to most animals 
who aren't part 
of a lecture series on Nature's 

Dead Ends. When I told him, 
I saw he was looking for a place 
in his brain to hide 

his brain. I tried that later 
with beer, it worked until I stood 
at the toilet to make my little 

waterfall, and thought of him 
pushing back from a bar 
to go make the same noise.





Spirit ditty of no fax-line dial tone
 

The telephone company calls and asks what the fuss is. 
Betty from the telephone company, who's not concerned 
with the particulars of my life. For instance 
if I believe in the transubstantiation of Christ 
or am gladdened at 7:02 in the morning to repeat 
an eighth time why a man wearing a hula skirt of tools 
slung low on his hips must a fifth time track mud 
across my white kitchen tile to look down at a phone jack. 
Up to a work order. Down at a phone jack. Up to a work order. 
Over at me. Down at a phone jack. Up to a work order 
before announcing the problem I have is not the problem 
I have because the problem I have cannot occur 
in this universe though possibly in an alternate 
universe which is not the responsibility or in any way 
the product, child, or subsidiary of AT&T. With practice 
I've come to respect this moment. One man in jeans, 
t-shirt and socks looking across space at a man 
with probes and pliers of various inclinations, nothing 
being said for five or ten seconds, perhaps I'm still 
in pajamas and he has a cleft pallet or is so tall 
that gigantism comes to mind but I can't remember 
what causes flesh to pile that high, five or ten seconds 
of taking in and being taken in by eyes and a brain, 
during which I don't build a shot gun from what's at hand, 
oatmeal and National Geographics, or a taser from hair 
caught in the drain and the million volts of frustration 
popping through my body. Even though. Even though his face 
is an abstract painting called Void. Even though 
I'm wondering if my pajama flap is open, placing me 
at a postural disadvantage. Breathe I say inside my head, 
which is where I store thoughts for the winter. All 
is an illusion I say by disassembling my fists, letting each 
finger loose to graze. Thank you I say to kill the silence 
with my mouth, meaning fuck you, meaning die 
you shoulder-shrugging fusion of chipped chromosomes 
and pus, meaning enough. That a portal exists in my wall 
that even its makers can't govern seems an accurate mirror 
of life. Here's the truce I offer: I'll pay whatever's asked 
to be left alone. To receive a fax from me stand beside 
your mailbox for a week. It will come in what appears 
to be an envelope. While waiting for the fax reintroduce 
yourself to the sky. It's often blue and will transmit 
without fail everything clouds are trying to say to you.





Quaker Meeting, The Sixties
 

Seeing my friend's son in his broad-brimmed hat 
and suspenders, I think of the Quakers 
who lectured us on nonviolent social action 
every week when I was a child. In the classrooms 
we listened to those who would not take up arms, 
who objected, who had accepted alternative 
service in distant work camps and showed 
slides of hospitals they helped to build. 
On Wednesdays, in Meeting for Worship, 
when someone rose to speak, 
all the energy in the room 
flew inside her mouth, empowering her to tell 
what she had seen on her brief 
encounter with the divine: sometimes, a parable, 
a riddle, a kindness. The fall that we were seventeen, 
we scuffed our loafers on the gravelly path 
from the Meetinghouse, while maple and elm 
leaves sailed around our shoulders   
like tiny envelopes, our futures sealed inside. 
Despite the war in Vietnam, I felt safer 
than I ever would again. Perhaps 
those aged, protective trees had cast a spell 
on us, or maybe the nonviolent Quaker God 
had set up a kingdom right there-- 
suburban Philadelphia. Looking back, I see how 
good deeds and thoughts climbed with us to the attic 
room for Latin, descended to the gym for sports, 
where we hung from the praiseworthy scaffolds 
of righteous behavior. We prepared to leave 
for college, armed with the language of the American 
Friends and the memories of Thanksgiving 
dinners we'd cooked for the unfortunates: 
borrowing our parents' cars to drive 
downtown to the drop-off point, racing back 
to play our last field hockey match. Grim center forwards 
shook hands before the whistle, the half-backs' 
knee-pads strapped on tight; one varsity team vanquished another.





Opals
 

--for Tamar Craig
I knew the hard winter of sapphires 
set within gold claws, 
amber and pipestone strung on gut, 
fringed pouches stuffed with hash. 
Separate, separate, I urged her 
that summer of Woodstock, 
when I lied to get the car 
and draped my love beads 
around the neck of someone else's sister. 

In a hayloft in Ohio 
my friend lifted three bales 
to show me a litter of week-old kittens, 
each pair of eyes infected with a slimy mucus. 
Their pupils swam in opaque opal membranes 
and they would have gone blind 
if she had not pulled an eyedropper 
of antibiotics from her jacket, 

doing what the mother cat 
could not do, what the owners 
would not trouble themselves to do, 
doing what a sister or friend 
might do if she took the time 
to attend the wayward, opalescent 
unhappiness in this world.





Yom Kippur, Taos, New Mexico
 

I've expanded like the swollen door in summer 
            to fit my own dimension. Your loneliness 

is a letter I read and put away, a daily reminder 
            in the cry of the magpie that I am 

still capable of inflicting pain 
            at this distance. 

Like a painting, our talk is dense with description, 
            half-truths, landscapes, phrases layered 

with a patina over time. When she came into my life 
            I didn't hesitate. 

Or is that only how it seems now, looking back? 
            Or is that only how you accuse me, looking back? 

Long ago, this desert was an inland sea. In the mountains 
            you can still find shells. 

It's these strange divagations I've come to love: midday sun 
            on pink escarpments; dusk on gray sandstone; 

toe-and-finger holes along the three hundred and fifty-seven foot 
            climb to Acoma Pueblo, where the spirit 

of the dead hovers about its earthly home 
            four days, before the prayer sticks drive it away. 

Today all good Jews collect their crimes like old clothes 
            to be washed and given to the poor. 

I remember how my father held his father around the shoulders 
            as they walked to the old synagogue in Philadelphia.





Benzene
 

It is the right time for hallucinations. 
Drowning in a sty, the sailor 
feels the ocean's buoyancy. 
Dying in a web, the moth 
discards its wings and falls free. 

I wish something would put its hands on me, 
give me stronger poison and then stronger. 
The beautiful flotillas do not stop. 
Undying love drifts and delays. 
I am capsizing. 

Great joy lingers still. 
Nothing can be said for suffering. 
It is legible only to strangers 
and at great distances. It detests 
survivors. It drapes gun-carriages 

with flowers, lampposts with hanging boys. 
It is the right time for hallucinations, 
most nakedly of inmost west. 
Her death would be less tender now, 
dusted over with charity, 

a web of useless wings, a shallow sty. 
She gave me stronger poison and then stronger. 
I miss her. 
In the back seat of the taxi, 
dark breathlessness says "Hurry, hurry.





Warm Days in January
 

It has never been so easy to cry 
openly or to acknowledge children. 
Never before could I walk directly 
to the center of an island city 
feeling the automatism of millions 
drawing one pious breath, shouldering 
the sunset, holding it up in the oily 
tree-line a while longer. Years ago, 
I was never sad enough and nothing 
but a hotel that I could tear to pieces 
and reconstruct inside a shoebox 
felt like home. My parents died. Their miserable 
possessions washed up in other hotels, 
dioramas of the febrile romantic. 

I take my first lover, already 
gray at her temples and more reticent 
than shy, more tacit than admiring, 
to the bus stop by the Jewish Museum. 
We wait in the dark a long time. 
She does not kiss me. She hurries 
up out of the oily street onto the humming, 
fluorescent podium of the last bus 
where I see her a last time, not waving 
to me, not lovable, erect in the freedom 
we traduced years ago in our first kiss. 

Never deny the power of withdrawal. 
Never doubt that thought and time make things small. 
Never refuse the easy exit line or prescribed 
uncomprehending gesture. At childhood's end, 
none can tell happiness from buoyancy. 
None of it made any difference-- 
the patricides, the hotels ill-constructed, 
the inconstant starlight of drugs and rebellion. 
We are no more complicated 
than our great-grandparents who dreaded 
the hotel life. Like them, we seek the refuge 
of warm days in January, a piety 
whose compulsion is to survive according 
to explicit laws no young woman adores 
or young man follows with darling hunger.





Last
 

The unsigned architecture of loneliness 
is becoming taller, finding a way farther 
above the horizontal flowering 
of the Cold War, the peonies 
and star asters of wild partisanship. 
I have a shambling gait and lonely 
hysteria, but no Terror. I am free 
to shamble past the vacant lot of my son's 
conception, to shamble past the bar where I 
conceived adultery as a Terror 
that would be endless, flowering 
in great waves through air striated like chenille. 
I walk for a long time and try to conjure 
elsewhere in its early isolation. 
I cannot. It is all redestinated 
by the future like the loose balloons 
a janitor recovers at 6 am 
from cold light fixtures. The Cold War is ending. 
Buildings are taller and have no names. 

1. 
The romance of every ideology 
torments the romance of another. How 
beautifully, in the beginning, in 
the gale and embrace of isolation, boys 
capered over a shambles and swore oaths. 
The scent of urine in the hall at home 
was righteousness. The beautiful nude 
obscured by dust in a paperweight 
was righteousness. Neglectful townships coming 
into steep flower just as boys were flowering 
needed the correction of righteousness,   
the horizontal slag of government 
by children. Only the insane allegiances 
endure. The mad counterparts are lovers 
passion cannot explain nor circumstances 
restrict to the dead zones of irony. 
A counterpart of end of the Cold War 
is adultery. A counterpart 
of loving a divided Berlin 
unto death is fatherhood, the doting 
maintenance of sons in vacant lots 
continuing the wars of rubble 
for righteousness' sake and for the sake 
of nudes obscured by dust and vulgarity. 

Romance torments romance. The most beautiful 
moment of the twentieth century 
galed and embraced the acrid smoky air 
as the Red Army entered Berlin 
as Hitler shriveled in the gasoline fire 
as Red Army flags opened above Berlin 
safeguarding the ruins of a changeless future. 
Townships blackened even as they flowered. 
Loose balloons cluttered the low sky and sun. 
I walked for a long time and tried to conjure 
the form of kindness. It was a domestic 
animal confused in the tall grass. 
Boys set fire to the grass. History 
that opens flags opened the fire, 
and Berlin, divided from Berlin, 
began to love its children past all reason. 

2. 
My son reads sermons of pain and writes on walls. 
He starves the ground 
he walks on, preparing a dead city 
to be worthy of its new flags, to shine 
as exploded windows shine, raining down 
for hours after the wrecking crews have gone. 
I have a lover now who hates children. 
The hatred floats inside of her, a weightless 
sexual pavilion of perfect form 
and perfect emptiness. I thought 
by making love to her I would conceive 
nothing but Terror, outrage upon outrage, 
a violence that would last my whole life 
and free my son. I was ignorant as a balloon. 

Across the luminous expressway, I see 
the shapes of charred tenements castellated, 
fading into the more tender shapes of night. 
It may be the last night in history. Tomorrow 
pulls down the Berlin Wall, pulls down my honor, 
and I return to my lover's bed to float 
in a white condom, no longer my son's father. 
Tomorrow describes everything in detail. 
It explains nothing. It does not teach my boy 
that tenements are better than the future, 
better that peace, more likely to produce 
brothers than are the glassy hands of mornings 
without end or walls denuded of their wire. 
In the dead zone of irony before dawn, 
only the cats cry, like martyrs in the flame. 

3. 
Gates everywhere. The Brandenburg. The Great 
Gate of Kiev beneath which children stride 
onto an invisible crescendo 
disappearing into gasoline fires, 
emerging as the new shapes of righteousness 
in slow vans through the Brandenburg Gate. 
Oaths are secret because none suspects 
that they are kept. They thrust themselves towards us 
unashamedly, like the insane homeless, 
and we do not see them. In our loneliness, 
we see a chance for love in betrayal, 
not death. In our loneliness, we see the happy 
triumph of glassy hands in free elections, 
not the denuding of Berlin or wanderings 
of children in vans reduced by fire 
to black transparencies in the morning shade. 
When Joan of Arc surrendered to the flames 
she cried out "Jesus, Jesus. Some years later, 
a failed magician who had lover her cried out 
"Joan, Joan as the flames mocked him with a sortilege 
too easy to be unreal or profitable. 

I walk for a long time and try to conjure 
the form of loneliness without Cold War. 
It is ash upon ash, a chiaroscuro 
aloft and on the ground, completely still. 
Oaths are secret because none suspects 
the desperation of every object, the child 
in every atom of the misused world 
thrust towards us, crying out whatever 
sacred name it witnessed put to death 
on the ascending music of a wall. 
Our buildings are tall and have no names. 
The parks grow glassy hands instead of flowers. 

4. 
Afterwards, the calm is piteous 
but insubstantial as a smell of burn 
that does not rise in smoke or dies with the fire. 
Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise 
and having to invent air, invent light 
from nothing but untriggered memory. 
All things beloved are recalled to pain. 
Air recollected from the wrists of girls 
braceleted for Confirmation, crossed. 
Light recollected from between the cars 
of night trains in a deep river valley 
where islands in the river glowed like swans. 
Air recollected form a ditch in flower. 
Light recollected from the sex of flowers 
in bare rooms, the grainy light of blondes. 
Air recollected from religion. 
Light recollected form the incensed clutch 
of bodies before sunrise in the oaths 
of a great and ignorant lost cause. 

Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise 
having spent the night in bed with a stranger. 
Aloft and on the ground the calm 
unfurls like flags without device or slogan. 
The inconsequence of the day ahead 
stirs airless atmospheres in darkness 
visible as daylight but without shade. 
Without Cold War, without the arbitrary 
demarcation of cause from cause, of light 
and air from the unsexed improvisations 
of memory, I cannot see to walk 
or breathe to breathe. Sex becomes applause. 
Sex becomes television, and the bastard 
avant garde of lonely architecture 
breaks ground at the unwired heart of a city 
that marks the capital of nothing now. 

5. 
A scratchy, recorded call to prayer crosses 
the alley from one new building into mine. 
The consolations of history are furtive, 
then fugitive, then forgotten like a bar 
of music that might have been obscene or sacred 
once, in another city, in the days 
before today. My son is well. He works 
the public ground and needs no Antigone. 
My lover sits beside him at dinner, 
sharing a joke, unmapping the tall future 
and its unbiased children, reinventing 
the sexual pavilion to accommodate 
plague wards. Romance forgives romance. 

The early isolation of this gorgeous 
century disappears into good works. 
The future is best. To put a final stop 
to the grotesque unmercy of martyrdom 
and to the ruinous armies of mad boys 
whose government is rape, whose justice 
is a wall, revoke all partisanship, 
adjourn the Terror. The future is best. 
It unobscures the dusty nudes. It protects 
the river islands and their glowing swans. 
But when I need to die, who will light the fire? 
What names shall I cry out and what music 
burn to a black transparency in my heart? 
The unborn have been revoked. They will not be kind.





Radio Crackling, Radio Gone
 

Thousands of planes were flying and then 
they stopped. We spend days moving our eyes 

across makeshift desks, we sit on a makeshift floor; 
we prepare for almost nothing that might happen. 

Early on, distant relations kept calling. 
Now, nothing: sound of water 

tippling a seawall. Nothing: sparks 
lighting the brush, sparks polishing the hail, 

the flotsam of cars left standing perfectly still. 
Thud of night bird against night air, 

there you are on the porch, swath 
of feathers visible through the glass, 

there you are on the stairs where the cat fell 
like a stone because her heart stopped. 

What have you found in the wind above town square? 
Is it true that even the statues have gone? 

Is there really a hush over everything as there used to be 
in morning when one by one we took off our veils?





fire
 

more the idea of the flame than the flame, 
as in: the flame 

of the rose petal, the flame of the thorn 
the sun is a flame, the dog's teeth 

flames 

~ 

to be clear: with the body, 

captain, we can do as we wish, we can do 
as we wish with the body 

but we cannot leave marks--capt'n I'm 
trying to get this right 

~ 

the world's so small, the sky's so high 
we pray for rain it rains, we pray for sun it suns 

we pray on our knees, we move our lips 
we pray in our minds, we clasp our hands 

our hands look tied before us 

~ 

I remember, capt'n, something, it didn't happen, not 
to me--this guy, I knew him by 

face, I don't remember his 
name, one night 
he's walking home from a party, a car it 

clipped him, for hours he 
wandered, dazed, his family, his 
neighbors, with flashlights they 

searched, all night, the woods, calling out 
his name 

~ 

here's the part, capt'n, where I try to tell a story 
as if it were a confession: once, 

in elementary school, I was hiding out 
on damon rock, lighting 
matches & letting them drop to the leaves 

below--little flare- 

ups, flash fires--a girl wandered 
down the path, she just 

stood there, watching the matches fall from my hand-- 

~ 

capt'n, I'm trying to be precise: hot 

day, a cage in the sun, a room without 
air, the mind-bending heat, the music 

a flame--hey 
metallica hey britanny hey airless hey fuse, I 

don't know how it happened, I was perched far 
above, I offered her a match 

to pull down her pants--one match, her 
hairless body, hey 

little girl, I dropped it unlit.   

I didn't know what it was I was looking at. 

~ 

hey capt'n I don't know if I'm allowed 
hey capt'n years ago I'm walking 

down a road one drunk night, even now I 
wonder--sometimes still I 

imagine--was I hit by a bus, am I stumbling am I   

dazed, this 

dream this confession, hey 
little girl is yr daddy home, hey capt'n hey 

sir am I making any sense? 

~ 

the boy stood on the burning deck, stammering 
elocution, wait-- 
the boy stood in the burning cage, stammering 
electrocution, no--the boy stood in the hot-hot room 
stammering I did stammering I did stammering I 
did stammering I did stammering everything you say I did 
I did. 

~ 

hey metallica hey britanny hey airless hey fuse 
hey phonograph hey hades hey thoughtless hey 

~ 

capt'n this room is on fire 
capt'n, this body will not stop burning 
capt'n oh my captain this burning has become a body
capt'n oh my captain this child is ash 
capt'n oh my captain my hands pass right through her 
capt'n oh my captain I don't know what it is I'm looking at 

~ 

it's important to be precise, to say what 
I know-- 

the sun is fire, the center of the earth 
is fire, yr mother's cunt is 

fire, an airless flame, still, still, I don't know why 
she pushed me out, this cold-cold furnace, we all 

were pushed, a rim of light around our heads, she 
gave a kick, sent us crawling 

out, toward the flame, toward the pit, the flaming 
pit, yr lover's 
cunt, the flame her tongue, the flame 

a thorn 

~ 

everyday, capt'n, sir, captain, I was 
left, a child, after school, I was alone, I found 

a match, under the sink I found a can, a spray 
can, ly-sol dis-infectant, it made a 

torch, I was careful the flame didn't 
enter the can, I knew it 

would explode, somehow I knew, I'm 
trying to be clear sir--the flame 

shot across the room, then it was gone





The Dogs at Live Oak Beach, Santa Cruz
 

As if there could be a world 
Of absolute innocence 
In which we forget ourselves 

The owners throw sticks 
And half-bald tennis balls 
Toward the surf 
And the happy dogs leap after them 
As if catapulted-- 

Black dogs, tan dogs, 
Tubes of glorious muscle-- 

Pursuing pleasure 
More than obedience 
They race, skid to a halt in the wet sand, 
Sometimes they'll plunge straight into 
The foaming breakers 

Like diving birds, letting the green turbulence 
Toss them, until they snap and sink 

Teeth into floating wood 
Then bound back to their owners 
Shining wet, with passionate speed 
For nothing, 
For absolutely nothing but joy.





A Letter of Recommendation
 

On summer nights I sleep naked
in Jerusalem. My bed
stands on the brink of a deep valley
without rolling down into it.

In the daytime I walk around with the Ten
Commandments on my lips
like an old tune someone hums to himself.

Oh touch me, touch me, good woman!
That's not a scar you feel under my shirt, that's 
a letter of recommendation, folded up tight,
from my father:
"All the same, he's a good boy, and full of love.

I remember my father waking me for early prayers.
He would do it by gently stroking my forehead, not
by tearing away the blanket.

Since then I love him even more.
And as his reward, may he be wakened
gently and with love
on the Day of the Resurrection.





After The Pillow Book
 

You call me to the bath, where 
by evening light before bed I rub 
the ointment into your maculate back. 
I place my hand between the wings 
of your scapulae, where you cannot 
reach, cannot see--the arc of your life 
revealed in its pattern of coffee-colored 
spots--and hover there awhile, 
remembering how we watched the lover 
read the manuscript painted on the skin 
of his beloved; how he pressed 
the words to his chest and face--and cried out. 
The arteries in my palm open, their warmth 
rising between us as I massage you, neither 
sexual nor umbilical, 
this connection--you trusting 
your back to me, and 
me with no deceit. 
Only salve, only unguent. 
Only balm.





Scissors
 

Sharpen your wit--
Each half of it--
Before you shut
Scissors to cut

Shear skin deep
Underneath wool
Expose the sheep
Whose leg you pull





At Night the States
 

At night the states 
I forget them or I wish I was there 
          in that one under the 
Stars. It smells like June in this night 
          so sweet like air. 
I may have decided that the 
          States are not that tired 
Or I have thought so. I have 
          thought that. 

At night the states 
And the world not that tired 
          of everyone 
Maybe. Honey, I think that to 
          say is in 
light. Or whoever. We will 
          never 
replace you. We will never re- 
          place You. But 
in like a dream the floor is no   
          longer discursive 
To me it doesn't please me by 
          being the vistas out my 
window, do you know what 
          Of course (not) I mean? 
I have no dreams of wake- 
          fulness. In 
wakefulness. And so to begin. 
          (my love.) 

At night the states 
talk. My initial continuing contr- 
          diction 
my love for you & that for me 
deep down in the Purple Plant the oldest 
          dust 
of it is sweetest but states no longer 
          how I 
would feel. Shirt 
that shirt has been in your arms 
          And I have 
that shirt is how I feel 

At night the states 
will you continue in this as- 
          sociation of 
matters, my Dearest? down 
          the street from 
where the public plaque reminds 
          that of private 
loving the consequential chain 
          trail is 
matters 

At night the states 
that it doesn't matter that I don't 
          say them, remember 
them at the end of this claustro- 
          phobic the 
dance, I wish I could see I wish 
          I could 
dance her. At this night the states 
          say them 
out there. That I am, am them 
          indefinitely so and 
so wishful passive historic fated 
          and matter- 
simple, matter-simple, an 
          eyeful. I wish 
but I don't and little melody. 
          Sorry that these 
little things don't happen any 
          more. The states 
have drained their magicks 
          for I have not 
seen them. Best not to tell. But 
          you 
you would always remain, I   
          trust, as I will 
always be alone. 

At night the states 
whistle. Anyone can live. I 
can. I am not doing any- 
          thing doing this. I 
discover I love as I figure. Wed- 
          nesday 
I wanted to say something in 
          particular. I have been 
where. I have seen it. The God 
          can. The people 
do some more. 

At night the states 
I let go of, have let, don't 
          let 
Some, and some, in Florida, doing. 
          What takes you so 
long? I am still with you in that 
          part of the 
park, and vice will continue, but 
          I'll have 
a cleaning Maine. Who loses 
          these names 
loses. I can't bring it up yet, 
          keeping my 
opinions to herself. Everybody in 
          any room is a 
smuggler. I walked fiery and   
          talked in the 
stars of the automatic weapons 
          and partly for you 
Which you. You know. 
At night the states 
have told it already. Have 
          told it. I 
know it. But more that they 
          don't know, I 
know it too. 

At night the states 
whom I do stand before in 
          judgment, I 
think that they will find 
          me fair, not 
that they care in fact nor do 
          I, right now 
though indeed I am they and 
          we say 
that not that I've 
          erred nor 
lost my way though perhaps 
          they did (did 
they) and now he is dead 
          but you 
you are not. Yet I am this 
          one, lost 
again? lost & found by one- 
          self 
Who are you to dare sing to me? 

At night the states 
accompany me while I sit here 
          or drums 
there are always drums what for 
          so I 
won't lose my way the name of 
          a 
personality, say, not California 
          I am not 
sad for you though I could be 
          I remember 
climbing up a hill under tall 
          trees 
getting home. I was 
going to say that the air was 
          fair (I was 
always saying something like 
          that) but 
that's not it now, and that 
          that's not it 
isn't it either 

At night the states 
dare sing to me they who seem 
          tawdry 
any more I've not thought I 
          loved them, only 
you it's you whom I love 
the states are not good to me as 
          I am to them 
though perhaps I am not 
when I think of your being 
          so beautiful 

but is that your beauty 
          or could it be 
theirs I'm having such a 
          hard time remembering 
any of their names 
your being beautiful belongs 
          to nothing 
I don't believe they should 
          praise you 
but I seem to believe they 
          should 
somehow let you go 

At night the states 
and when you go down to 
          Washington 
witness how perfectly anything 
          in particular 
sheets of thoughts what a waste 
          of sheets at 
night. I remember something 
          about an 
up-to-date theory of time. I 
          have my 
own white rose for I have 
          done 
something well but I'm not 
          clear 
what it is. Weathered, perhaps 
          but that's 
never done. What's done is 
          perfection. 

At night the states 
ride the train to Baltimore 
we will try to acknowledge what was 
but that's not the real mirror 
          is it? nor 
is it empty, or only my eyes 
          are 
Ride the car home from Washington 
          no 
they are not. Ride the subway 
          home from 
Pennsylvania Station. The states 
          are blind eyes 
stony smooth shut in moon- 
          light. My 
French is the shape of this 
          book 
that means I. 

At night the states 
the 14 pieces. I couldn't just 
walk on by. Why 
aren't they beautiful enough 
in a way that does not 
          beg to wring 
something from a dry (wet) 
          something 
Call my name 

At night the states 
making life, not explaining anything 
but all the popular songs say call 
          my name 
oh call my name, and if I call 
          it out myself to 
you, call mine out instead as our 
          poets do 
will you still walk on by? I 
          have 
loved you for so long. You 
          died 
and on the wind they sang 
          your name to me 
but you said nothing. Yet you 
          said once before 
and there it is, there, but it is 
          so still. 
Oh being alone I call out my 
          name 
and once you did and do still in 
          a way 
you do call out your name 
to these states whose way is to walk 
on by that's why I write too much 

At night the states 
whoever you love that's who you 
          love 
the difference between chaos and 
          star I believe and 
in that difference they believed 
          in some 
funny way but that wasn't 
          what I 
I believed that out of this 
          fatigue would be 
born a light, what is fatigue 
there is a man whose face 
          changes continually 
but I will never, something 
          I will 
never with regard to it or 
          never regard 
I will regard yours tomorrow 
I will wear purple will I 
and call my name 

At night the states 
you who are alive, you who are dead 
when I love you alone all night and 
          that is what I do 
until I could never write from your 
          being enough 
I don't want that trick of making 
          it be coaxed from 
the words not tonight I want it 
          coaxed from 
myself but being not that. But I'd 
          feel more 
comfortable about it being words 
          if it 
were if that's what it were for these 
          are the 
States where what words are true 
          are words 
Not myself. Montana, Illinois.

Dog Biscuits
 

After my father's cremation, 
my sisters and I agreed 
to bury him privately 
when the ground thawed. 
One will plant a flowering tree, 
one see to the stone and its cutting, 
one call the grave digger and the town clerk. 
It'll be just us, the daughters, 
presiding over ashes that could be 
any mammal's, or those of any love 
dispersible by wind. 

Let's bury the secret violence to his dogs, 
Pompey and Tara, Juba and Molly, 
their ashes already gone to this ground. 
And his "escapades, as Mom called them. 
Here withers that branch of the tree. 

Let's bury the ring inscribed 
In perpetuum ave atque vale (translated 
"Hail and farewell by my father, 
"Hello, and good-bye forever by Mom, 
a token dating back to the First Separation) 
and a tennis ball for canine shades. 
Your dad is with his dogs now, 
said more than one person at the funeral. 

It'll be just us, the three inheritors, 
on a raw windy day in Death's kingdom, 
lifting our eyes from the hole 
to the mountains hazed with spring, 
saying, In perpetuum ave atque vale, 
minor god of our father. 
Let's each of us drop a few 
dog biscuits into his grave.





Wac-A-Mole Realism
 

          
          At the carnival, Robo-Boy sees only things he recognizes. The Ferris Wheel is an overgrown version of his own bells and whistle eyes. His Flashers, his mother calls them. The Tilt-A-Whirl is the angle his head tilts when the Flirt Program goes into effect, usually in the vicinity of a Cindy or a Carrie, though once he found himself tilting at the school librarian which caused him to wheel in reverse into the Civil War section knocking over a cart of books that were waiting to be shelved under B. There's a dangerously low stratosphere of pink cotton-candy clouds being carried around by the children. If Robo-Boy goes near them, the alarms will go off. It's the kind of sticky that would cause joint-lock for sure. In a darker, safer corner Robo-Boy finds the Whack-A-Mole game. He pays a dollar and starts whacking the plastic moles on their heads each time they pop up from the much-dented log. He wins bear after bear. It's only when he's lugging them home, the largest one skidding face-down along the sidewalk getting dirt on its white nose and light blue belly, that he remembers the program: Wac-A-Mole Realism--the disc on the installer's desk. Suddenly it all fits together: the way a deliciously strange thought will start wafting out of his unconscious--and then WHAM, it disappears.
        




Relay Octets
 

* 

If sound, then why not the full reach of mind, 
and if that cantilever then why not the whole 
keyboard with its totality of partials? 
But then one meets the dragon, pipes up a bright 
disciple, whose two dramas, lieber Meister, 
are suicide and the founding of the state. 
My name is a household word, writes the hid teacher 
to his ambitious aspirant, in my own household. 

       * 

Three, three, and two, the comeliest proportions 
in twice four, carols a bobolink at midtree, 
the golden sections of sight flap nostalgic for sound. 
But of touch there is no ratio, there are only   
gradient, ascent, compression, easing, 
and space evacuated, not yearning; filled. 
Therefore, Belovd, middle is neither midmost 
nor at the squeezed core, but where breath resumes. 

       * 

A man who had killed in order to save life, 
and had left his clan to guide the foreigner, 
never went home. Or, home was what he came to. 
The girl who knew that something before and after, 
of which no one spoke, was always brimming now, 
came to his corner, knitted, did not speak. 
What had striven in him and was seeding in her 
gazed out over the harbor, through white sails crossing.

The Price is Right: A Torture Wheel of Fortune
 

A B H O R E N C E S  November 13, 1984
The show did not start off 
auspiciously, the contestants 
were nervous and kept fiddling 
with the wires attached 
to their privates, the men 
being especially anxious 
over the question of balls. 
The women were more querulous. 

The first question, a medical subject, 
was why had the anti-abortionists 
not mentioned, let alone commented on, 
the Baboon Heart transplant? 
One terrified contestant guessed 
it was because the moral majority's 
nervous concern with evolution 
precluded their bringing it up. 
That hopeful contestant's face 
reflected the malicious light 
in the eyes of the host who 
immediately threw the switch 

A powerful surge shot through 
the wires and both sexes screamed 
and writhed, to the delight of 
the vast viewership, estimated 
at 100 million, all of whom, 
presumably, were delighted 
not to be on the show, 
because not one in a million 
knew the answer.





Ode on the Facelifting of the "statue" of Liberty
 

A B H O R R E N C E S  4 July, 1986
America is inconceivable without drugs 
and always has been. One of the first acts 
was to dump the tea. The drug that furnished 
the mansions of Virginia was tobacco, 
a drug now in much disrepute. 
Sassafras, a cure-all, is what they came for 
and they dealt it by the bale altho it 
was only a diaphoretic to make you perspire-- 
people were so simple in those days. 
The Civil War saw the isolation of morphine 
making amputation a pleasure and making 
the block of wood between the teeth, 
which was no drug, obsolete. Morphinism 
was soon widespread among doctors and patients. 
At this date interns, the reports tell us, 
are among the premier drug ab/users 
of said moralistic nation. "Rock stars 
(who notoriously "have doctors) 
consume drugs by the metric ton 
even as they urge teenagers to Say No. 
The undercurrent of American history 
has been the running aches and pains 
of the worn path to the door of the apothecary 
to fetch cannabis and cocaine elixirs 
by the gallon. It has been all prone 
all seeking Florida, Ponce de Len 
was just the beginning of a statistical curve 
whose only satisfaction would be total vertigo. 
His eager search for youth has become our 
frantic tilt with death and boredom, 
in fact we are farming death in Florida 
with far greater profit than we are 
farming food in Iowa--elixirs are as multiform 
as the life-style frauds we implore, 
a cultural patchwork fit for a fool 
in the only country in the world 
with a shop called the Drug Store.





Sweet Tooth
 

          
          A little girl made of sugar and spice and everything nice was eaten by someone with a sweet tooth the size of an elephant's tusk.          Ah, he said, this darn tooth, it's driving me nuts.           Then another voice is heard. It's the little girl's father who says, have you seen a little girl made of sugar and spice and everything nice?--Incidentally, what's that thing sticking out of your mouth like an elephant's tusk?          My sweet tooth, and it's really driving me nuts.          You ought to see a dentist.          But he might want to pull it, and I don't like people pulling at me. If they want to pull they should pull at their own pullables.          So true, said the little girl's father, people should pull at their own pullables and let other people's pullables alone. But still, he asked again, I wonder if you've seen a little girl made of sugar and spice and everything nice?
        




The Academic Sigh
 

          
          Some students were stretching a professor on a medieval torture rack. He had offered himself to show them how an academic might be stretched beyond his wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum.          And as they turned the wheel the professor was getting longer and longer.          Don't make me too long, or I'll look kind of goofy, sighed the professor as he grew longer and longer.           Suddenly something snaps.          What happened? sighs the professor from the rack.          We were just stretching an academic when suddenly something snapped; you may have heard it ...          Yes, I was there. Don't you remember? sighs the professor.          And then we heard an academic sigh ...          Yes, I heard it, too, sighs the professor, it seemed to come from the rack where I was being stretched beyond my wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum ...
        




Angels
 

          
          They have little use. They are best as objects of torment.          No government cares what you do with them.           Like birds, and yet so human . . .          They mate by briefly looking at the other.          Their eggs are like white jellybeans.           Sometimes they have been said to inspire a man to do more with his life than he might have.          But what is there for a man to do with his life?           . . . They burn beautifully with a blue flame.           When they cry out it is like the screech of a tiny hinge; the cry of a bat. No one hears it . . .
        




Yellowjackets
 

When the plowblade struck   
An old stump hiding under   
The soil like a beggar's   
Rotten tooth, they swarmed up   
& Mister Jackson left the plow   
Wedged like a whaler's harpoon.   
The horse was midnight   
Against dusk, tethered to somebody's   
Pocketwatch.  He shivered, but not   
The way women shook their heads   
Before mirrors at the five   
& dime--a deeper connection   
To the low field's evening star.   
He stood there, in tracechains,   
Lathered in froth, just   
Stopped by a great, goofy   
Calmness.  He whinnied   
Once, & then the whole   
Beautiful, blue-black sky   
Fell on his back.





The Cleaving
 

He gossips like my grandmother, this man 
with my face, and I could stand 
amused all afternoon 
in the Hon Kee Grocery, 
amid hanging meats he 
chops: roast pork cut 
from a hog hung 
by nose and shoulders, 
her entire skin burnt 
crisp, flesh I know 
to be sweet, 
her shining 
face grinning 
up at ducks 
dangling single file, 
each pierced by black 
hooks through breast, bill, 
and steaming from a hole 
stitched shut at the ass. 
I step to the counter, recite, 
and he, without even slightly 
varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue, 
scribbles my order on a greasy receipt, 
and chops it up quick. 

Such a sorrowful Chinese face, 
nomad, Gobi, Northern 
in its boniness 
clear from the high 
warlike forehead 
to the sheer edge of the jaw. 
He could be my brother, but finer, 
and, except for his left forearm, which is engorged, 
sinewy from his daily grip and 
wield of a two-pound tool, 
he's delicate, narrow- 
waisted, his frame 
so slight a lover, some 
rough other 
might break it down 
its smooth, oily length. 
In his light-handed calligraphy 
on receipts and in his 
moodiness, he is 
a Southerner from a river-province; 
suited for scholarship, his face poised 
above an open book, he'd mumble 
his favorite passages. 
He could be my grandfather; 
come to America to get a Western education 
in 1917, but too homesick to study, 
he sits in the park all day, reading poems 
and writing letters to his mother. 

He lops the head off, chops 
the neck of the duck 
into six, slits 
the body 
open, groin 
to breast, and drains 
the scalding juices, 
then quarters the carcass 
with two fast hacks of the cleaver, 
old blade that has worn 
into the surface of the round 
foot-thick chop-block 
a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel. 

The head, flung from the body, opens 
down the middle where the butcher 
cleanly halved it between 
the eyes, and I 
see, foetal-crouched 
inside the skull, the homunculus, 
gray brain grainy 
to eat. 
Did this animal, after all, at the moment 
its neck broke, 
image the way his executioner 
shrinks from his own death? 
Is this how 
I, too, recoil from my day? 
See how this shape 
hordes itself, see how 
little it is. 
See its grease on the blade. 
Is this how I'll be found 
when judgement is passed, when names 
are called, when crimes are tallied? 
This is also how I looked before I tore my mother open. 
Is this how I presided over my century, is this how 
I regarded the murders? 
This is also how I prayed. 
Was it me in the Other 
I prayed to when I prayed? 
This too was how I slept, clutching my wife. 
Was it me in the other I loved 
when I loved another? 
The butcher sees me eye this delicacy. 
With a finger, he picks it 
out of the skull-cradle 
and offers it to me. 
I take it gingerly between my fingers 
and suck it down. 
I eat my man. 

The noise the body makes 
when the body meets 
the soul over the soul's ocean and penumbra 
is the old sound of up-and-down, in-and-out, 
a lump of muscle chug-chugging blood 
into the ear; a lover's 
heart-shaped tongue; 
flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes; 
the butcher working 
at his block and blade to marry their shapes 
by violence and time; 
an engine crossing, 
re-crossing salt water, hauling 
immigrants and the junk 
of the poor. These 
are the faces I love, the bodies 
and scents of bodies 
for which I long 
in various ways, at various times, 
thirteen gathered around the redwood, 
happy, talkative, voracious 
at day's end, 
eager to eat 
four kinds of meat 
prepared four different ways, 
numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables, 
each made by distinct affections 
and brought to table by many hands. 

Brothers and sisters by blood and design, 
who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes, 
we constitute a many-membered 
body of love. 
In a world of shapes 
of my desires, each one here 
is a shape of one of my desires, and each 
is known to me and dear by virtue 
of each one's unique corruption 
of those texts, the face, the body: 
that jut jaw 
to gnash tendon; 
that wide nose to meet the blows 
a face like that invites; 
those long eyes closing on the seen; 
those thick lips 
to suck the meat of animals 
or recite 300 poems of the T'ang; 
these teeth to bite my monosyllables; 
these cheekbones to make 
those syllables sing the soul. 
Puffed or sunken 
according to the life, 
dark or light according 
to the birth, straight 
or humped, whole, manqu, quasi, each pleases, verging 
on utter grotesquery. 
All are beautiful by variety. 
The soul too 
is a debasement 
of a text, but, thus, it 
acquires salience, although a 
human salience, but 
inimitable, and, hence, memorable. 
God is the text. 
The soul is a corruption 
and a mnemonic. 

A bright moment, 
I hold up an old head 
from the sea and admire the haughty 
down-curved mouth 
that seems to disdain 
all the eyes are blind to, 
including me, the eater. 
Whole unto itself, complete 
without me, yet its 
shape complements the shape of my mind. 
I take it as text and evidence 
of the world's love for me, 
and I feel urged to utterance, 
urged to read the body of the world, urged 
to say it 
in human terms, 
my reading a kind of eating, my eating 
a kind of reading, 
my saying a diminishment, my noise 
a love-in-answer. 
What is it in me would 
devour the world to utter it? 
What is it in me will not let 
the world be, would eat 
not just this fish, 
but the one who killed it, 
the butcher who cleaned it. 
I would eat the way he 
squats, the way he 
reaches into the plastic tubs 
and pulls out a fish, clubs it, takes it 
to the sink, guts it, drops it on the weighing pan. 
I would eat that thrash 
and plunge of the watery body 
in the water, that liquid violence 
between the man's hands, 
I would eat 
the gutless twitching on the scales, 
three pounds of dumb 
nerve and pulse, I would eat it all 
to utter it. 
The deaths at the sinks, those bodies prepared 
for eating, I would eat, 
and the standing deaths 
at the counters, in the aisles, 
the walking deaths in the streets, 
the death-far-from-home, the death- 
in-a-strange-land, these Chinatown 
deaths, these American deaths. 
I would devour this race to sing it, 
this race that according to Emerson 
managed to preserve to a hair 
for three or four thousand years 
the ugliest features in the world. 
I would eat these features, eat 
the last three or four thousand years, every hair. 
And I would eat Emerson, his transparent soul, his 
soporific transcendence. 
I would eat this head, 
glazed in pepper-speckled sauce, 
the cooked eyes opaque in their sockets. 
I bring it to my mouth and-- 
the way I was taught, the way I've watched 
others before me do-- 
with a stiff tongue lick out 
the cheek-meat and the meat 
over the armored jaw, my eating, 
its sensual, salient nowness, 
punctuating the void 
from which such hunger springs and to which it proceeds. 

And what 
is this 
I excavate 
with my mouth? 
What is this 
plated, ribbed, hinged 
architecture, this carp head, 
but one more 
articulation of a single nothing 
severally manifested? 
What is my eating, 
rapt as it is, 
but another 
shape of going, 
my immaculate expiration? 

O, nothing is so 
steadfast it won't go 
the way the body goes. 
The body goes. 
The body's grave, 
so serious 
in its dying, 
arduous as martyrs 
in that task and as 
glorious. It goes 
empty always 
and announces its going 
by spasms and groans, farts and sweats. 

What I thought were the arms 
aching cleave, were the knees trembling leave. 
What I thought were the muscles 
insisting resist, persist, exist, 
were the pores 
hissing mist and waste. 
What I thought was the body humming reside, reside, 
was the body sighing revise, revise. 
O, the murderous deletions, the keening 
down to nothing, the cleaving. 
All of the body's revisions end 
in death. 
All of the body's revisions end. 

Bodies eating bodies, heads eating heads, 
we are nothing eating nothing, 
and though we feast, 
are filled, overfilled, 
we go famished. 
We gang the doors of death. 
That is, out deaths are fed 
that we may continue our daily dying, 
our bodies going 
down, while the plates-soon-empty 
are passed around, that true 
direction of our true prayers, 
while the butcher spells 
his message, manifold, 
in the mortal air. 
He coaxes, cleaves, brings change 
before our very eyes, and at every 
moment of our being. 
As we eat we're eaten. 
Else what is this 
violence, this salt, this 
passion, this heaven? 

I thought the soul an airy thing. 
I did not know the soul 
is cleaved so that the soul might be restored. 
Live wood hewn, 
its sap springs from a sticky wound. 
No seed, no egg has he 
whose business calls for an axe. 
In the trade of my soul's shaping, 
he traffics in hews and hacks. 

No easy thing, violence. 
One of its names? Change. Change 
resides in the embrace 
of the effaced and the effacer, 
in the covenant of the opened and the opener; 
the axe accomplishes it on the soul's axis. 
What then may I do 
but cleave to what cleaves me. 
I kiss the blade and eat my meat. 
I thank the wielder and receive, 
while terror spirits 
my change, sorrow also. 
The terror the butcher 
scripts in the unhealed 
air, the sorrow of his Shang 
dynasty face, 
African face with slit eyes. He is 
my sister, this 
beautiful Bedouin, this Shulamite, 
keeper of sabbaths, diviner 
of holy texts, this dark 
dancer, this Jew, this Asian, this one 
with the Cambodian face, Vietnamese face, this Chinese 
I daily face, 
this immigrant, 
this man with my own face.





The Eagle That Is Forgotten
 

(John P. Altgeld, Governor of Illinois and my next-door neighbor, 1893-1897. Born December 30, 1847; died March 12, 1902.)
Sleep softly . . . eagle forgotten . . . under the stone.
Time has its way with you there, and the clay has its own.

We have buried him now, thought your foes, and in secret rejoiced.
They made a brave show of their mourning, their hatred unvoiced. 
They had snarled at you, barked at you, foamed at you day after day, 
Now you were ended. They praised you . . . and laid you away. 

The others that mourned you in silence and terror and truth,
The widow bereft of her crust, and the boy without youth,
The mocked and the scorned and the wounded, the lame and the poor, 
That should have remembered forever . . . remember no more. 

Where are those lovers of yours, on what name do they call, 
The lost, that in armies wept over your funeral pall?
They call on the names of a hundred high-valiant ones,
A hundred white eagles have risen the sons of your sons,
The zeal in their wings is a zeal that your dreaming began
The valor that wore out your soul in the service of man.

Sleep softly . . . eagle forgotten . . . under the stone, 
Time has its way with you there and the clay has its own. 
Sleep on, O brave-hearted, O wise man that kindled the flame--
To live in mankind is far more than to live in a name,
To live in mankind, far, far more . . . than to live in a name.






Why I Voted the Socialist Ticket
 

I am unjust, but I can strive for justice.
My life's unkind, but I can vote for kindness.
I, the unloving, say life should be lovely.
I, that am blind, cry out against my blindness.

Man is a curious brute--he pets his fancies--
Fighting mankind, to win sweet luxury.
So he will be, though law be clear as crystal,
Tho' all men plan to live in harmony.

Come, let us vote against our human nature,
Crying to God in all the polling places
To heal our everlasting sinfulness
And make us sages with transfigured faces.






The Windy City [sections 1 and 6]
 

1 

The lean hands of wagon men 
put out pointing fingers here, 
picked this crossway, put it on a map,   
set up their sawbucks, fixed their shotguns, 
found a hitching place for the pony express, 
made a hitching place for the iron horse, 
the one-eyed horse with the fire-spit head, 
found a homelike spot and said, "Make a home,   
saw this corner with a mesh of rails, shuttling 
       people, shunting cars, shaping the junk of 
       the earth to a new city. 

The hands of men took hold and tugged 
And the breaths of men went into the junk 
And the junk stood up into skyscrapers and asked: 
Who am I? Am I a city? And if I am what is my name? 
And once while the time whistles blew and blew again 
The men answered: Long ago we gave you a name, 
Long ago we laughed and said: You? Your name is Chicago. 

Early the red men gave a name to the river,   
       the place of the skunk,   
       the river of the wild onion smell,   
       Shee-caw-go.   

Out of the payday songs of steam shovels,   
Out of the wages of structural iron rivets,   
The living lighted skyscrapers tell it now as a name,   
Tell it across miles of sea blue water, gray blue land: 
I am Chicago, I am a name given out by the breaths of working men,   
       laughing men, a child, a belonging.   

So between the Great Lakes,   
The Grand De Tour, and the Grand Prairie,   
The living lighted skyscrapers stand, 
Spotting the blue dusk with checkers of yellow, 
       streamers of smoke and silver,   
       parallelograms of night-gray watchmen,   
Singing a soft moaning song: I am a child, a belonging.   


 6 

The wheelbarrows grin, the shovels and the mortar 
       hoist an exploit.   
The stone shanks of the Monadnock, the Transportation,   
       the People's Gas Building, stand up and scrape 
       at the sky.   
The wheelbarrows sing, the bevels and the blueprints 
       whisper.   
The library building named after Crerar, naked 
       as a stock farm silo, light as a single eagle 
       feather, stripped like an airplane propeller, 
       takes a path up.   
Two cool new rivets says, "Maybe it is morning. 
       "God knows. 

Put the city up; tear the city down; 
       put it up again; let us find a city. 
Let us remember the little violet-eyed 
       man who gave all, praying, "Dig and 
       dream, dream and hammer, till your 
       city comes. 

Every day the people sleep and the city dies; 
       every day the people shake loose, awake and 
       build the city again. 

The city is a tool chest opened every day, 
       a time clock punched every morning, 
       a shop door, bunkers and overalls 
       counting every day. 

The city is a balloon and a bubble plaything 
       shot to the sky every evening, whistled in 
       a ragtime jig down the sunset. 

The city is made, forgotten, and made again, 
       trucks hauling it away haul it back 
       steered by drivers whistling ragtime 
       against the sunsets. 

Every day the people get up and carry the city, 
       carry the bunkers and balloons of the city, 
       lift it and put it down. 

               "I will die as many times 
               as you make me over again, 
               says the city to the people, 
I am the woman, the home, the family, 
I get breakfast and pay the rent; 
I telephone the doctor, the milkman, the undertaker; 
       I fix the streets 
       for your first and your last ride-- 
Come clean with me, come clean or dirty, 
I am stone and steel of your sleeping numbers; 
       I remember all you forget. 
       I will die as many times 
       as you make me over again. 

Under the foundations,   
Over the roofs,   
The bevels and the blueprints talk it over.   
The wind of the lake shore waits and wanders.   
The heave of the shore wind hunches the sand piles. 
The winkers of the morning stars count out cities 
And forget the numbers.   






Graceland
 

Tomb of a millionaire,

A multi-millionaire, ladies and gentlemen,

Place of the dead where they spend every year

The usury of twenty-five thousand dollars

For upkeep and flowers

To keep fresh the memory of the dead.

The merchant prince gone to dust

Commanded in his written will

Over the signed name of his last testament

Twenty-five thousand dollars be set aside

For roses, lilacs, hydrangeas, tulips,

For perfume and color, sweetness of remembrance

Around his last long home.


(A hundred cash girls want nickels to go to the movies to-night.

In the back stalls of a hundred saloons, women are at tables

Drinking with men or waiting for men jingling loose silver dollars in their pockets.

In a hundred furnished rooms is a girl who sells silk or dress goods or leather stuff for 

six dollars a week wages

And when she pulls on her stockings in the morning she is reckless about God and the 

newspapers and the police, the talk of her home town or the name people call her.)







The Caveman on the Train
 

When first the apprizing eye and tongue that muttered 
(Banished from Eden's air? Or pride of apes?) 
Sat clinking flint on flint, as they shattered 
Snatched with a grin what fell in craftier shapes, 
The law was move or die. Lively from tigers; 
Dainty on deer. As weather called the tune. 
Oxen, we learned, would bear us. So would rivers. 
And that was science. On the whole a boon. 

What caveman on a round rock dumped a-grunting 
Rubbed at a rueful hip, brow darkening why? 
Or gaped at boulders over gravel shifting 
Until--a splendor of wheel-thought like sunrise! 
No wonder: such example in a heaven 
Revving immaculate gears, and at his feet 
The planet on her axle greased and even. 
Put any wheel to earth, and two wheels meet. 

Athens cut ruts of marble; ivory courses 
Caromed Apollo's car of talkative gold.   
And Donne saw wagon-ways. The horsepower: horse 
Over the flats of Kansas sail-cars rolled.   
First planks on querulous ground, then treads of met 
Steel set edgewise, over stone for ties.   
A mountain? Sawtooth rail or crank-and-cable 
Till iron took serene the incredulous rise.   

Compleat with a nifty moniker, Puffing Billy,   
Best Friend of Charleston, Wabash Cannonball, 
Cycloped (horse on treadmill trudging), dapper 
Black and gold of Byzantium, Sans Pareil 
Flew in the face of time and testy weather, 
Enemies both, the lurid brakemen know.   
(By stoves where sand is baking crisp, they gather 
Trading the tall tales of high-striding snow.)   

The lone prairie, the twilight grey as steel, 
The vanishing freight--oh see the lonely road 
Our fathers wandered, stumbling on the wheel 
--Daydreamers all, and the long row unhoed-- 
Sky-hankering men, their reverence still alive 
Some years ago: with burning glass and sun 
George Stephenson in 1825 
Snatched fire for Locomotion No. 1. 

Ten miles an hour, "immoderate twelve. Today 
Slow Down to Ninety, warns the black ravine. 

He will go far, the caveman, this-a-way. 

By grand indifference to the red and green. 






Hospital
 

It seems so--          
I don't know.  It seems   
as if the end of the world   
has never happened in here.   
No smoke, no   
dizzy flaring except   
those candles you can light   
in the chapel for a quarter.   
They last maybe an hour   
before burning out.   
                            And in this room   
where we wait, I see   
them pass, the surgical folk--     
nurses, doctors, the guy who hangs up   
the blood drop--ready for lunch,   
their scrubs still starched into wrinkles,   
a cheerful green or pale blue,   
and the end of a joke, something   
about a man who thought he could be--    
what?  I lose it   
in their brief laughter.





Reservation
 

This prairie holds us 
with its plainness. 
An ugly wife. 
We would not stay but children comfort us 
and we need this flatness. 

On our table 
a carp with a tumor 
on its lip, 
larva eating its side. 

An old man laughs, 
one silver tooth 
in his head 
like a galvanized 
watertank. 

We are driven back 
into the land, 
our raccoon faces 
banded around the eyes 
with motorcycle goggles. 
Every car we had 
rusting in the yard. 

We saddle the buffalo 
and say we are captives. 
This barrenness holds 
us down like a wife.





Indian Chant
 

Hunted and sung 
unhunted / unsung 

clump of 
loghouse / chaxed hill 

unuttered / unstrung 

clistered bow 
hunted and unsung 

hunted / strung 
hunted / sung.





The Eight O Five
 

The t(rain) 
again this morning, sky always gray, 
grain cars f(lying) 
like blackbirds with fieldseed 
in their bellies. 

The eight o five carrying 
g(rain) 
sings like tribes 
when they migrated north in summer 
across the plains 
following tracks of herds. 

High water into trees. 
The lake full of rain. 
We say it is someone else 
pushing down on the lake 
to make it spill over its edge. 

While we wait 
the woman earth sings with the tribes, 
transforms herself 
into all things. 

After the train 
b(rush) burning, the delay of smoke 
in the car comes after 
we have passed like sound. 

Rain hangs fringe from earth woman's dress. 
She holds the delay of truth 
until it comes from our mouths. 

Coyotes sleep on her lap, 
birds fly into the b(ranches) of her hair 
while farther down the road 
the black snake train wiggles behind her ear.





Reservation School for Girls
 

I. 
We hang clothes on the line. 
His wide trousers and shirt, wind-beat, 
roar small thunder from one prairie cloud. 

The same rapple of flag on its pole. 

Half in fear, half in jest, we laugh. 
He calls us crow women. 
Our black hair shines in the sun 
and in the light from school windows. 

He drives his car to town, upsets the dust 
on buckboard hills. 
We sit on the fence when he is gone. 
Does he know we speak of thunder in his shirts? 

We cannot do well in his school. 
He reads from west to east, 
The sun we follow moves the other way. 

Crowbar. 

Our eyes come loose from words on the page 
in narrow rooms of the reservation school. 
He perceives and deciphers at once. 

For us 
written letters will not stay on the page, 
but fall like crows from the sky and hit 
against the glass windows of the school. 

Our day is night when we sit in rows of the classroom. 
Leaves in a whirlwind from sumac groves. 
Flock of crows are black starts on a white night. 

II. 
On the porch of the reservation school 
the blackbirds walk around our feet, 
fly into our head. 
They call our secret name. 

Dark corridors linger in our mind 
We whisper the plains to one another. 

We do not talk of what we cannot understand. 
Black and white fleckered dresses. 

Our face like our fathers. 

The sun is no enemy to the eye looking west. 
The brush thin as hair of old ones. 

It blinds the eye, makes fire on fields, 
flashes against windows like silver ribbons 
on burial robes. 

Hot late into the fall, windy, ready for 
cold to sweep in. 
The heat seems solid, but totters on the brink 
of winter. 

We laugh to ourselves when he returns to the 
reservation school for girls. 
Take his clothes from the line. 
Set the table with salt and pepper, spoon, knives. 
Cattails and milk-pods in a jar. 

We get lard from the basement, 
rub a place in the dusty window like a moon in the ancient sky. 

III. 
One hill larger than the others: 
an old buffalo with heavy head and whiskers 
nods at the ground, 
grazes in my dreams, one blade at a time. 

We stay in our stiff white-sheeted beds in the 
dormitory room. 
Buffalo wander in our dreams. 

White night-dresses. 
Black pods suspended in sumac groves like crows. 

In the sweat lodge of sleep 
we make our vision quest, 
black as pitch in crevice between crow feathers. 

We hang his thunder clothes in sleep, 
arms reach above our beds like willows blowing slowly 
by the creek. 

Quietly we choke, 
hold our wounded arms like papooses. 

Clothes beat on lines. 
Sumac groves and whirl of leaves: 
a shadow of our fathers at council fires. 

Red leaves, waxy as hay on fields. 
We dream of schoolrooms. 

Written letters on the wind. 

He reads crow-marks on the page but does not know 
crow.





Weighing Light
 

Often the slightest gesture is most telling,
As when he reaches tenderly in passing 
To pluck the yellow leaf from the dark fall 

Of her hair, or even the absence of all gesture: 
The way she doesn't need to turn to know 
Who, in this gathering of friends, has touched her. 

It was as if he dreamed some private garden. 
Perhaps he woke from it, mid-reach, to find 
His hand too near her hair in this crowded yard, 

And maybe even now she's shuttering in 
(She's even better than you or I at that) 
A storm of worry and recrimination-- 

Did anyone notice? how could he do that here!-- 
By seamlessly continuing to tell you 
About her trip to see her favorite Vermeer 

This morning in the Delft show at the Met: 
"So now they say she isn't weighing pearls 
Or gold or anything--it's just the light 

Gleaming off empty scales. So much is hard 
To know for sure. If I confronted her, 
She'd say it was just a leaf--who could afford 

To disagree? Could we? Now she's explaining 
How the girl faces a mirror we can't see into 
And how behind her hangs a gloomy painting 

Of the Last Judgment: "Over her head God 
Floats in a cloud, she says, "like a thought balloon.   
But you don't hear. You're watching me. I nod.





James Schuyler
 

I went to his sixty-sixth birthday 
dinner: sixteen years ago this past 
November. I remember that it was at 
Chelsea Central (his favorite restaurant: 
great steaks) on 10th Avenue, and 
that Ashbery was there, and a few 
others, including Joe, impeccably 
dressed and gracious, who picked up 
what must have been (I thought 
at the time) an exorbitant bill. 

I remember him saying more than 
once, "Joe always picks up the bill, 
then smiling a slightly wicked smile. 

Sitting with him (those excruciating 
silences!) in his room at the Chelsea, 
my eyes would wander from his book- 
shelves (The Portrait of a Lady stood out) 
to the pan of water on the radiator 
to the records strewn on the floor 
to some scraggly plants (ivy? herbs?) 
in ceramic pots at the base of the French 
doors that opened to the balcony and 
balustrade and sound of traffic on 23rd 
Street six floors below. He read me 
"White Boat, Blue Boat shortly after he 
wrote it, and a poem about Brook Benton 
singing "Rainy Night in Georgia that 
didn't make it into his Last Poems, though 
I remember thinking it beautiful. He 
complained, in a letter to Tom, about 
how much I smoked, and how emotional 
I'd get during movies: he must have been 
referring to Field of Dreams (he had a yen 
for Kevin Costner). When he took me 
to see L'Atalante, a film he loved, I was 
bored. Once, we took the subway (he 
hadn't ridden it in years) to the Frick; 
I remember admiring Romney's Lady 
Hamilton. It hurt that he didn't invite 
me to the dinner after his Dia reading 
or to the reception after his reading at the 
92nd Street Y, though he did, at the latter, 
read "Mood Indigo, dedicated to me. 
When he said my name from the stage, 
Joan and Eileen, sitting to my left, turned 
and stared at me; frozen by the enormity 
of the moment, I couldn't look back. 
When he came to a reading I gave at 
St. Mark's, Raymond impressed upon 
me what an honor it was: Jimmy didn't 
go to many poetry readings. What else 
is there to say? That when I visited him 
at St. Vincent's the day before he died 
Darragh said, "He likes to hear gossip. 
So I said, "Eileen and I are talking again. 
That at his funeral I sat alone (Ira couldn't 
come); that that was the loneliest feeling 
in the world. That afterwards Doug said 
"You look so sad. How should I have 
looked, Doug! And that a year after he 
died, I dreamt I saw him in the lobby of 
the Chelsea Hotel. He was wearing a 
hospital shift and seemed to have no 
muscle control over his face--like in inten- 
sive care after his stroke. He saw me 
and said, "It's nice to see some familiar 
faces. I approached him, but he 
disappeared.





Helen, the Sad Queen
 

Azure, 'tis I, come from Elysian shores 
To hear the waves break on sonorous steps, 
And see again the sunrise full of ships 
Rising from darkness upon golden oars. 

My solitary arms call on the kings 
Whose salty beards amused my silver hands. 
I wept; they sang of triumphs in far lands, 
And gulfs fled backward upon watery wings. 

I hear the trumpet and the martial horn 
That wield the rhythm of the beating blade, 
The song of rowers binding the tumult. 

And the gods! exalting on the prow with scorn 
Their ancient smile that the slow waves insult, 
Hold out their sculptured arms to my sad shade. 

                               From the French of Paul Valry





"Poetry rejoices..."
 

Poetry rejoices even if the culture dies, 
over the girl with her first electric, how her high, 
thin voice, amplified many times 
over by the loudspeaker, is like a giant's 
in the green grass of the festival site. 
Over the fragile bells of digitalis, how they hide 
the pistil and the pollen inside. 
Rejoices over rain on the Faroe Islands, 
over rendezvous on the Champs-Elyses at evening. 
It rejoices over Japan, over Korea, 
over arts refined over a thousand years-- 
the art of swordsmanship, or of drinking tea. 
Rejoices over the poet, that his heart still beats.





Your Hair of Snakes and Flowers
 

When I saw one of those men touch your hair,   
I heard for the first time in many a year 
the ancient battle trumpets and I saw 
the banners of an army winding off to war 
and felt that blind power urging me to knock 
him out with one punch, send him tumbling to the floor. 
If nobody had held me back, stopped me,   
I would--God help me--have killed him on the spot, 
stomped out his blood, and spit in it. I'm sorry, 
but you must be aware your winding hair   
is different now, a hornets' nest, a snakes' lair! 
Yes, like a ball of snakes in a flower basket, dear.





The Crane Dance
 

The clew paying out through his fingers, a deftness   
that would bring him back to her, its softness the softness   
of skin, as if drawn from herself directly, the faint   
labial smell, guiding him up and out, as some dampness   
on the air might lead a stone-blind man to the light. 

Asterios dead for sure, his crumpled horn, his muzzle   
thick with blood, so at Delos they stopped,   
Theseus and the young Athenians, and stepped   
up to the "altar of horns" to dance a puzzle- 
dance, its moves unreadable except to those who'd walked   
the blank meanders of the labyrinth.   
And this was midday: a fierce sun, the blaze   
of their nakedness, the glitter of repetitions, a dazzle   
rising off the sea, the scents of pine and hyacinth. . . 

Well, things change: new passions, new threats, new fears.   
New consequences, too. Nowadays, we don't think much   
about Theseus, the Minotaur, Ariadne on the beach   
at Naxos, staring out at the coming years.   
But people still dance that dance: just common folk,   
those criss-cross steps that no one had to teach,   
at weddings and wakes, in bars or parks,   
as if hope and heart could meet, as if they might   
even now, somehow, dance themselves out of the dark.





In Memoriam, July 19, 1914
 

We aged a hundred years and this descended 
In just one hour, as at a stroke. 
The summer had been brief and now was ended; 
The body of the ploughed plains lay in smoke. 

The hushed road burst in colors then, a soaring 
Lament rose, ringing silver like a bell. 
And so I covered up my face, imploring 
God to destroy me before battle fell. 

And from my memory the shadows vanished 
Of songs and passions--burdens I'd not need. 
The Almighty bade it be--with all else banished-- 
A book of portents terrible to read.





"Our sweet companions-sharing your bunk and your bed"
 

Our sweet companions--sharing your bunk and your bed 
The versts and the versts and the versts and a hunk of your bread 
The wheels' endless round 
The rivers, streaming to ground   
The road. . . 

Oh the heavenly the Gypsy the early dawn light 
Remember the breeze in the morning, the steppe silver-bright 
Wisps of blue smoke from the rise 
And the song of the wise   
Gypsy czar. . . 

In the dark midnight, under the ancient trees' shroud 
We gave you sons as perfect as night, sons 
As poor as the night 
And the nightingale chirred   
Your might. . . 

We never stopped you, companions for marvelous hours 
Poverty's passions, the impoverished meals we shared 
The fierce bonfire's glow 
And there, on the carpet below,   
Fell stars. . .





The Trees Delete Themselves Inside a Fog-Sphere
 

In the fog which surrounds the trees, the leaves are stripped--leaves defaced already by slow oxidation, deadened by the sap's out-seeping for flowers' and fruits' gain, since the harsh heats of August made of them a less. 

In the bark, vertical furrows crease and slit where dampness drains to the earth's base, indifferent to the living citizens of the trunk. 

Flowers scattered, fruit conferred. Since youth, this relinquishing of breathing attributes and body parts has become for the trees a standard practice.

Loners
 

The door-latch is always stubborn 
beyond it dozes a beast 
tinged by the fire 
they know who is walking 
the curve of the road 
by their footsteps alone 
glance at the fancy lamp 
hanging from the sooty ceiling 
a green and speckled plant withers 
a child who has wandered cries 
beneath a long low sky 
and at last the snow comes on.





San Biagio, at Montepulciano
 

Columns, arches, vaults: how he knew 
The ways you promise what you lack; 
And that your bodies, like your souls, 
Always slip from our grasping hands. 

Space is such a lure . . . Swift to disappoint, 
As they raise and topple clouds, the sky's 
Architects still offer more than ours, 
Who only build a scaffolding of dreams. 

He dreamed, all the same; but on that day, 
He gave a better use to beauty's shapes: 
He understood that form means to die. 

And this, his final work, is a coin 
With both sides bare. He made in stone, 
Of this great room, the arrow and the bow.





Creative Writing
 

On the express train to Vienna 
she writes in her diary 
notes about Rome and Naples. 

Ink marks like parthenogenetic aphids, 
pages like blood smears 
of homing pigeons. 

She is alone, gray, reconciled, 
a Leda long after the swan's departure, 
Odysseus retired at Lotophagitis. 

Back home, in Maryland, 
the notebook will be interred 
in the archetypal drawer, 

among the yellowed love letters, 
among the infant hair curls, 
among the dried adult flowers, 

near the cushion where the castrated cat dreams 
while Mahler's forever forever forever 
chokes in the green wallpaper. 

It is her message to imagined little sons; 
it is her membership in the club 
of Swifts, Goethes, Rimbauds, Horatiuses and   
                                          deathwatch beetles. 

It is her monument outlasting bronze, 
five-dimensional reality, the last engraving 
of primeval man on reindeer bone, 

the last drop 
of the fluid soul 
before evaporation.





The Rape of Europa
 

From "Metamorphoses," Book II, 846-875
Majesty is incompatible truly with love; they cohabit 
Nowhere together. The father and chief of the gods, whose right hand is   
Armed with the triple-forked lightning, who shakes the whole world with a nod, laid   
Dignity down with his sceptre, adopting the guise of a bull that   
Mixed with the cattle and lowed as he ambled around the fresh fields, a   
Beautiful animal, colored like snow that no footprint has trodden   
And which no watery south wind has melted. His muscular neck bulged,   
Dewlaps hung down from his chin; his curved horns you might think had been hand carved,   
Perfect, more purely translucent than pearl. His unthreatening brow and   
Far from formidable eyes made his face appear tranquil. Agenor's   
Daughter was truly amazed that this beautiful bull did not seem to   
Manifest any hostility. Though he was gentle she trembled at first to   
Touch him, but soon she approached him, adorning his muzzle with flowers.   
Then he rejoiced as a lover and, while he looked forward to hoped for   
Pleasures, he slobbered all over her hands, and could hardly postpone the   
Joys that remained. So he frolicked and bounded about on the green grass,   
Laying his snowy-white flanks on the yellowish sands. As her fear was 
Little by little diminished, he offered his chest for her virgin   
Hand to caress and his horns to be decked with fresh flowers. The royal   
Maiden, not knowing on whom she was sitting, was even so bold as   
Also to climb on the back of the bull. As the god very slowly   
Inched from the shore and the dry land he planted his spurious footprints   
Deep in the shallows. Thus swimming out farther, he carried his prey off   
Into the midst of the sea. Almost fainting with terror she glanced back,   
As she was carried away, at the shore left behind. As she gripped one   
Horn in her right hand while clutching the back of the beast with the other,   
Meanwhile her fluttering draperies billowed behind on the sea breeze.





"Phoebus was gone, all gone, his journey over"
 

Phoebus was gone, all gone, his journey over. 
His sister was riding high: nothing bridled her. 
Her light was falling, shining into woods and rivers. 
Wild animals opened their jaws wide, stirred to prey. 
But in the human world all was sleep, pause, relaxation, torpor. 

One night, in an April which had just gone by, 
The likeness of my love stood beside me suddenly. 
He called my name so quietly. He touched me gently. 
His voice was drowning in tears. It failed completely. 
His sighs overwhelmed him. Finally, he could not speak clearly. 

I shuddered at his touch. I felt the fear of it. 
I trembled as if I knew the true terror of it. 
I opened my arms wide and pressed him against my body. 
Then I froze: I was ice, all ice. My blood drained into it. 
He had fled. Here was my embrace--and there was nothing in it. 

Fully awake now, I cried out loudly: 
"Where are you fleeing to? Why are you rushing away? 
Wait, wait for me. If you want, I can enter there. 
Because the truth is, I want to live with you forever." 
But soon I regretted it--that I had spoken out this way. 

And all the time, the windows of the terrace had been wide open.   
The light of the moon poured down; its beauty, its radiance. 
And I grieved and grieved. I grieved for so long. 
The tears flowed down my cheeks: tributaries of tears. 
It was a whole day before I could stop weeping.





Wasps
 

Where are you wandering to, little fools 
Come, big sister will teach you how to write verse 
Itchy little wasps sucking rotting flowers 
Horny baby lambkins butting gaps in the fence





Snail
 

Mother and father gave birth to a snail 
Night and day I crawl in smelly weeds 
Dear prince, if you love me, unfasten my door 
Stop, don't poke your finger up my tail!





Jackfruit
 

My body is like a jackfruit swinging on a tree 
My skin is rough, my pulp is thick 
Dear prince, if you want me pierce me upon your stick 
Don't squeeze, I'll ooze and stain your hands





Floating Sweet Dumpling
 

My body is powdery white and round 
I sink and bob like a mountain in a pond 
The hand that kneads me is hard and rough 
You can't destroy my true red heart





Lamenting Widow
 

A woman wails, boo hoo, mourning her man 
Shut up, shame on you, don't cry to the hills! 
O little sister, I should have warned you 
Don't eat the meat, if it makes you cough blood!





from For the Fighting Spirit of the Walnut
 

          
          108  In a decidedly vacant stone plaza, you are tapped on the shoulder by the convulsions of a section of light, and turn back, to your delight. However, to think that the countless hidden fibers of the atmosphere were already attacking you at once and tying you up, shadow and all. Inside the convulsive laughter, fight. Because the fighting spirit is that of the enemy, flooding over the plaza.
        




Mu'allaqa
 

A tribute
The elephant's trunk uncurling   
From the lightning flashes 
In the clouds was Marie Antoinette, 
As usual trumpeting. 
The greedy suction 
Was her tornado vacuuming across the golden Kansas flatness. 

Meanwhile, the count was talking to the swan. 
The swan liked what he was saying and got   
Right out of the pond. 
Meanwhile, grown men in Afghanistan. 
The count had fought in Algeria.   
Meanwhile, neon in Tokyo. 

Madame la Comtesse waved to us from the top step, 
Waved to her count, their swan, their ornamental pond, et moi. 
We were a towering cornucopia   
Of autumn happiness   
And gourmandise rotating counterclockwise, 
Backwards toward the guillotine. 

I kept a rainbow as a pet and grandly 
Walked the rainbow on a leash. 
I exercised it evenings together with the cheetah, 
A Thorstein Veblen moment of conspicuous consumption: 
A dapper dauphin in a T-shirt that said FRED 
Parading with his pets decked out in T-shirts that said FRED'S. 

I left my liver in the Cher. 
I ate my heart out en Berry. 
We drank and ate 
France between the wars, 
And every morning couldn't wait. 
It felt sunshiny in the shadow of the chteau. 

And when the rainbow leapt from there to here, 
It landed twenty years away from the Cher. 
The place it landed was the Persian Gulf. 
It landed twinkling stardust where I'm standing in my life 
With one-hump Marie Antoinette, my wife, 
Who resembles that disarming camel yesterday. 

In fact, the camel yesterday was smitten. 
She left the other camels to come over. 
You have a lovely liquid wraparound eye. 
She stood there looking at me sideways. 
They feed their racing camels caviar in Qatar.   
The ruler of Dubai has said that he will try to buy Versailles. 

A refrigerated ski slope, five stories high, 
Lives improbably inside a downtown shopping mall in Dubai. 
Arab men, wearing sneakers under their robes, hold hands. 
Faceless black veils stop shopping to watch through the glass. 
Seeing the skiers emphasizes the desert, 
Like hearing far-off thunder at a picnic. 

Both the word thunder and the word picnic are of course Arabic. 
Indeed, Arabic was the language of French aristocrats 
Before the Terror, bad body odor perfumed. 
It is the language of the great Robert Frost poems, 
Which have the suicide bomber's innocence 
Walking safely past the checkpoint into the crowd. 

They pay payola to Al Qaeda to stay away from Doha. 
The emir was in his counting-house, counting out his oil and gas. 
Another sunny Sunni day in the UAE! 
A candidate for president 
Who wants to manumit our oil-dependent nation 
First has to get the message to every oily girl and boy 

To just say no to up and down and in and out, Labanotation 
Of moaning oil rigs extracting oil joy. 
My fellow Americans, I see a desert filled with derricks   
Pumping up and down but never satisfied: 
Obsessional hydraulics and Jimi Hendrix has hysterics. 
I smash my guitar to bits on stage and that's all, folks! 

It isn't. 
I contemplate the end of the world. It isn't. 
I have my croissant and caf and the Trib and walk the rainbow 
Around the block.   
The young North African hipsters in the bitter banlieues 
Contemplate the end of the world. 

I contemplate the end of the world but in my case 
It's not. 
There are still things to buy. 
I walk the rainbow in the dark. 
The world is the kiosk where I get my Herald Tribune. 
The world is my local caf where my caf au lait is quadroon. 

I go to the strange little statue of Pierre Mends-France 
In the Jardin du Luxembourg, in Paris, France. 
I make a pilgrimage to it. 
My quaint political saint and I visit. 
The young North African hipsters in the bitter banlieues 
Contemplate the end of the world, which isn't 

The end of the world, though yes, quite true, 
In Algeria and Afghanistan 
Jihad is developing a dirty nuclear bomb 
That smells like frangipani in flower 
To keep Frangipani in power.   
Ayatollah Frangipani has returned from his long exile in France   

To annihilate vice. 
I stomp the campfire out and saddle up my loyal Mayflower-- 
Who is swifter than a life is brief under the stars! 
My prize four-wheel-drive with liquid wraparound eyes! 
We ski the roller coaster ocean's up and down dunes. 
We reach land at last and step on Plymouth Rock.





Tigris Song
 

Moringa of the flood bed 
on the banks of the river Tigris. 

A dove on a swaying bough's mournful cooing 
has turned me sad, 

Her song like the song 
of the queen of the gathering-- 

When she touches her triple chord   
you can forget the maestro brother of the caliph al-Hdi! 

And when she sings!--who was njash 
that camel driver with the mesmerizing chant, anyway? 

In Hadimt, Slma's direction, 
and Sindd, I swear it, 

I'm in love, far gone, 
with a girl who lives in jyadi.   

Wrong, she lives in the obsidian black 
of the membrane of my liver. 

Through her, in a rush of musk   
and saffron, beauty falls   
into disarray.





Baghdad Song
 

Oh, for corniced palace of Baghdad! not 
the palatial cornices of Sindd al-Hra-- 

It crowns the gardens cascading below,   
a virgin unveiled in a perfumed chamber. 

Wind plays in the branches. They bend. 
Lovers at last coming together. 

Her neck necklaced by the river Tigris, 
her lord our master our Imm al-Hdi, 

Nsir, Mansr, best of caliphs, 
who never set out on horseback to war. 

God bless him long   
as a dove on a swaying bough's cooing, 

Long as smiles flash lightning 
(and eyes stream like clouds in answer) 

From a bride like the sun when the mist parts, 
revealing herself luminous in splendor.





What is it to be human?
 

What is staying alive? To possess   
A great hall inside of a cell. 
What is it to know? The same root 
Underneath the branches. 

What is it to believe? Being a carer   
Until relief takes over. 
And to forgive? On fours through thorns 
To keep company to an old enemy. 

What is it to sing? To receive breath 
From the genius of creation. 
What's work but humming a song 
From wood and wheat. 

What are state affairs? A craft 
That's still only crawling? 
And armaments? Thrust a knife 
In a baby's fist. 

Being a nation? What can it be? A gift 
In the swell of the heart. 
And to love a country? Keeping house 
In a cloud of witnesses. 

What's the world to the all powerful? 
A circle spinning. 
And to the children of the earth? 
A cradle rocking. 






Up on Top
 

After stumbling a long time over impossible trails   
you are up on top.   
Hardship didn't crush you, you trod it   
down, climbed higher. 

That's how you see it. After life has tossed you   
away, and you ended up on top   
like a one-legged wooden horse on a dump.   
Life is merciful, it blinds and provides illusions,   
and destiny takes on our burden:   
foolishness and arrogance become mountains and marshy places,   
hate and resentment become wounds from enemy arrows,   
and the doubt always with us becomes cold dry 
rocky valleys. 

You go in the door.   
The pot lies upside down in the hearth,   
it sprawls with hostile black feet.





Barley Field
 

An old woodcut of the London Bridge   
and a colored lithograph of a barley field.   
There are no other pictures on Ward D. 

The London Bridge lifts sooty towers above the river.   
But it's the barley field I see.   
A golden ocean of barley. 

It's not like the other grain-fields.   
Maybe it's those inward-looking eyes   
gone into it so it becomes heaven? 

A fall-colored sky, mild,   
with no harvesters and no scythes.





Charms for Love
 

I beat you with a hazel rod 
Come to me in madness 

I beat you with a bloodied rod 
Come like an angel 

I beat you with a rod from heaven 
Come to me like a wild boar 

*       *       * 

Ninety-nine serpents-- 
ninety-nine flaming beasts-- 
go to Ion 
Slip in by his shirt-collar 
squat in his heart 
scald him burn him   
turn his eyes to my eyes 
his face to my face 
his path to my house 
Make him see me in the distance 
a fine-feathered peacock   
make him pick me out as basil among weeds 
make him tease me among the girls 
Like following gold and silver 
fall in step with my words 
with my walk   
with my dance 

*       *       * 

Sweet boy 
don't send so much longing-- 
send a little less 
and come with it yourself 

*       *       * 

Tuesday, basket full of black, 
how did you make me fall in love-- 
did you clip my hair 
did you steal my footsteps? 
How did you charm me-- 
with the hair of a mad wolf 
with three straws from the bed 
with splintered wood   
with the fairness of eyebrows 
with a chip off the gate 
with dark hair from a braid? 
How drive every other love away? 

*       *       * 

Eagle, eagle, grow into a flying bird 
Take yourself to Ion's house 
What you find in his head   
take in your head 
what you find in his ears   
take in your ears 
what you find in his mouth   
take in your mouth 
what you find in his hands   
take in your wings 
Take that great wrong away in your feathers-- 

and what you find in your head   
put it in her head 
And what you find in your feathers   
put it on the table   
in their house





To His Lady
 

Beloved beauty who inspires 
love in me from afar, your face obscured   
except when your celestial image   
stirs my heart in sleep, or in the fields 
where light and nature's laughter shine more lovely-- 
was it maybe you who blessed 
the innocent age called golden, 
and do you now, blithe spirit,   
fly among men? Or does that miser fate 
who hides you from us save you for the future? 

No hope of seeing you alive   
remains for me now, 
except when, naked and alone, 
my soul will go down a new street   
to its unknown home. Already at the dawn 
of my dark, uncertain day 
I imagined you a fellow traveler 
on this arid ground. But there's no thing 
that resembles you on earth. And if someone 
had a face like yours, in act and word she'd be, 
though something like you, far less beautiful. 

In spite of all the suffering 
fate decreed for human time, 
if there were anyone on earth 
who truly loved you as my thought depicts you, 
this life for him would be a blessing. 
And I see clearly how your love 
would lead me still to strive for praise and virtue, 
as I used to in my early years. 
Though heaven gave no comfort for our troubles, 
yet with you mortal life would be 
like what in heaven leads to divinity. 

In the valleys, where the song 
of the weary farmer sounds, 
and when I sit and mourn   
the illusions of youth fading, 
and on the hills where I recall   
and grieve for my lost desires   
and my life's lost hope, I think of you 
and start to shake. If only I, in this   
sad age and unhealthy atmosphere, 
could keep hold of your noble look; for since the real thing's 
missing I must make do with the image. 

Whether you are the only one   
of the eternal ideas eternal wisdom 
refuses to see arrayed in sensible form 
to know the pains of mortal life 
in transitory spoils, 
or if in the supernal spheres another earth 
from among unnumbered worlds receives you 
and a near star lovelier than the Sun 
warms you and you breathe benigner ether, 
from here, where years are both ill-starred and brief, 
accept this hymn from your unnoticed lover.





Immortal Instant
 

The sniper at work over the street corner acts. 
Two girls, breathless after the dash across, 
radiate heat and bouquets, as when ironing 
silken delicates. With one, in place of a chignon, 
goosefleshed Christmas wheat. She explodes, rages,   
curses the sniper; at the window, seemingly, 
I'm watching a beautiful storm. From the other, words 
like a sun-umbrella's flutterings, in the morning, 
on an Adriatic beach. Now and again, she flicks her head 
back: just for us. As she well knows: flicked hair 
sweetens the air. Beauty, always forthcoming, never   
misses a half-smile. As they well know: making us happy 
costs them nothing. Those half-smiles saying 
you aren't just one fact among others--not at all, 
not for them--even banishing the hex of that fact 
if any other woman's glacial look had magicked it up. 
The air smelt strongly of my distant youth 
when every boulevard led to the end of the world,   
when life was not yet "threadbare as a proverb." 
Now they're going, leaving such tenderness in me 
as engulfs you when looking too long at the heavens   
into which snowflakes are swarming. 
So they disappeared chattering, not girls 
but breezes, blown lightly, surprisingly,   
through the St. John's heat of siege. The St. John's heat   
of being.





Black Stone on a White Stone
 

I will die in Paris with a rainstorm, 
on a day I already remember, 
I will die in Paris--and I don't shy away-- 
perhaps on a Thursday, as today is, in autumn. 

       It will be Thursday, because today, Thursday, as I prose 
these lines, I've put on my humeri in a bad mood,   
and, today like never before, I've turned back, 
with all of my road, to see myself alone. 

       Csar Vallejo has died; they kept hitting him,   
everyone, even though he does nothing to them, 
they gave it to him hard with a club and hard 

       also with a rope; witnesses are 
the Thursday days and the humerus bones,   
the solitude, the rain, the roads. . . 






Miguel
 

I'm sitting here on the old patio 
beside your absence. It is a black well. 
We'd be playing, now. . . I can hear Mama yell   
"Boys! Calm down!" We'd laugh, and off I'd go   
to hide where you'd never look. . . under the stairs,   
in the hall, the attic. . . Then you'd do the same. 
Miguel, we were too good at that game.   
Everything would always end in tears. 

No one was laughing on that August night 
you went to hide away again, so late 
it was almost dawn. But now your brother's through 
with this hunting and hunting and never finding you. 
The shadows crowd him. Miguel, will you hurry   
and show yourself? Mama will only worry.





Because of this Modest Style
 

September 14, 1915
It's how she spreads, without a sound, her scent 
of orange blossom on the dark of me, 
it is the way she shrouds in mourning black   
her mother-of-pearl and ivory, the way 
she wears the lace ruff at her throat, and how 
she turns her face, quite voiceless, self-possessed,   
because she takes the language straight to heart,   
is thrifty with the words she speaks. 
                                                                                                 It's how   
she is so reticent yet welcoming 
when she comes out to face my panegyrics, 
the way she says my name 
mocking and mimicking, makes gentle fun, 
yet she's aware that my unspoken drama 
is really of the heart, though a little silly; 
it's how, when night is deep and at its darkest, 
we linger after dinner, vaguely talking 
and her laughing smile grows fainter and then falls 
gently on the tablecloth; it's the teasing way 
she won't give me her arm and then allows 
deep feeling to come with us when we walk out, 
promenading on the hot colonial boulevard. . . 

Because of this, your sighing, modest style 
of love, I worship you, my faithful star 
who like to cloud yourself about in mourning, 
generous, hidden blossom; kindly 
mellowness who have presided over   
my thirty years with the self-denying singleness   
a vase has, whose half-blown roses wreathe with scent 
the headboard of a convalescent man; 
cautious nurse, shy 
serving maid, dear friend who trembles 
with the trembling of a child when you revise 
the reading that we share; apprehensive, always timid 
guest at the feast I give; my ally, 
humble dove that coos when it is morning 
in a minor key, a key that's wholly yours. 

May you be blessed, modest, magnificent; 
you have possessed the highest summit of my heart, 
you who are at once the artist   
of lowly and most lofty things, who bear in your hands 
my life as if it was your work of art! 

O star and orange blossom, may you dwindle 
gently rocked in an unwedded peace, 
and may you fade out like a morning star 
which the lightening greenness of a meadow darkens 
or like a flower that finds transfiguration 
on the blue west, as it might on a simple bed.





Day in Autumn
 

After the summer's yield, Lord, it is time 
to let your shadow lengthen on the sundials 
and in the pastures let the rough winds fly. 

As for the final fruits, coax them to roundness. 
Direct on them two days of warmer light 
to hale them golden toward their term, and harry 
the last few drops of sweetness through the wine. 

Whoever's homeless now, will build no shelter; 
who lives alone will live indefinitely so, 
waking up to read a little, draft long letters,   
and, along the city's avenues, 
fitfully wander, when the wild leaves loosen.





The Beggars
 

You didn't know 
what was in the heap. A visitor found 
it to contain beggars. They sell the hollow 
of their hands. 

They show the sightseer 
their mouths full of filth, 
and let him (he can afford it) peer 
at the mange eating away at them. 

In their twisted vision 
his stranger's face is skewed; 
they are pleased with their accession, 
and when he speaks they spew.





The Song of the Birds
 

At the sight of 
the great light dawning   
in that glad night, 
small birds come singing 
to celebrate him 
with their sweet voices. 

And even the imperial 
eagle, soaring on the wind, 
sings a melodious song, 
saying:   Jesus is born 
to lift us from sin 
and bring us joy.





From the Artist's Sketchbook
 

Perfectly round. 
                      Perfectly black. 
No. . . not entirely black. 
He has that bluish-white at the edge of his eyes 
And his beautiful lips 
Open upon a smile of expensive pearls. 

*       *       * 

Round and dusky-headed, 
Round bellied 
Black baby, fearlessly 
Offer your unpristine hand to the daylight, 
Say hello, fearlessly, to your life.





In the Lake Region
 

When you open the door, everything falls into place-- 
the little ferry by the wharf, fir trees and thujas.   
An old woman, feeding ducks, seems as old as Leni   
Riefenstahl. At the base of the hill, chestnut trees, not yet in full bloom,   
are younger--but probably as old as her films.   
All is wet and bright. A hedgehog or God-knows-whose-soul   
is rummaging in last year's leaves. Dead water and living water   
fill the plain. The twins Celsius and Fahrenheit   
are predicting spring weather--while a shadow obscures   
the past (just like the present). The first serene weeks scour the bridges   
in a peaceful corner of Europe between Wannsee and Potsdam--where   
much has happened, but, probably, nothing more will.   
For days we have been watching a ragged crow--in the garden,   
sometimes on the roof. The ancients would have said her   
stubbornness augurs something. Emerging from the wood's   
depths, she lights on one antenna crossbar   
then another, her surface bright as mercury   
in a thermometer's glass. But these are fever marks   
we are incapable of understanding. The beginning of agony?   
The past does not enlighten us--but still, it attempts   
to say something. Perhaps the crow knows more about us   
and about history's dirt than we do ourselves.   
Of what does she want to remind us? Of the black photos, the black headphones 
of radio operators, black signatures under documents,   
of the unarmed with their frozen pupils--of the prisoner's boot or the trunk   
of the refugee? Probably not. We will remember this anyway,   
though it won't make us any wiser. The bird signifies only stoicism   
and patience. If you ask for them, your request will be granted.





Ardors
 

The tortoise walks on tiptoe in June, 
the month of his ardors.
Buttery light, distant thunder
in the month of my ardors.
                                                              _
 
Flailing boughs, coral lime 
in the wind and verdure. 
Then silence, dark creamy 
shadows in nighttime verdure. 
                                                              _
 
The moon traversing the garden,
florals made of a blush or a breath, 
nightbirds with a little lump
of insect under their tongues, breath 
                                                              _
 
of clover, grassy, spiced, 
and all of it rinsed of emotion. 
The leaden nymph by the gate. 
All, all rinsed of emotion. 
                                                              _
 
By what bough are the fireflies 
hidden, and the stars? 
The night's leavings in daylight 
lie hidden like the stars.





The Gross Clinic
 

I have a sister who takes care of animals, whose artistry is flesh
and blood mixed in with a dream or more
she tries to give her son. He cuts school and drinks with his friends
in the scrub woods behind the school. He thinks he wants to be an 
 architect;        
he thinks the poems he writes are portions of his unmixed spirit.
His habits of mind aren't settled, ossifying so slowly for many of us,
we can't know, and no one can tell him anything about cigarettes,
bad drugs, his fragile mortal spiral.

He can't cry anymore--it's the wrong style of feeling--,
and he only half knows that like his mother he will have to descend
before he can break into nakedness, as if from the warmed surface
of loam, from slug-soft matter that breathes or suppurates.

My nephew Samuel has the same name as the son of the famous 
surgeon       
Dr. Gross, painted by the American realist Thomas Eakins.
Samuel chugs gin, takes his tokes, and helps his mother with preps--
a Betadine swabbing, "like a ritual, out from the site of the incision.
He confuses his mother. In this poem I want to try to stand
at their shoulders in the clinic. I think I could come near to swooning
from the obscene odor in the air, but I can try to imagine
something beyond the surgery, the fur and the glistening
blood, and I wouldn't leave them.

--

The flight of gray gulls over the bay
accompanied my early wrestling with flesh, "Blue Suede Shoes
playing on the radio in my parents' house.
The fluency, then, of hands and lips threw seeds of a sweeter
and more luxuriant fluency when I was thirty.

Then I believed in the beauty of Helen
and sometimes, as the fullest truth, in the colored clouds
above apple trees full of blossoms and the reddened fruit afterwards.
In the end, of course, the fruit turns to mash, and wasps
burrow drunkenly in the meat no longer crisp.

--

There is a terrible beauty in the speeches of Nestor
after Agamemnon has called out the spirit of his army
by inviting them to go home. Imagine the sober tones
of the generals and the old king, his face a lifelong gallery
of portraits, grizzled hair an aura, as he faces

them with his counsel. From his lips a kind of honey
mixing with the bitterness of those two quarreling.
He asks them for their mettle, earth born, and leans,
foreshortened, his robe exposing a scarred and whitened chest.

A vignette of what we cannot learn, or outlast.

--

One who loves earth and the sun and animals
stands over the necrotic thigh of a wolfhound
with scapel and rongeur, a patina of antiseptic
reddening the bare skin around the wound. The odors are a mixture
of rotted flowers and fruit and the beautiful blood oozing from an 
incision       
above a honeycomb of maggots, swollen, moving.
If you can bear to stand close and look closely at the dissection,
you will feel your own stomach turn and your nerves
grow a little cleaner, and you may feel puzzled how a person
would want to know that much anatomy.

Wasn't it like this for Michelangelo?
This lesson of body? And the artist's revulsion, someone trying
to look beyond heroic contours of ruined flesh--
softness of hip and buttocks--into the serum of spirit?

To live while another no longer can live.
This flesh and that muscle, and tinted spring forests, and mausoleums.





Sole Blessing
 

To say screw them, to be screw-them 
bent on one thing all but lost, 
one music or mystery, 
beyond all the necessary 
incidental snaggings of the heart; 

to train the whole soul's beam 
on a solitary hill, or on it 
a special kind of rock or creeper; 
to be sated just by saxophone; 
to want nothing but your eyes 

lifelong to study Scottish otters: 
the snub, slippery-whiskered snout; 
the way they intertwine in threes 
at play, indistinguishably bound, 
long sleek backs submerging away... 

To make of this your being's aim, 
its joy, and know by pulse and viscus 
the word joy. No gifts but thine 
to thyself: thou canst, if thou list, 
single out, make good, one wish. 

This from the dumb lips of an old god 
who with one endless, misty hand 
holds out to us too much to love, 
and with the other--crooked-fingered, 
crazed with veins--some nights and days.





Together
 

All my life 
I was face to face 
with her, at meal-times, 
by the fire, even 
in the ultimate intimacies 
of the bed. You could have asked, 
then, for information 
about her? There was a room 
apart she kept herself in, 
teasing me by leading me 
to its glass door, only 
to confront me with 
my reflection. I learned from her 
even so. Walking her shore 
I found things cast up 
from her depths that spoke 
to me of another order, 
worshipper as I was 
of untamed nature. She fetched 
her treasures from art's 
storehouse: pieces of old 
lace, delicate as frost; 
china from a forgotten 
period; a purse more valuable 
than anything it could contain. 
Coming in from the fields 
with my offering of flowers 
I found her garden 
had forestalled me in providing 
civilities for my desk. 
Tell me about life,' 
I would say, you who were 
its messenger in the delivery 
of our child.' Her eyes had a 
fine shame, remembering her privacy 
being invaded from further off than 
she expected. Do you think 
death is the end?' frivolously 
I would ask her. I recall 
now the swiftness of its arrival 
wrenching her lip down, and how 
the upper remained firm, 
reticent as the bud that is 
the precursor of the flower.





Vestibule
 

What etiquette holds us back 
from more intimate speech, 
especially now, at the end of the world? 
Can't we begin a conversation 
here in the vestibule, 
then gradually move it inside? 
What holds us back 
from saying things outright? 
We've killed the earth. 
Yet we speak of other things. 
Our words should cauterize 
all wounds to the truth.





Why Nobody Pets the Lion at the Zoo
 

The morning that the world began

The Lion growled a growl at Man.


And I suspect the Lion might

(If he'd been closer) have tried a bite.


I think that's as it ought to be

And not as it was taught to me.


I think the Lion has a right

To growl a growl and bite a bite.


And if the Lion bothered Adam,

He should have growled right back at 'im.


The way to treat a Lion right

Is growl for growl and bite for bite.


True, the Lion is better fit

For biting than for being bit.


But if you look him in the eye

You'll find the Lion's rather shy.


He really wants someone to pet him.

The trouble is: his teeth won't let him.


He has a heart of gold beneath

But the Lion just can't trust his teeth.





Tormented
 

Enormous solids were falling 
from who knows what heights, 
who knows what places. 
I trembled, 
and in my mouth 
an inky taste. Precise. 

Hail, maybe, 
enormous kernels of ice; 
coming down, 
with a scandalous impact, 
didn't bury me, terrorized, 
under the covers. 
It didn't happen, it wasn't that. 

A below zero temperature   
circulated through the soft center of my bones. 
A truly searing cold.   

Nothing having to do with monsters came to pass. 
Nothing to do with interminable distances. 
No brutal incidents. 
Only the agony of acorns. 
Only a cycle that completes itself 
every few years 
and transforms into a tropical forest 
a choiring oak grove.   

Which is the fear.





Memories Are a House
 

Stars by the power of their orbit 
are stars in the order of the sun. 
But if they are not figures of orbit, 
they are not in the sun. 

Exactly like me: by the power of my yearnings   
I am in the family. 
And if I will not yearn, 
I am not in the family. 

Memories are a house. 
Time is a roof. All the time a roof. All the time time. 
I would like sometime to die 
unto them and see them. 

Benno Rothenberg related 
that when he saw some archaeology, 
he had a feeling of 
homeland. As if he were in his house. 

I do not deny that a man who reaches a certain age 
can no longer hope 
that those from whom he came will remain 
still alive with him, as my mother once 

wrote to me in one of the letters   
of her twilight. From the fadings of her letters 
into the fatedness of man: But when can they.   
After all there's no chance of seeing you. 

And once, in a discarded and forgotten letter: 
"Good night, Yehiel alter lebn. Slumber has descended upon me. 
I am caught in the throes of sleep. Khbin 
shlayferig gevorn." Said in a letter that nobody reads, that nobody read. 

--February 8, 1989





The Son of the Wall
 

The Christian cannot   
be the pitying one 
because he is 
the one pitied. 

From a dusty road 
in a straight line 
from przedmiescie to Krasnystaw 
at the entrance to town 

at Zhitkovski's   
in his house we lived, 
he makes coffins 
with crosses. 

On the threshold 
I sat as a boy 
opposite a building 
held together by nails 

facing the church 
the cloister the impurity, 
my mother says, 
I sat as a boy. 

On the wall 
Jesus and Mary. 
Jesus and his mother 
were never parted. 

My mother's son 
left her 
not to be 
on the wall. 

Mary's son   
never left, 
and he paid 
the price. 

--October 26-29, 1989





To Put It Differently
 

Poetry chooses choice things, carefully selecting 
select words, arranging, 
fabulously, things arranged. To put it differently 
is hard, if not out of the question. 

Poetry's like a clay plate. It's broken easily 
under the weight of all those poems. In the hands 
of the poet, it sings. In those of others, not only 
doesn't it sing, it's out of the question.





"For years my heart inquired of me"
 

For years my heart inquired of me 
                   Where Jamshid's sacred cup might be, 
And what was in its own possession 
                   It asked from strangers, constantly; 
Begging the pearl that's slipped its shell 
                   From lost souls wandering by the sea. 

Last night I took my troubles to 
                   The Magian sage whose keen eyes see 
A hundred answers in the wine 
                   Whose cup he, laughing, showed to me. 
I questioned him, "When was this cup 
                   That shows the world's reality 

Handed to you?" He said, "The day 
                   Heaven's vault of lapis lazuli 
Was raised, and marvelous things took place 
                   By Intellect's divine decree, 
And Moses' miracles were made 
                   And Sameri's apostasy." 

He added then, "That friend they hanged   
                   High on the looming gallows tree-- 
His sin was that he spoke of things 
                   Which should be pondered secretly, 
The page of truth his heart enclosed 
                   Was annotated publicly. 

But if the Holy Ghost once more 
                   Should lend his aid to us we'd see 
Others perform what Jesus did-- 
                   Since in his heartsick anguish he 
Was unaware that God was there 
                   And called His name out ceaselessly." 

I asked him next, "And beauties' curls 
                   That tumble down so sinuously, 
What is their meaning? Whence do they come?" 
                   "Hafez," the sage replied to me, 
"It's your distracted, lovelorn heart 
                   That asks these questions constantly."





Lines for Winter
 

for Ros Krauss
Tell yourself 
as it gets cold and gray falls from the air 
that you will go on 
walking, hearing 
the same tune no matter where 
you find yourself-- 
inside the dome of dark 
or under the cracking white 
of the moon's gaze in a valley of snow. 
Tonight as it gets cold 
tell yourself 
what you know which is nothing 
but the tune your bones play 
as you keep going. And you will be able 
for once to lie down under the small fire 
of winter stars. 
And if it happens that you cannot 
go on or turn back 
and you find yourself 
where you will be at the end, 
tell yourself 
in that final flowing of cold through your limbs 
that you love what you are.





Blackberry-Picking
 

for Philip Hobsbaum
Late August, given heavy rain and sun 
For a full week, the blackberries would ripen. 
At first, just one, a glossy purple clot 
Among others, red, green, hard as a knot. 
You ate that first one and its flesh was sweet 
Like thickened wine: summer's blood was in it 
Leaving stains upon the tongue and lust for 
Picking. Then red ones inked up and that hunger 
Sent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-pots 
Where briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots. 
Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drills 
We trekked and picked until the cans were full, 
Until the tinkling bottom had been covered 
With green ones, and on top big dark blobs burned 
Like a plate of eyes. Our hands were peppered 
With thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's. 

We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre. 
But when the bath was filled we found a fur, 
A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache. 
The juice was stinking too. Once off the bush 
The fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour. 
I always felt like crying. It wasn't fair 
That all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot. 
Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not.





Selected Haiku by Issa
 

Don't worry, spiders, 
I keep house 
    casually. 


    New Year's Day-- 
everything is in blossom! 
    I feel about average. 


    The snow is melting 
and the village is flooded 
    with children. 


    Goes out,   
comes back-- 
    the love life of a cat. 


    Mosquito at my ear-- 
does he think   
    I'm deaf?   


    Under the evening moon 
the snail 
    is stripped to the waist. 


    Even with insects-- 
some can sing, 
   some can't.   


    All the time I pray to Buddha 
I keep on 
   killing mosquitoes. 


    Napped half the day; 
no one   
    punished me!





Snowmen
 

My ancestor, a man 
of Himalayan snow, 
came to Kashmir from Samarkand, 
carrying a bag 
of whale bones: 
heirlooms from sea funerals. 
His skeleton 
carved from glaciers, his breath 
arctic, 
he froze women in his embrace. 
His wife thawed into stony water, 
her old age a clear 
evaporation. 

This heirloom, 
his skeleton under my skin, passed 
from son to grandson, 
generations of snowmen on my back. 
They tap every year on my window, 
their voices hushed to ice. 

No, they won't let me out of winter, 
and I've promised myself, 
even if I'm the last snowman, 
that I'll ride into spring 
on their melting shoulders.





Lost and Found
 

          
          I am looking for the photo that would make all the difference in my life. It's very small and subject to fits of amnesia, turning up in poker hands, grocery carts, under the unturned stone. The photo shows me at the lost and found looking for an earlier photo, the one that would have made all the difference then. My past evades me like a politician. Wielding a fly-swatter, it destroys my collection of cereal boxes, my childhood lived close to the breakfast table. Only that photo can help me locate my fourteen lost children, who look just like me. When I call the Bureau of Missing Persons, they say, "Try the Bureau of Missing Photos. They have a fine collection. Here's one of Calvin Coolidge's seventh wedding. Here's one of a man going over a cliff on a dogsled. Here's my Uncle Arthur the night he bought the prize peacock. O photo! End your tour of the world in a hot air balloon. Resign your job at the mirror-testing laboratory. Come home to me, you little fool, before I find I can live without you.
        




Tornado Child
 

For Rosalie Richardson
I am a tornado child. 
         I come like a swirl of black and darken up your day; 
         I whip it all into my womb, lift you and your things, 
         carry you to where you've never been, and maybe, 
         if I feel good, I might bring you back, all warm and scared, 
         heart humming wild like a bird after early sudden flight. 

I am a tornado child. 
         I tremble at the elements. When thunder rolls my womb 
         trembles, remembering the tweak of contractions 
         that tightened to a wail when my mother pushed me out 
         into the black of a tornado night. 

I am a tornado child, 
         you can tell us from far, by the crazy of our hair; 
         couldn't tame it if we tried. Even now I tie a bandanna 
         to silence the din of anarchy in these coir-thick plaits. 

I am a tornado child 
         born in the whirl of clouds; the center crumbled, 
         then I came. My lovers know the blast of my chaotic giving; 
         they tremble at the whip of my supple thighs; 
         you cross me at your peril, I swallow light 
         when the warm of anger lashes me into a spin, 
         the pine trees bend to me swept in my gyrations. 

I am a tornado child. 
         When the spirit takes my head, I hurtle into the vacuum 
         of white sheets billowing and paint a swirl of color, 
         streaked with my many songs.

Weighing In
 

What the scale tells you is how much the earth 
has missed you, body, how it wants you back 
again after you leave it to go forth 

into the light. Do you remember how 
earth hardly noticed you then? Others would rock 
you in their arms, warm in the flow 

that fed you, coaxed you upright. Then earth began 
to claim you with spots and fevers, began to lick 
at you with a bruised knee, a bloody shin, 

and finally to stoke you, body, drumming 
intimate coded messages through music 
you danced to unawares, there in your dreaming 

and your poems and your obedient blood. 
Body, how useful you became, how lucky, 
heavy with news and breakage, rich, and sad, 

sometimes, imagining that greedy zero 
you must have been, that promising empty sack 
of possibilities, never-to-come tomorrow. 

But look at you now, body, soft old shoe 
that love wears when it's stirring, look down, look 
how earth wants what you weigh, needs what you know.





Shiver & You Have Weather
 

In the aftermath of calculus 
your toast fell butter-side down. 

Squirrels swarmed the lawns 
in flight patterns. The hovercraft 

helped the waves along. From 
every corner there was perspective. 

On the billboards the diamonds 
were real, in the stores, only zirconia. 

I cc'ed you. I let you know. 
Sat down to write the Black Ice Memo. 

Dinner would be meager & 
reminiscent of next week's lunch. 

So what if I sat on the sectional? 
As always I was beside myself.





The Heat of Autumn
 

The heat of autumn 
is different from the heat of summer.   
One ripens apples, the other turns them to cider.   
One is a dock you walk out on,   
the other the spine of a thin swimming horse 
and the river each day a full measure colder.   
A man with cancer leaves his wife for his lover. 
Before he goes she straightens his belts in the closet,   
rearranges the socks and sweaters inside the dresser 
by color. That's autumn heat: 
her hand placing silver buckles with silver,   
gold buckles with gold, setting each   
on the hook it belongs on in a closet soon to be empty,   
and calling it pleasure.   






The Inevitable
 

To have that letter arrive   
was like the mist that took a meadow   
and revealed hundreds   
of small webs once invisible   
The inevitable often   
stands by plainly but unnoticed   
till it hands you a letter   
that says death and you notice   
the weed field had been   
readying its many damp handkerchiefs   
all along





In the Meantime
 

What seemed a mystery was 
in fact a choice. Insert bird for sorrow.   

What seemed a memory was in fact 
a dividing line. Insert bird for wind.   

Insert wind for departure when everyone is 
standing still. Insert three mountains 

burning and in three valleys a signal seer 
seeing a distant light and a signal bearer 

sprinting to a far-off bell. What seemed 
a promise was in fact a sigh.   

What seemed a hot wind, a not quite enough,   
a forgive me, it has flown away, is in fact.   

In the meantime we paint the floors 
red. We stroke the sound of certain names 

into a fine floss that drifts across our teeth. 
We stay in the room we share and listen 

all night to what drifts through the window-- 
dog growl, owl call, a fleet of mosquitoes 

setting sail, and down the road,   
the swish of tomorrow's donkey-threshed grain.





Three Teenage Girls: 1956
 

Three teenage girls in tight red sleeveless blouses and black Capri pants   
And colorful headscarves secured in a knot to their chins   
Are walking down the hill, chatting, laughing,   
Cupping their cigarettes against the light rain,   
The closest to the road with her left thumb stuck out   
Not looking at the cars going past.   

Every Friday night to the dance, and wet or dry   
They get where they're going, walk two miles or get a ride,   
And now the two-door 1950 Dodge, dark green   
Darkening as evening falls, stops, they nudge   
Each other, peer in, shrug, two scramble into the back seat,   
And the third, the boldest, famous   
For twice running away from home, slides in front with the man   
Who reaches across her body and pulls the door shut.





Sumer is i-cumin in
 

Sing, cuccu, nu. Sing, cuccu.
Sing, cuccu. Sing, cuccu, nu.

Sumer is i-cumin in--
   Lhude sing, cuccu!
Groweth sed and bloweth med
   And springth the wude nu.
         Sing, cuccu! 

Awe bleteth after lomb,
   Lhouth after calve cu,
Bulluc sterteth, bucke verteth--
   Murie sing, cuccu!
         Cuccu, cuccu,
Wel singes thu, cuccu.
   Ne swik thu naver nu!





Lines Written in Early Spring
 

I heard a thousand blended notes, 
While in a grove I sate reclined, 
In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts 
Bring sad thoughts to the mind. 

To her fair works did Nature link 
The human soul that through me ran; 
And much it grieved my heart to think 
What man has made of man. 

Through primrose tufts, in that green bower, 
The periwinkle trailed its wreaths; 
And 'tis my faith that every flower 
Enjoys the air it breathes. 

The birds around me hopped and played, 
Their thoughts I cannot measure:-- 
But the least motion which they made 
It seemed a thrill of pleasure. 

The budding twigs spread out their fan, 
To catch the breezy air; 
And I must think, do all I can, 
That there was pleasure there. 

If this belief from heaven be sent, 
If such be Nature's holy plan, 
Have I not reason to lament 
What man has made of man?





Spring
 

Nothing is so beautiful as Spring           
   When weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;          
   Thrush's eggs look little low heavens, and thrush          
Through the echoing timber does so rinse and wring          
The ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing; 
   The glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush          
   The descending blue; that blue is all in a rush          
With richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.          

What is all this juice and all this joy?          
   A strain of the earth's sweet being in the beginning 
In Eden garden.  Have, get, before it cloy,          
   Before it cloud, Christ, lord, and sour with sinning,          
Innocent mind and Mayday in girl and boy,          
   Most, O maid's child, thy choice and worthy the winning.          







As I Ebbd with the Ocean of Life
 

                                             1 
As I ebb'd with the ocean of life, 
As I wended the shores I know, 
As I walk'd where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok, 
Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant, 
Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways, 
I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward, 
Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems, 
Was seiz'd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot, 
The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land of the globe. 

Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow those slender windrows, 
Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,   
Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the tide, 
Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me, 
Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses, 
These you presented to me you fish-shaped island, 
As I wended the shores I know, 
As I walk'd with that electric self seeking types. 


                                             2 
As I wend to the shores I know not, 
As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck'd, 
As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me, 
As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer, 
I too but signify at the utmost a little wash'd-up drift, 
A few sands and dead leaves to gather, 
Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift. 

O baffled, balk'd, bent to the very earth, 
Oppress'd with myself that I have dared to open my mouth, 
Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have not once had the least idea who or what I am, 
But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet untouch'd, untold, altogether unreach'd, 
Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows, 
With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written, 
Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath. 

I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single object, and that no man ever can, 
Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon me and sting me, 
Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all. 


                                             3 
You oceans both, I close with you, 
We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift, knowing not why, 
These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all. 

You friable shore with trails of debris, 
You fish-shaped island, I take what is underfoot, 
What is yours is mine my father. 

I too Paumanok, 
I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been wash'd on your shores, 
I too am but a trail of drift and debris, 
I too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island. 

I throw myself upon your breast my father, 
I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me, 
I hold you so firm till you answer me something. 

Kiss me my father, 
Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love, 
Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring I envy. 


                                             4 
Ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,) 
Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother, 
Endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me, 
Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you or gather from you. 

I mean tenderly by you and all, 
I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead, and following me and mine. 

Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses, 
Froth, snowy white, and bubbles, 
(See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last, 
See, the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,) 
Tufts of straw, sands, fragments, 
Buoy'd hither from many moods, one contradicting another, 
From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell, 
Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil, 
Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown, 
A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating, drifted at random, 
Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature, 
Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets, 
We, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out before you, 
You up there walking or sitting, 
Whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet.





Privacy
 

The animals are leaving 
the safety of the trees 

Light sensors respond 
to the footfall of every guest 

To retard the growth of algae 

The fishes must be moved 
from the window 

Stiller than water she lies 
As in a glass dress 

As if all life might come to its end 
within the radius of her bed 

Beyond the reef of trees a beach cannot be seen 
the bay itself barely breathing 

In the other wing of the house 
a small boat awaits elucidation





A Negative of Snow
 

Ice on the puddles, 
in the cups of fallen leaves. 
I'd walk with Dad and a handful 
of other men, the setters working 
the fields, the underbrush. 
It was my job to carry the birds. 
I'd have them all plucked 
by the time we got back to the car. 
On the walk out I'd look 
for puddles I'd missed 
and break them. 

Though many moonless nights 
have fallen on the grave 
like a negative of snow, 
Dad's wheelchair sometimes 
flashes in my mind, and I hear 
the bleating down the hall, 
a voice berating its god, 
his worthless anodynes, 
and the doctors who were 
at that very moment 
increasing his morphine, 
having failed to note 
the word alcoholic on his chart, 
meaning that his damaged liver 
routed the opiates straight 
to his brain, his beautiful fragile brain, 
which I had not yet finished loving. 
My father, who still had manners, 
who was a hardwood, a tough tree. 
That was his first death.





Cinderblock
 

On the first warm day, 
the aides fret about his pate, 
fetch his hat. I push him 
out the automatic doors 
into the pallid sun. 
Dad thinks we should 
stay put until all the Indians 
are back in their tepees, 
but right now he's off to teach 
a Latin class. Where are his keys? 
They're a few miles away, 
in the past, where he's no longer 
active in the community. 
I steer him along the asphalt paths 
of the grounds: bark mulch, 
first green shoots, 
puddle of coffee by a car. 
I loop around so he can discover 
the pile of construction materials twice, 
the word cinderblock coming to him 
more quickly the second time.





Tech Help
 

My bonsai teacher says to quit doing it like a girl. 
I'm pruning the root-ball of a Podocarpus, 
or Buddhist pine, trained semicascade. 

The first time Dad fell, 
the femur broke in eleven places 
due to his artificial knee (titanium and steel). 
A rod screwed to the bones in thirteen places 
didn't work, and the graft stayed weak. 
For two years he fought his wheelchair 
into near submission. The grand finale 
was him riding it down two flights of stairs 
without tipping over or falling out. 
The nurses loved him. 

The last time I called tech help 
I got George in Salt Lake, at work 
at six in the morning their time. 
He was very helpful. 
I offered to write a note for his file, 
but he said, It's OK, Chase. 
Your compliment is enough.





Dream in Which I Love a Third Baseman
 

At first he seemed a child, 
dirt on his lip and the sun 
lighting up his hair behind him. 

All around us, the hesitation 
of year-rounders who know 
the warmer air will bring crowds. 

No one goes to their therapist 
to talk about how happy they are, 
but soon I'd be back in the dugout 

telling my batting coach how 
the view outside my igloo seemed 
to be changing, as if the night 

sky were all the light there is. 
Now, like two babies reaching 
through the watery air to touch soft 

fingers to soft forehead, like blind fish 
sensing a familiar fluttering in the waves, 
slowly, by instinct, we became aware. 

Off-field, outside the park, beyond 
the gates, something was burning.   
The smell was everywhere.





Another Story with a Burning Barn in It
 

I was on the porch pinching back the lobelia 
like trimming a great blue head of hair. 

We'd just planted the near field, the far one 
the day before. I'd never seen it so clear, 

so gusty, so overcast, so clear, so calm. 
They say pearls must be worn or they lose their luster, 

and that morning I happened to remember, 
so I put them on for milking, finding some 

sympathy, I guess, between the two. 
Usually I don't sit down until much later in the day. 

The lobelia was curling in the sun. One by one 
birds flew off, and that should have been a sign. 

Trust is made and broken. I hardly sit down 
at all. It was the time of year for luna moths, 

but we hadn't had any yet settling on the porch 
or hovering above the garden I'd let the wild rose take.





The Hypnotist's Daughter
 

At the London Zoo a toddler falls over the rail 
of the Primate World only if you close your eyes 

and a female gorilla comes to sit by, to circle 
her long dark arm around him only this one time 

while the others stay away. The zookeeper says 
she lost a baby earlier this year only just barely 

and they've been waiting months for her tits to dry. 
The boy's mother watches from above 

only when I say so the thirty minutes it takes 
the right person to lower the right ladder down 

only as a last resort. In the interim a newscaster 
whose station carries it live only if you promise 

not to let go reports that dolphins and sometimes 
certain whales rescue people stranded at sea 

only when I close my eyes lift them to the air 
when they need breathing or swim them close enough 

to land. In the interim I imagine the span of time 
from when the smooth hard snout finds me 

and begins to push only if you promise not to tell 
to when we come into view of a shore only this once 

any shore. In the interim I pray for what should come 
to come. I pray for the cat to come out from under 

the floorboards  only every once in a while to come 
down from the tall maple, to come back alive 

only if you say so in one piece, still in her collar. 
I pray to be saved, to be sent far away, to be 

allowed to just stay home only another month or two 
just stay home and erase the objects in each room 

with my mind while holding them in my hands 
only a matter of time now. I do want to hold them 

in my hands, to hold them to my lungs by way 
of deep breath only since July and a deeper sense 

of inhalation. I pray for you only just this once 
to press out from the small veins at the back of my eyes 

only you back out into the world. I pray for you 
to come and sit by me only a few more minutes now.





That Magnificent Part the Chorus Does about Tragedy
 

There is a theory of crying that tears are the body's way of 
releasing excess elements from the brain. There is a theory of 
dreaming that each one serves to mend something torn, like 
cells of new skin lining up to cover a hole. I'm not one to have 
dreams about flying, but last week we were thirty feet above the 
bay--this was where we went to discuss things, so that no matter 
what we decided it was only we two out there, and we'd have 
to fly back together. I'm not one to have dreams where animals 
can speak, but last night a weeping mare I'd been told to bridle 
wanted me to save her. We discussed what was left of her ability 
to take children for rides--how much trot, how much canter-- 
but I wasn't sure I could do it, having already bridled her and 
all. I was once very brave. Once I was very brave. I was very 
brave once. I boarded a plane before dawn. I carried all those 
heavy bags. I stayed up the whole night before folding the house 
into duffel bags. I took a curl from the base of your skull and 
opened the door to the rusty orange wagon and weighed those 
heavy duffel bags and smiles at the airport official. I boarded 
a tiny propeller plane and from a tiny window I watched you walk 
back to the rusty orange station wagon. They say the whole world 
is warming by imperceptible degrees. I watched the rusty orange 
wagon go whizzing by.





Her Name is Rose
 

With a boil the size of an egg 
protruding from her right hip, 
she knows what I must do, 
and to stall me has locked herself 
inside the bathroom, bargaining 
for a way out. 

But it's too late: I've seen 
the oozing wounds stopped up with bits 
of toilet paper and tape, the scarified 
pockets that crater the surface 
of her arms, buttocks, thighs. 

A mean fix torched her last vein 
years ago, and she's been banging the dope 
ever since, puncturing her body 
like a juju doll. She wants to kick, 
but not now. 

I'm not gonna lie to you, she says 
in a velvet voice. I already know what she's after: 
something stronger than local, a few Percocet, a shot of Demerol 
before she'll let me begin. 

All I can tell you is, when the abscess finally drains 
the odor is so foul it's evil. 

And I'm not sure, driving home 
later that night, still smelling the pallid citrus, 
whether it's merely hallucination, the way 
her memory inhabits me; or if being 
in that same room, inhaling 
that same air, made some of her 
part of me. 

                  And whose veins 
are these, beginning to twitch?





The Sea Chews Things Up
 

When I woke, the waves had gone black, 
turning over the macerated 
curd of the ocean bottom, heaving its sludge 
onto the beach. Some storm far out, I thought, 
had ravaged the sea, stirred up its bed, 
sent the whole mess flying to shore. 
At my feet I found a grave of starfish, 
broken and gnarled among the fleshy 
snipes and heads. Every shade of death 
covered the sand. It looked hopeless 
in the pale day but for the birds, 
a congress of gulls, terns, and the rarest plovers, 
calm for once, satiated, a measure of 
the one law: this sea will claim it all-- 
feed them, catch them, grind their complicated bones.





Cane
 

When the mule balked, he hit him 
sometimes with the flat of a hand 
upside the head; more often 
the stick he carried did its angry trick. 
The mule's job was to power the press, 
iron on iron that wrung the sugar 
out of cane, circling under the coarse 
beam attached to his shoulders and neck. 
That mule of my childhood 
was black, remained blackly obedient 
as round and round he made himself 
the splintered hand of a clock, the groan 
and squeak of machinery chewing 
the reedy stalks to pulp, each second 
delivering another sweet thin drop 
into the black pot at the center. 

He hit him with a rag, old headrag, 
but the animal winced only with the thrash 
of a cane stalk itself--he squinted 
under the rule of that bamboo. 
The sun was another caning 
on his black-hot flesh. He was slow 
as the blackstrap syrup the boiled sugar made, 
so true to the circle he dragged 
we hardly saw him. We loved the rustling 
house of green cane, blind in that field 
of tropical grasses whose white plumes 
announced the long season's wait. 
We yearned for the six-foot stem, the eventual 
six pieces the machete sliced 
at the joints, then the woody exterior 
peeled back lengthwise with a blade. 
It was a black hand we waited for, his job 
to lay bare the grainy fiber we chewed. 
That juice on our tongues 
was his sweetness at work. 
Chester was his name, he kept the mule.





Soul
 

It is not the angel riding a goat, 
trying to make him go. It does no work 
with refusal or guilt, which loves 
only its contorted self. But fancies instead 
my terrier's long pink tongue, 
how it teases out the bone's marrow, 
tasting with all its muscle. 

The angel is silver, but so is the goat 
and the box on which they perch, 
a Victorian gesture in the mansion 
where I spent the fall. They have followed 
me home, their permanent shine presuming, 
while around me, everything withered, 
slowly froze, and began its turn 
toward white. The snow 
is nothing but a great emptiness, 
and I'm tired of trying to find a secret there. 
But look--one leaf 
skittering across the glazed surface 
catches its stem to stand upright, 
the shape of a hand waving.





The Indoors is Endless
 

It's spring in 1827, Beethoven 
hoists his death-mask and sails off. 

The grindstones are turning in Europe's windmills. 
The wild geese are flying northwards. 

Here is the north, here is Stockholm 
swimming palaces and hovels. 

The logs in the royal fireplace 
collapse from Attention to At Ease. 

Peace prevails, vaccine and potatoes, 
but the city wells breathe heavily. 

Privy barrels in sedan chairs like paschas 
are carried by night over the North Bridge. 

The cobblestones make them stagger 
mamselles loafers gentlemen. 

Implacably still, the sign-board 
with the smoking blackamoor. 

So many islands, so much rowing 
with invisible oars against the current! 

The channels open up, April May 
and sweet honey dribbling June. 

The heat reaches islands far out. 
The village doors are open, except one. 

The snake-clock's pointer licks the silence. 
The rock slopes glow with geology's patience. 

It happened like this, or almost. 
It is an obscure family tale 

about Erik, done down by a curse 
disabled by a bullet through the soul. 

He went to town, met an enemy 
and sailed home sick and grey. 

Keeps to his bed all that summer. 
The tools on the wall are in mourning. 

He lies awake, hears the woolly flutter 
of night moths, his moonlight comrades. 

His strength ebbs out, he pushes in vain 
against the iron-bound tomorrow. 

And the God of the depths cries out of the depths 
Deliver me! Deliver yourself!' 

All the surface action turns inwards. 
He's taken apart, put together. 

The wind rises and the wild rose bushes 
catch on the fleeing light. 

The future opens, he looks into 
the self-rotating kaleidoscope 

sees indistinct fluttering faces 
family faces not yet born. 

By mistake his gaze strikes me 
as I walk around here in Washington 

among grandiose houses where only   
every second column bears weight. 

White buildings in crematorium style 
where the dream of the poor turns to ash. 

The gentle downward slope gets steeper 
and imperceptibly becomes an abyss.





National Insecurity
 

The Under Secretary leans forward and draws an X 
and her ear-drops dangle like swords of Damocles. 

As a mottled butterfly is invisible against the ground 
so the demon merges with the opened newspaper. 

A helmet worn by no one has taken power. 
The mother-turtle flees flying under the water.





November in the Former DDR
 

The almighty cyclop's-eye clouded over 
and the grass shook itself in the coal dust. 

Beaten black and blue by the night's dreams 
we board the train 
that stops at every station 
and lays eggs. 

Almost silent. 
The clang of the church bells' buckets 
fetching water. 
And someone's inexorable cough 
scolding everything and everyone. 

A stone idol moves its lips: 
it's the city. 
Ruled by iron-hard misunderstandings 
among kiosk attendants butchers 
metal-workers naval officers 
iron-hard misunderstandings, academics! 

How sore my eyes are! 
They've been reading by the faint glimmer of the glow-worm   lamps. 

November offers caramels of granite. 
Unpredictable! 
Like world history 
laughing at the wrong place. 

But we hear the clang 
of the church bells' buckets fetching water 
every Wednesday 
- is it Wednesday? - 
so much for our Sundays!





The Sea Shell
 

I have hidden inside a sea shell 
but forgotten in which. 

Now daily I dive, 
filtering the sea through my fingers, 
to find myself. 
Sometimes I think 
a giant fish has swallowed me. 
Looking for it everywhere I want to make sure 
it will get me completely. 

The sea-bed attracts me, and 
I'm repelled by millions 
of sea shells that all look alike. 
Help, I am one of them. 
If only I knew, which. 

How often I've gone straight up 
to one of them, saying: That's me. 
Only, when I prised it open 
it was empty.





Perpetuum Mobile
 

Between people's 
ideals 
and their realization 
there is always 
a greater drop 
than in the highest 
of waterfalls. 

This potential gradient 
can be exploited 
rationally, 
if we build a sort of 
power station above it. 

The energy it supplies, 
even if we use it only 
to light our cigarettes, 
is something 
anyway; 
for while one is smoking 
one can very seriously 
think up 
ideals even crazier.





To the Sea
 

I go again to the sea and converse with Ovid 
whose verses like the Romanian coast roll along 
so wide and subdued: waves that wait for the ice to break. 

My poet, you that make what I sing to thousand years old, 
ancient boundary stone on the edge of the Romanian language, 
you the gulls have elected on to the governing board of our 
                                                                              epics, 
of our song-grief you turned into Latin and gave 
to the wind to carry to Rome and there, chiselled 
into the column, await the Dacian prisoners. 
You the first whom nostalgia, our dor, ate up 
in those fields where the dust is sweet. You the first 
to put your trust like a child in poetry's spellbinding power 
and in help from abroad. 
Sooner the Emperor would have sent experts to you at Tomi, 
to change the climate, than see you back home, 
your airy fame back in the purple of his retainers. 
Who, he has said himself, could be better suited 
to stand on the shore of the Pontus Euxinus, observing 
how gradually it becomes the Black Sea, than a poet, 
a good one, and one of repute--whom shall we send then, 
                                                                           whom? 
And the choice fell on you, Ovid. 
You were the first to occur to him because you 
had just begun to be known, appreciated and talked about 
like a bitter-sweet herb--that was your predicament. 
Augustus liked your elegies, but only from a distance, 
where they had the remedial effect the physicians prescribed, 
an agreeable melancholy, after meals especially, when they 
                                                               repeated on him... 
The elegies were a medicine prescribed by the physicians 
                                                            to save the Empire. 
He even said: Why hasn't that boy sent us anything lately? 
Force him to work, pinch him a bit, so that he'll grow 
sad and Pontic, this wind is troubling me again, I'm gulping air...' 
People are asking why you had to relegate him,' a senator 
                                                            timidly interjected. 
Suggest to them that he subverted the Empire,' the Emperor 
                                                               cynically smiled. 
Morally or materially?'--the exalted servant seemed hard 
                                                                        of hearing. 
What, are you trying to drive me into a quandary? Both, let's 
                                                               say, a bit of each. 
Ovid has done immense material and moral harm 
to Latinity, and the citizens are indignant. 
Or perhaps,' he considered, moral would be better, 
after all we are an Imperium and don't stint the expenses 
of a poet, but in moral matters we're strict: so, he corrupted 
                                                                      our youth.' 
Next day Augustus had second thoughts: 
No, for the time being no explanations, for anyone, 
till we've thought of something more plausible'; and, to 
                                                             change the subject, 
What's Horace doing?' It's taken   hold of him too, he's writing 
no more odes but only epodes, nothing but epodes, an obscure 
                                                                  sort of gibberish, 
what shall we do about Horace, will he too become a case?' 
Let him be, let him be. Let's wait and see how he develops, 
                                                         he may have talent. 
Maecenas and his house, after all, will take care of the cost 
and we shall send him the bill with a troop of a hundred men. 
But as for Ovid, he shall stay for a while yet 
at Tomi, and no one shall hurt a hair of his head. We shall 
think it over, mediate, consult the augurs too. 
No precipitous measures, where poets are concerned.' 

Two thousand years have passed, and the Emperor 
has not hit on appropriate action, he's thinking still. 
But you must not give up hope, Ovid, you will be pardoned. 
The matter was only provisional, an emergency, so be patient, 
the problem will be resolved, as I said, when circumstances 
                                                                           permit. 

I go again to the sea and converse with Ovid, 
the poet whose lines of fortune and arteries my earth senses 
when he raises the Dobruja's broad hand to his brow.





Sorry
 

When I hurt you and cast you off, that was buccaneer work: 
the sky must have turned on the Bay that day and spat. 
We'd tarried on corners, we'd dallied on sofas, we were 
in progress, do you see? Yet stormcloud bruises bloomed 

where once we touched. The walls swam under minty fever; 
we failed to reach the long, low sleep of conquerors. 
Since I played wrong and you did too, since we were wrong, 
we need apologies; for your part in this sorry slip of hearts, 

you should walk on Golden Hill at night alone; for mine 
I will hang with my enemies, out on the long shore, 
our brigand bodies impaled on the horns of our failures, 
the cold day casting draughts through our brinkled bones.





Lumsden Hotel
 

The kilted porter shook my hand in welcome, 
drained it of blood and gave me back my luggage. 
I signed the register in my own name 
for the first time in my life of low celebrity. 
In the lounge bar, there were pictures by Margarita 
but no sign of margaritas by the pitcher. 
All night, the couple in the next-door room 
failed noisily to make love even once. 
The signature tune of the air conditioning 
was a surface B-side for any one-hit-wonder. 
Weary, I ordered up the late night menu 
from room service, but sleep wasn't on it 
so, after an hour of mentally undressing myself, 
I donned the pyjamas with the killer bee motif 
and there on the bed I wrote a dozen 
identical postcards to friends I'd forgotten. 
No doubt to keep the cold tap company, 
the hot tap had opted to be a cold tap too. 
Funnel-web spiders wove their lazy way 
toward each other across the scarlet ceiling 
and when I solved the riddle of the shower, 
no blood came gushing, but no water either. 
By the bed, a Gideon Bible in Esperanto 
and a phone-book listing Lumsdens of the world; 
in the mini-bar, flat Vimto and a half-pint 
of someone else's mother's milk, turned to fur. 
The TV had one channel, showing highlights 
from my worst performances in every sphere. 
At three, in the courtyard, a chambermaid choir 
sang a barbershop version of I Will Survive'. 
The only time I dared to close my eyes, 
dervishes under the bed began to talk dirty. 
When I left at nine and settled my check, 
they told me clearly Don't come back.





Then
 

For the first time, I listen to a lost 
and secret recording of us 
making love near-on ten years ago. 

I recognize your voice, your sounds, 
though if I knew no better, 
I could be any man in any room. 

After, the rising sounds of rising 
and of dressing and once 
as you step up close to the deck, 

perhaps to pick up shoes, you sing 
the chorus of Sunday Morning. 
I call on you to hurry and we leave. 

It does not end then; the tape rolls on. 
A few late cars which sigh by 
might have passed us walking away 

triumphant, unaware we've left behind 
this mop and mow mechanism 
of silence to which we may never return.





Solo
 

For once, I felt wanted, dead or alive, 
the day my fame outgrew the Famous Five. 

There came a time I could give no more 
to the other guys in the Gang of Four 

and I felt the dead weight fall from me 
when I unyoked the clowns of the Crucial Three. 

I considered all this as I boarded the bus 
to quit the town not big enough for both of us. 

One eye didn't seem so much to leave behind 
as I sped to my job in the kingdom of the blind.





My Pain
 

...one begins, ungratefully, to long for the contrasting tone of some honest, unironic misery, confident that when it arrives Roddy Lumsden will have the technical resources to handle it.  Neil Powell, TLS
I'm trying to string together three words 
which I hate more than I hate myself: 
gobsmacked, hubby and...when I realise 
that words no longer count for much at all. 

And that's me back down, head on the floor. 
It's like Cathal Coughlan goes in his song: 

till I've seen how low I can go. 

It's like what my ancestor told me in a dream: 
You'll be a sponge for the pain of others. 
It's like what I told the lassie from the local paper: 
I do not suffer for my art, I just suffer. 

And face it, while we're at it, it's like 
what curly Shona said that night at Graffiti 
when all the gang were gathered for the show: 
how she reckoned I would be the first to die, 

or the time I slipped back from the bogs in Bo's 
to hear my best friend tell a stranger girl 
who'd been sweet in my company, mind how you go 
with Roddy, he's damaged goods, you know.





My Limbo
 

It doesn't take the full-wind sickness, 
just the mere, the constant threat of it, 
just the salt trace, its faint knocking 
to bring the spirits of chance and chaos 
into this house - they stand in doorways: 
quaint, foul allies, swivelling their ghost hips, 
tugging at their gowns of transparency 
and mischief. They buzz me with lust, 
and I'm undone. 
                        Remember these: the Cupid 
who ducked up from behind a wall and aimed 
an arrow, one evening on Broughton Street; 
whatever grabbed my shoulder at Earlshall; 
a sound of heavy boxes pushed up and down 
the empty hallway; the past is the self's ghoul. 
What is it, Roddy, you know you've blocked out? 
What left your brain so empty that it gushed full 
with circus music and the safe bet of trivia? 
Here I am swinging on the fence of fences, in limbo, 
where the other world loves to try my pragmatism 
and it's I who have invited them, summoned 
by this self-indulgent ouija. 
                                        But what is it 
that folds my clothes as I sleep and leaves them 
on the edge of the bed? Who hides my slippers, 
re-hangs the paintings? Deja vu. Did a minor 
goddess filch me in Manila and follow me home, 
prone, as they are, to easy-led mortal men. 
And I'm easy, easy. So, come now, teach me 
to believe in the soul. Hurt me with the truth. Press 
me back down on this cheap, wine-coloured carpet; 
let me know for once and for all how fucked I am.





Against Naturism
 

I realise it's not all salad sandwiches 
at pinewood picnics, endless volleyball. 
I've heard the argument that talk of shame 
and how our forebears thought their bodies dirty; 
how we've all got one. Seen one, seen 'em all. 

But it's not for me, beneath my double load 
of Calvinist and voyeuristic tendencies. 
For me, I have to see the clothes come off: 
the way a button's thumbed through cotton cloth - 
a winning move in some exotic game 

with no set rules but countless permutations - 
or how a summer dress falls to the floor 
with momentary mass and with a plash 
that stirs us briefly as we ply our passion; 
a hand pushed through the coldness of a zip, 

three fingertips that follow down the spine 
to where a clasp is neatly spun undone 
amidkiss, by prime legerdemain 
and who cares that it happens once in four 
and never, never on the first undressing, 

it must be better than a foreskin snagged 
on gorse thorns or a cold, fat nipple jammed 
in the scissor drawer, the bounty and the blessing, 
the mystery of nakedness reduced 
till on a par with go-go palaces 

where goosebumped, grinding strippers strut their stuff 
in the birthday clothes of backstreet empresses, 
down on a par with the oncologist 
who gropes for lumps, the night-morgue man who clips 
his nails amongst the naked, bin-bagged stiffs. 

So, stranger, what I want to say is this: 
if you're to join me in a little sinning 
(and this is my place up here on the right), 
please understand I'd value some reluctance, 
a cold-feet shiver, as in the beginning 

when Eve discovered modesty and slipped 
in and out of something comfortable. 
For there are many ways to skin a cat, 
but ours is human nature - things come off 
so rarely. Come in. Let me take your coat.





The Man I Could Have Been
 

The man I could have been works for a vital institution, is a vital 
            institution. 
Without him, walls will crumble, somewhere, paint will peel. 
He takes a catch. 
He is outdoorsy and says It was a nightmare and means the traffic. 
He's happy to watch a film and stops short of living in one. 

The man I could have been owns a Subaru pickup the colour of   
            cherry tomatoes. 
He's in the black, not in the dark. 
His mother is calm. 
Women keep his baby picture in the windownooks of wallets. 
No one dies on him. 

The man I could have been owns bits of clothes not worn by   
            uncles first. 
He has no need of medicine. 
He walks from Powderhall to Newington in twenty minutes. 
He plays the piano a little. 
Without him, havens buckle, sickbeds bloom. 

The man I could have been lives locally. 
He is quietly algebraic. 
Without him, granite will not glister. 
And when he sees a crisis, he does not dive in feet first. 
He votes, for he believes in their democracy. 

The man I could have been has a sense of direction. 
For him, it was never Miss Scarlet with the dagger in the kitchen. 
He knows his tilth and sows his seed. 
He'll make a father. 
He is no maven nor a connoisseur. 

The man I could have been has a season ticket at Tynecastle. 
He comes in at night and puts on The Best of U2 
He browses. 
He puts fancy stuff in his bathwater. 
He doesn't lace up his life with secrets. 

The man I could have been was born on a high horse. 
He knows the story of the Willow Pattern. 
He had a dream last night you'd want to hear about 
and remembers the words to songs. 
His back is a saddle where lovers have ridden. 

The man I could have been has a sovereign speech in him he's   
            yet to give. 
He might well wrassle him a bear. 
He is a man about town. 
He has the exact fare on him. 
Without him, motley trauma. 

The man I could have been, he learns from my mistakes. 
He never thought it would be you. 
And no one says he's looking rather biblical. 
He has no need of London 
and walks the middle of the road for it is his. 

The man I could have been is quick and clean. 
He is no smalltown Jesus nor a sawdust Cesear. 
Without him, salt water would enter your lungs. 
He doesn't hear these endless xylophones. 
That's not him lying over there.





Infighting
 

Take this: for nothing here's chiming, vibrating 
and all this vainglory and self-deprecating 
just goads at the tender parts, gets irritating. 

You'll make no advance advocating monopoly 
on any vocabulary; even cacophony 
needs the needle to make its point properly. 

It's true that you find yourself fey and bewitching, 
yet always you feel that the itch that you're scratching's 
soothed better by far by bravadoes of bitching. 

The off-pat flyting, back-biting and threnody 
you render and throw up, at will, won't remedy 
the rot of your serenading, lute-laden wannabe. 

You can't see a barrier without pushing through it; 
it's a poor pearl of pathos you don't disintuit 
and you now give a doing when once you'd just do it. 

You want my advice? Here it is: try removing 
the self from your argument - gluts of self-loving 
just pudding the gut of whatever you're proving. 

That's it on the chin and I'm sure you can take it, 
but that shadow you're boxing is me, so please break it 
gently. Best wishes, I hope that you make it.





Brief reflection on accuracy
 

Fish 
    always accurately know where to move and when, 
    and likewise 
    birds have an accurate built-in time sense 
    and orientation. 

Humanity, however, 
    lacking such instincts resorts to scientific 
    research. Its nature is illustrated by the following 
    occurrence. 

A certain soldier 
    had to fire a cannon at six o'clock sharp every evening. 
    Being a soldier he did so. When his accuracy was 
    investigated he explained: 

I go by 
    the absolutely accurate chronometer in the window 
    of the clockmaker down in the city. Every day at seventeen 
    forty-five I set my watch by it and 
    climb the hill where my cannon stands ready. 
    At seventeen fifty-nine precisely I step up to the cannon 
    and at eighteen hours sharp I fire. 

And it was clear 
    that this method of firing was absolutely accurate. 
    All that was left was to check that chronometer. So 
    the clockmaker down in the city was questioned about 
    his instrument's accuracy. 

Oh, said the clockmaker, 
    this is one of the most accurate instruments ever. Just imagine, 
    for many years now a cannon has been fired at six o'clock sharp. 
    And every day I look at this chronometer 
    and always it shows exactly six. 

Chronometers tick and cannon boom.





Brief reflection on an old woman with a barrow
 

Given an old woman and given a barrow. 
I.e. the system old woman O and barrow B. 

The system is moving from the paved yard Y to the corner C, 
    from the corner C to the Stone S, from the stone S 
    to the forest F, from the forest F to the horizon H. 

The horizon H is the point where vision ends 
    and memory begins. 

Nevertheless the system is moving 
    at a constant velocity v, 
    along a constant path, 
    through a constant destiny, 
renewing its impulse and its meaning 
    from within itself. 

A relatively independent system: 
in landscapes from horizon to horizon 
always just one old woman with a barrow. 

And thus we have, once and for all, 
    that geodetic unit, the 
    unit of travel there and back, the 
    unit of autumn, the 
    unit Our daily bread, the 
    unit of wind and lowering sky, the 
    unit of the distance home, the 
    unit As we forgive them, the 
    unit of nightfall, the 
    unit of footsteps and dust, the 
    unit of life-fulfillment Amen.





Holy Shit
 

It used to be more private--just the 
immediate family gathered after mass, 
the baptismal font at the rear 
of the church tiny as a bird bath. 
The priest would ladle a few teaspoons' 
tepid holy water on the bundled baby's 
forehead, make a crack about the halo 
being too tight as the new soul wailed. 
We'd go home to pancakes and eggs. 

These days it's a big Holy-wood production-- 
midmass, the giant altar rolls back to reveal 
a Jacuzzi tub surrounded by potted palms. 
The priest hikes up his chasuble, steps 
barefoot out of his black leather loafers 
and wades in like a newfangled John as 
organ music swells and the baby-bearing families 
line up like jumbo jets ready for takeoff. 

But when the godparents handed my niece's newborn 
naked to their parish priest, and he dunked her 
into the Jacuzzi's bath-warm holy water, 
her little one grew so calm and blissful she 
pooped--not a smelly three-days' worth, explosive 
diaper load, but enough to notice. As the godparents 
scooped the turds with a handkerchief, 
the savvy priest pretended he hadn't seen, 
swept through the fouled water with his palm 
before the next baby in line was submerged. 

After mass, my niece sat speechless, 
red-faced, not knowing what to say-- 
or whether--as church ladies, friends, and 
family members presented one by one to 
the tub where the babies had been 
baptized. As they knelt and bowed 
and dipped their fingers in, 
and blessed themselves.





Brief reflection on killing the Christmas carp
 

You take a kitchen-mallet 
and a knife 
and hit 
the right spot, so it doesn't jerk, for 
jerking means only complications and reduces profit. 

And the watchers already narrow their eyes, already admire the   
            dexterity, 
already reach for their purses. And paper is ready 
for wrapping it up. And smoke rises from chimneys. 
And Christmas peers from windows, creeps along the ground 
and splashes in barrels. 

Such is the law of happiness. 

I am just wondering if the carp is the right creature. 

A far better creature surely would be one 
which--stretched out--held flat--pinned down-- 
would turn its blue eye 
on the mallet, the knife, the purse, the paper, 
the watchers and the chimneys 
and Christmas, 

And quickly 

say something. For instance 

These are my happiest days; these are my golden days. 
Or 
The starry sky above me and the moral law within me, 
Or   
And yet it moves. 

Or at least 
Hallelujah!





Perfect Pitch
 

"F. . . the oven is an F"  Samantha Foggle, age 3
Oh, to hear the world with such clarity. 
Such surety. To know the note 
of your breakfast chat is B-flat minor. 
That the '57 Chevy stalled outside the 
garage is a D. To recognize the Apricot 
kitchen paint for what it is: F-sharp. 
To understand the way you feel for him is G, 
definitely a G. And as you watch him 
descend the scale of the front steps to his car 
for work, the house quiets to an A. 
The arpeggio of last night's Every 
Good Boy Deserves Favor 
still ringing in your ears.





Dreams
 

They sap man's substance 
as moon the dew. 
A rope grows erect 
from the crown of the head. 
A black swan hatches 
from a pebble. 
And a flock of angels in the sky 
is taking an evening class 
on the skid pan. 

I dream, so I dream. 
I dream 
that three times three is nine, 
that the right-hand 
rule applies; 
and when the circus leaves 
the trampled ground will 
once more overgrow with grass. 

Yes, grass. 
Unequivocal grass. 
Just grass.





Napoleon
 

Children, when was 
Napoleon Bonaparte born, 
asks teacher. 

A thousand years ago, the children say. 
A hundred years ago, the children say. 
Last year, the children say. 
No one knows. 

Children, what did 
Napoleon Bonaparte do, 
asks teacher. 

Won a war, the children say. 
Lost a war, the children say. 
No one knows. 

Our butcher had a dog 
called Napoleon, 
says Frantisek. 
The butcher used to beat him and the dog died 
of hunger 
a year ago. 

And all the children are now sorry 
for Napoleon.





Wings
 

We have a microsopic anatomy of the whale this gives Man assurance William Carlos Williams
We have   
a map of the universe 
for microbes, 
we have 
a map of a microbe 
for the universe. 

we have 
a Grand Master of chess 
made of electronic circuits. 

But above all 
we have 
the ability 
to sort peas, 
to cup water in our hands, 
to seek 
the right screw 
under the sofa 
for hours 

This   
gives us 
wings.





Whats Written on the Body
 

He will not light long enough 
for the interpreter to gather 
the tatters of his speech. 
But the longer we listen 
the calmer he becomes. 
He shows me the place where his daughter 
has rubbed with a coin, violaceous streaks 
raising a skeletal pattern on his chest. 
He thinks he's been hit by the wind. 
He's worried it will become pneumonia. 
In Cambodia, he'd be given 
a special tea, a prescriptive sacrifice, 
the right chants to say. But I 
know nothing of Chi, of Karma, 
and ask him to lift the back of his shirt, 
so I may listen to his breathing. 
Holding the stethoscope's bell I'm stunned 
by the whirl of icons and script 
tattooed across his back, their teal green color 
the outline of a map which looks 
like Cambodia, perhaps his village, a lake, 
then a scroll of letters in a watery signature. 
I ask the interpreter what it means. 
It's a spell, asking his ancestors 
to protect him from evil spirits-- 
she is tracing the lines with her fingers-- 
and those who meet him for kindness. 
The old man waves his arms and a staccato 
of diphthongs and nasals fills the room. 
He believes these words will lead his spirit 
back to Cambodia after he dies. 
I see, I say, and rest my hand on his shoulder. 
He takes full deep breaths and I listen, 
touching down with the stethoscope 
from his back to his front. He watches me 
with anticipation--as if awaiting a verdict. 
His lungs are clear. You'll be fine, 
I tell him. It's not your time to die. 
His shoulders relax and he folds his hands 
above his head as if in blessing. 
Ar-kon, he says. All better now.





The end of the world
 

The bird had come to the very end of its song 
and the tree was dissolving under its claws. 

And in the sky the clouds were twisting 
and darkness flowed through all the cracks 
into the sinking vessel of the landscape. 

Only in the telegraph wires 
a message still 
crackled: 

C-.-o---m--e. h...o---m--e. 
y-.--o---u..- h...a.-v...-e. 
a.-s...o---n-.

Collision
 

To think I might have been dead, 
he said to himself, ashamed, as if this were 
a curse of the heart, raising a bundle of bones 
to a man's height. As if it were suddenly 
forbidden to touch even words that had dropped to the ground. 
Besides, he was afraid of finding 
his body in a metal press. Embarrassing 
down to the capillaries. 

the tram stood jammed above him 
like an icebreaker's prow and all that was left of the car 
was a grotesque pretzel with a chunk bitten off 
by the dentures of a demented angel. 
Something dark was dripping on the rails, 
and a strikingly pale wind was leafing 
through a book still warm. 

People were forming a circle and with deaf-mute 
sympathy awaited the play's catharsis, 
like maggots emerging from 
under the wings of a beheaded chicken. 
From afar came the approaching wail of sirens, 
congealing in the jinxed air-conditioning of that day 
and that minute. Dewdrops were falling 
on the back of the neck like remnants of 
atmospheric dignity. Embarrassing down to the capillaries. 

No, thank you, he said, I'll wait; 
for a silent film had started to run 
without subtitles, without colour and without answers. 

       And what about the magnetic monopoles 
escaping seconds after the Big Bang, 
protons violating the irreversibility of the flow of time? 

       What about the giant molecular clouds 
under the galaxy's shoulders, conceiving 
the embryos of stars? 

    What about the loneliness of the first genes 
accumulating amino acids in shallow primeval pools 
at the expense of entropic usurers? 

      What about the desiccated starfish 
like proto-eagles' talons dug into the bed 
of a vanishing sea? 

       What about the mortal migrations of birds 
observing the sun's inclination 
and the roar of sex hormones? 

       What about the caged half-crazed 
orang-utan who vomits because 
he has nothing else to do? 

       What about the mice which for a thousand years 
have learned to sing and the frogs balancing 
on one leg like the thigh 
of a beauty queen from Mesopotamia? 

       What about poetry, an enterprise 
so disorderly it twists the rulers 
and increases the squint of school inspectors? 

       And what about the little girl 
in the leukemia ward who, on the toilet, 
tried to show what kind of moustache the kind doctor has, 
but as her skinny sticks of hands let go of 
the edge of the bowl, she falls in and so 
tried again and again? 

       And what about the weak-kneed intellectual, 
the professor who understood the approximate universe 
but forgot the traffic rules? 

No, thank you, he said to some uniform, 
I don't need anything. My papers are in my pocket 
but I can't reach there. And he tried 
to smile a little at this embarrassment of complicated creation. 
It's all my fault, he said, 
thank you. 
                And then he died.





Interferon
 

Always just one demon in the attic. 
Always just one death in the village. And the dogs 
howling in that direction. And from the other end 
the new-born child arrives, the only one 
to fill the empty space in that wide air. 

Likewise also cells infected by a virus 
send out a signal all around them and defences 
are mobilised so that no other virus 
has any hope just then of taking root 
or changing fate. This phenomenon 
is known as interference. 

And when a poet dies in the depth of night 
a single black bird wakens in the thicket 
and sings for all it is worth 
while from the sky a black rain trickles down 
like sperm or something, 
the song is spattered and the choking bird 
sings sitting on an empty rib-cage 
in which an imaginary heart 
awakes to its forever interfering 
futility. And in the morning the sky is clear, 
the bird is weary and the soil is fertilised. 
The poet is no more. 

In Klatovy Street, in Pilsen, 
by the railway bridge, there was 
a shop with quilted bedcovers. 
In times when there's a greater need 
for a steel cover over our continent 
business in quilted bedcovers 
is slack. The shopkeeper was hard up. 
Practical men when hard up usually 
turn to art. 
In his shopwindow, open to the interior 
of his shop, its owner built 
a gingerbread house of quilts 
and every evening staged 
a performance about a quilted 
gingerbread house and a red-quilted 
Little Red Riding Hood, while his wife 
in this quilted masquerade was alternately 
the wolf or the witch, and he himself 
a padded-out Hansel, 
or Gretel, Red Riding Hood or grandmother. 
The sight of the two old people 
crawling about in swollen billows 
of textiles round the chubby cottage 
was not unambiguous. It was a little like 
the life of sea cucumbers in the mud 
under a reef. Outside thundered 
the approaching surf of war and they 
conducted their quilted 
pantomime outside time and action. 

For a while children would stand outside but 
soon they would go home. Nothing was sold. 
But it was the only pantomime 
at that time. The black bird sang 
and rain poured into a rib-cage 
wearing the Star of David. 

But in the actors under those quilted covers 
l'anima allegra must have just then awoken 
and so, sweating and rapt, they acted 
their undersea commedia dell'arte, 
thinking there was a backstage until 
a scene was finished, jerkily they moved 
from shopwindow to gingerbread house and back, 
with the exuberance of Columbines 
stricken by polio, while the music 
of fifes and drums did not reach them. 

Or else they thought that such a deep 
humiliation of the customary dignity of age 
interfered with the steps of gentlemen 
in leather coats and with 
the departure of trains to human slaughterhouses. 
It did. 

The black bird sang and the ruined 
sclerotic hearts leapt in their breasts, 
and then one morning when they didn't play 
and had not even raised the blind - 
the sky was clear, the soil was fertilised - 
the quilted bedcovers were confiscated 
for the eastern front and the actors 
transferred to the backstage 
of the world, called Bergen-Belsen. 
No trace is left of the shop today: 
it's now a greengrocer's with woody parsnips. 

Always just one death in the village. 
Always just one demon. 
Great is the power of the theatre, even if 
it always does get knocked down in the end 
and flung backstage. 

The dogs howl in that direction. 
And the butterfly pursues the man 
who stole the flowers. 

When we did autopsies at the psychiatric 
hospital in Bohnice, filled with the 
urban exudations of relative futility, 
the car would tip us out amidst the ward blocks 
whose inmates waved from windows 
with some kind of May Day pennants, and then 
one went, hugely alone, 
beyond a spinney to the solitary morgue, where 
the naked bodies of ancient schizophrenics 
awaited us, along with two live inmates; one of them 
would pull the corpses up from underground 
with a rope hoist and place them 
upon the tables as a mother might an infant 
for baptism, while the other was lurking, pen ready poised, 
in a dark corner to write up 
the Latin protocol, and he wrote faultlessly. 
Neither of them uttered the slightest sound, only 
the hoist shaft moaned...and the knife 
drawn over skin and dermis made a sound 
of satin tearing...and they were always 
enormous and unprecedented pneumonias 
and tumours big as dragons' eggs, 
it rained into the open thorax - 
and in that roaring silence one had to 
break the line of an angel's fall 
and dictate the logical verdict 
on a long-sentenced demon... 
and the schizophrenic's pen in the corner 
busily scraped across the paper 
like an eager mouse. 

We need no prompters 
said the puppets haughtily. 

The air of that anatomical theatre 
was filled with interferon, 
it was a great personal demonstration 
against malignant growth, it was 
a general amnesty for the walls, entropy 
was abjured for the moment 

because there are no bubbles at the bottom 
to burst under the breeze. 

The red balloon outside rose up 
to an unsuspected sky, its chains 
strained by the certainty that the nearer the inferno 
the greater the paradise, 
the nearer the prison cell 
the greater the freedom. 
Cantabit vacuus coran latrone viator. 

And that is the weird essence of the theatre 
that an actor stripped of everything mounts to 
the very top of the conflagration 
and everything else dies down, falls silent 
like a long-hunted animal, its muscles 
still twitching but with endorphines 
and an infinite peace in the brain. 

Yes, even a whale will sometimes leave the school, 
hurl itself into shallow water and perish in the sun 
like a levelled cathedral, with pushed-out penis, 
and death is instantly buried 
in a grain of sand 
and the sea laughs. 

Go ask the tree-stumps; in broken language 
they preach about saplings. And in the jargon 
of galactic white dwarfs the stars 
of the main sequence shine forever. 

In the non-Euclidean curved space, 
which eludes understanding as much as 
the interference of the theatre, 
you ceaselessly hear the voices of children 
from the primary school of death, 
children from the puppet tragedies of the kitchen 
and children from the junketings of war, 
when skewering them on lances 
with their wriggling little legs 
provided spice like curry for the mercenaries, 
voices of children eluding understanding - 

But we've washed behind our ears, 
we've stopped pulling the cat's tail, 
we've stopped shoving our fingers 
into electric sockets - 

What else is there left in the universe 
of hominisation, slow as the decay of tritium, 
than the doctrine of the growing sense of shame of demons: 
since Aztec times high priests no longer 
offer up sacrifice while dressed in the skin 
of a freshly flayed prisoner. 

We need no prompters, they said - 

Once on St Nicholas' Day, the man acting the Devil, 
dead drunk, fell down some stairs and lay there, 
and a child, experiencing that embarrassing 
joy mere inches from terror, 
ran out after the thump and called: 

Mummy, come here, there's a dead devil - 

And so he was, even though the actor 
picked himself up after another tot. Maybe the dogs howled, 
but only by a black mistake. 
In the sky shone the stars of the main sequence, 
the bird was getting ready in the thicket, 
the child shivered a little 
from the chill of three million years, 
in that wide air, but 
they prompted him, poetically, 

you're only imagining all this, 
look, the butterfly's already 
bringing the flowers back...and 
there's no other devil left...and 
the nearer paradise... 

He believed, and yet he didn't.





Monaco
 

For Michael Williams
Monaco was clean, with small clean streets. 
There was not much in the way of a shore. 
There was hardly any place to go. 
One clipped, well-behaved London plane tree,   
not welcoming like most ordinary trees, 
was kept apart by a white spear-tipped fence, 
and had a somewhat diffident sense of noblesse oblige. 
Through the cream silk brocade window treatments, 
you could see it; it did not contain birds, 
repelled the idea of nests, its roots 
trained and snipped. At night, it was lit. 
Spritzed, its leaves shimmered like the sequins of a whore. 
In the palace hung a portrait of Princess Grace's family, 
an extravaganza of pastel sfumato by R.W. Cowan, 
blurring every uncertain, authentic thing. 
The air inside the cliffs thickened as in the closet 
of a grandmother. Perfumed Germans winced, 
smooching with strong lips on the embankment. 

When the man and woman arrived at the Htel de Paris, 
the staff assumed they were married. 
The German jet ski instructor was unsure 
and asked: "Are you brother and sister? 
They paused, demurely, and smiled. 
The mystery of their bond made it more intense. 
The man and the woman were in their late thirties 
or early forties; they were not young, nor were they old. 

The woman was French and wore a white linen shirt, 
starched and pressed. She made her money in the drug trade, 
but all the man knew was that she sold works of art: 
a Matisse here, a Picasso there --   
each transaction taking place in the Bahamas. 
She was what she said she was, 
but we are rarely what we say we are. 
The man, a poor American, meant to say no, but instead said yes. 
He was tall, athletic and effeminate with a mincing gate --   
as if he were being chased by something no one could see. 
Dressed in cashmere and shantung, 
he wore needle-pointed shoes by Stubbs & Wootton. 
Broad-shouldered, practical, the Frenchwoman grimaced, 
was referred to as "handsome. 
Ample were her gestures, ample her need to please; 
her tone, although not sexual, came close. 
Her preferences were dubious; maybe everyone's are. 

Nevertheless, the couple exhibited variations 
the world never embraced, but presented as a couple 
the world embraced them promptly, 
for the world trusted what was coupled. 
He was he; she was she; both were naive, 
but naivety has a way of hiding its intentions. 
Whatever their motives happened to be, 
it pleased them to make a myth for everyone to see. 
Promises were skirted at a little cafe --   
"What shall we name our children, mon petit chri? 
she asked. How controlled their wonder was. 

The couple was received for cakes and tea 
by the Baroness von Lindenhoffer. 
The Baroness was lesbian, but of this she never spoke, 
and so she believed herself a conundrum --   
for her, muteness banished the undoable. 
She often began her conversations 
by mentioning her brief marriage to a hairy Russian acrobat. 
Her makeup was heavy, clown-like, 
and over her large, ill-defined body, red polka dots sheeted her parts. 
Despite this, people mistook her for a man. 
On a chintz loveseat, each hip bookended by a pug, 
she sat and said: "You seem like a lovely couple! 
She meant what she said but she didn't say what she meant. 

Then there was talk of places they had traveled 
and feelings of superiority 
at having seen what others had not: 
"Oh, you haven't been there? and "Oh, you must go! 
Through the large picture window, 
beyond the Baroness's head, piled high with hair dyed red, 
slowly processed gargantuan cruise ships 
like wedding cakes with glittering tiers of candles. 
She inserted another biscotti behind her lips 
which were the size of luggage handles, winked and said:   
"Here in Monaco our favorite word is more! 
Her eyes scanned the clutter of the Cte d'Azur: 
the sea published its gilded mirrors, 
the sun accelerated beauty and its loss, 
no children for miles and Brigitte Bardot, 
in St. Tropez, locked her house, 
cats licking her purple-veined ankles. 

The Baroness was thinking, pausing like an old steamer. 
Her mascara-clotted eyelids closed 
and for a moment, she erased what she could. 
With mounting unease, she realized 
she might be what was missing. The thought vanished. 
Should she warn the couple? Although not feminine, 
she was maternal. Then that thought passed. 
She shrugged and comforted herself.   
Difficult, celibate, implacable, a final time 
she assessed the couple of compromised want, 
aware that nothing blackens the heart like a mariage blanc, 
and stamped them -- Mwah! Mwah! --   
with the imprimatur of two kisses each. 

The relationship lasted three months. 
They had chosen wrongly, and plausibly 
they fell apart, like the couple in Godard's Le Mpris. 
Had she wanted more than a cover?   
Had he covered more than he wanted? 
The heart, behind its casements, is faceted, 
pronged, coveted, intricate and known by few. 
He could not be kept. She withdrew her money. 
Reconciliation occurred after they ceased speaking. 
On their last night in Monaco, she turned to him 
and wondered if her life had meant anything. 
He did not answer: he had developed a grace 
for offering himself to those who found truth difficult. 
When they left the restaurant, she paid 
using a heavy, black American Express card. 
Each took a doggy bag and smelled of cooked meat. 
This alignment of opposite sexes 
had provided solace, and for a time, 
each had assumed a place, discerned a way to live. 

Indeed, they lived on, never to see each other again, 
both aware the one had harmed the other: 
whether intended or not, the act could not be undone. 
What they recalled, when they recalled, was often wrong, 
or was it that so much went wrong and that was why 
they kept recalling? At the mention of Monaco, 
they recounted certain adornments --   
agapanthus purpling, old men playing boules, 
and blue yachts tilting on a malachite sea, 
or were they malachite yachts tilting on a blue sea? 
Wherever they went henceforth --   
the Htel du Cap, the Boboli Gardens, 
or even simple, small places in America --   
their minds would inexorably turn, 
and then return, to that interval in Monaco, 
where they saw the truth and the truth was . . . 

Monaco, Monaco --   
frivolous, ridiculous, miniscule principality. 
It was there they came to know 
how dangerous beauty could be, how one could disappear into it, 
and with that dark knowledge they traveled on. 
Each, in their separate lives, 
always mentioned Monaco with deference, 
out of shyness, yes, but also shame, and that need 
to abridge the past. Do you recognize them? 
They were not a couple, but they were a pair. 

Tonight the sea pushes against Monaco. 
Jewelry store owners don white gloves, lock their doors. 
The principality has long forgotten the pair. 
Baronesses, marchionesses, and princesses 
have had their portraits painted and affixed to walls. 
The narrow, dead-end streets embed themselves 
into the escarpments like bobby pins. 
The moon spreads her cape of baubles across the sea 
with glamorous transience, enlarging 
behind the dollhouse casino, banks, hotels, 
feeling into the rooms, fingering the miniatures.





The Decision
 

There is a moment before a shape 
hardens, a color sets. 
Before the fixative or heat of kiln. 
The letter might still be taken 
from the mailbox. 
The hand held back by the elbow, 
the word kept between the larynx pulse   
and the amplifying drum-skin of the room's air. 
The thorax of an ant is not as narrow. 
The green coat on old copper weighs more.   
Yet something slips through it -- 
looks around, 
sets out in the new direction, for other lands. 
Not into exile, not into hope. Simply changed. 
As a sandy track-rut changes when called a Silk Road: 
it cannot be after turned back from.





The Pear
 

November. One pear   
sways on the tree past leaves, past reason. 
In the nursing home, my friend has fallen.   
Chased, he said, from the freckled woods 
by angry Thoreau, Coleridge, and Beaumarchais. 
Delusion too, it seems, can be well read. 
He is courteous, well-spoken even in dread. 
The old fineness in him hangs on   
for dear life. "My mind now? 
A small ship under the wake of a large. 
They force you to walk on your heels here, 
the angles matter. Four or five degrees, 
and you're lost. Life is dear to him yet,   
though he believes it his own fault he grieves, 
his own fault his old friends have turned against him 
like crows against an injured of their kind. 
There is no kindness here, no flint of mercy. 
Descend, descend, 
some voice must urge, inside the pear stem. 
The argument goes on, he cannot outrun it. 
Dawnlight to dawnlight, I look: it is still there.





Seawater Stiffens Cloth
 

Seawater stiffens cloth long after it's dried. 
As pain after it's ended stays in the body: 
A woman moves her hands oddly 
because her grandfather passed through 
a place he never spoke of. Making 
instead the old jokes with angled fingers. 
Call one thing another's name long enough, 
it will answer. Call pain seawater, tree, it will answer. 
Call it a tree whose shape of branches happened. 
Call what branching happened a man 
whose job it was to break fingers or lose his own. 
Call fingers angled like branches what peel and cut apples, 
to give to a girl who eats them in silence, looking. 
Call her afterward tree, call her seawater angled by silence. 






All the Difficult Hours and Minutes
 

All the difficult hours and minutes 
are like salted plums in a jar. 
Wrinkled, turn steeply into themselves, 
they mutter something the color of sharkfins to the glass. 
Just so, calamity turns toward calmness. 
First the jar holds the umeboshi, then the rice does.





Osteosarcoma: A Love Poem
 

For Easton, Zooey, and Nacho
Cancer loves the long bone,
the femur and the fibula,
the humerus and ulna,
the greyhound's sleek physique,
a calumet, ribboned with fur
and eddies of dust churned to a smoke,
the sweet slenderness of that languorous
lick of calcium, like an ivory flute or a stalk
of Spiegelau stemware, its bowl
bruised, for an eye blink, with burgundy,
a reed, a wand, the violin's bow --
loves the generous line of your lanky limbs,
the distance between points A and D,
epic as Western Avenue, which never seems to end
but then of course it does, emptying
its miles into the Cal-Sag Channel
that river of waste and sorrow.
I've begun a scrapbook:
here the limp that started it all, here
your scream when the shoulder bone broke,
here that walk to the water dish,
your leg trailing like a length
of black bunting. And here the words I whispered
when your ears lay like spent milkweed pods
on that beautiful silky head:
Run. Run, my boy-o,
in that madcap zigzag,
unzipping the air.





Nebraska
 

1981,   
                  & for three days in Nebraska 
penny loafers are the talk, the thirties sensation 
all over again in one-light towns. 
          Three days in Nebraska, 
& a hundred calves come out bloody &   new 
          as Wahoo & Alma & Dunning hum 

& glow, turned liked searchlights into 
Colorado, where everyone's already wearing 
          their lucky shoes. 
It takes just one look at a boy from Ansley-- 
there is love & there is money 
          & there is everything in between, 
             touched by both-- 
one look at the packs approaching the drag 
in Imperial, 
as first & second boy say hey &hey to third 
& fourth-- 

          Three days in Nebraska, 
          & the bigger 
the sentiment, the harder it falls, &   all over 
the dreams of the pretty 
          end somewhere in New York City, 
but just this one time, 
                                  just these three days   
in Nebraska, the boys are clicking their boots 
& singing 
          I wish I was here in Nebraska 





Hands Are Wood
 

Come see the woodpile behind the cannery. 
Come through the wall 
            to where the wood was chopped 
and the difficult wood was hewed. 
There is a short history of commotion here, 
where a sudden bonfire spat its surprise 
            at the sky-- 

a hundred feet or more the shavings swept 
through disturbed air, and made their own 
music, the music hands make, such a yellow 
crackle and such a thrashing 

in the morning. 
Come wait for the heavy trucks to arrive, 
            the men in dusters cutting the twine, 
loading the long ghostly planks like ballast 
            into iron barges. 

This will be packing for a transatlantic box, 
or paper for essays on schadenfreude, or timber 
for dollhouse dressers, or a twenty baht note 
for the Thai rubber trade. These matchsticks 

will burn whenever you strike them, and this, 
hack at it however you like, is nothing more 
than deadwood for the fire. Come see--now 
even the men are doing only 
                        what they were made to do.





Provincetown Fourth
 

Here we are 
in our doughboys and camos, our doughty frocks 
with drips of bitter on the sleeve, our passions revving 
their pulp to pittance at a gas station 
                                 in the city that never peeps--   

                                 and here is the city 
with its Martians in leather and excoriated thunderbolt- 
boas, its Bible-trippers, its vintage bazookas for barter 
not sale, its reluctance to be reluctant, its speed 
for hire, into which we atrophy ourselves to briefly fit--   

                                 and we are never 
so close to the joys of oil, the grease inside which a fat 
becomes a fit, as we bellow magnanimously praise 
on the least well of those who pass, ones who are dying 

we salute: we are coming from the war, they are going   
to the war--





I Imagine My Fathers Death
 

I imagine my father's death. It is bigger 
than a breadbox. It is bigger than a Ford 
Escort, than a Zeppelin, black and vast 
and slow moving, oozing over an Oklahoma 
arena. It is bigger than any arena, than 
Oklahoma. My father's death is bigger 
than a planet, bigger than the gravity 
wells worlds make, that stars stir up after 
implosion. It is bigger than all the stars. 
It takes up all space, all dimension, all 
that is or ever was. It hates everything 
it isn't. It makes new space, new matter 
from all it is. My father's death takes on 
form and void and says, "Let there be light. 
And there is light. It says, "Let there be   
worlds. And there are worlds. It says,   
"Let there be a garden and a man in it. 
And there is a man. The man is my father. 
He looks around, marveling at this thing 
his death has made, then sets out to find 
someone, anyone, with whom to share it.





The Imagined Copperhead
 

Without intending to hide, 
the imagined copperhead 
hid on the path ahead, 
unseen on bronze leaves, unheard, 
and a mortal likelihood   
at every step. This was childhood, 
mine, the wood's jihad    
against a boy who'd 
intruded among monkshood, 
wasp, tick, and nettles haired 
with needles. Scrub brush abhorred 
him with a horde 
of welts, bites, and stings, but he'd 
never seen a copperhead, 
though he'd looked hard 
taking, as he'd been ordered, heed. 
The snake wasn't a falsehood, 
though, to him. Dread 
was his nature, and he hared 
through sunlight and shade, head 
swiveling for the copperhead 
he'd begun to covet, the ballyhooed 
killer a camouflaged godhead 
on which his inborn faith cohered, 
and his priesthood.





Blowfly
 

Half awake, I was imagining 
a friend's young lover, her ash blonde hair, the smooth 
taut skin of twenty. I imagined her 
short legs and dimpled knees. 
                                                                                     The door scraped open, 
but eyes closed, I saw nothing. The mattress sagged. 
She laid her head on my chest, and murmured love 
against my throat, almost humming, approaching song, 
so palpable I could hold her only chastely, 
if this was chaste. I couldn't move my hand 
even to caress her freckled shoulder. 
So this is how imagination works, I thought, 
sadly. And when at last she spoke, 
she spoke with the amused voice of my wife, 
my wife who was at work but also here, 
pleased at the confusion she was causing. 
This is a lesson about flesh, isn't it? 
I asked. Blowfly, she whispered on my throat 
as we made tense, pensive love. Blowfly, blowfly.





Photo (Op/tative) Synthesis
 

The general increase in green 
accords in me 
with a growing and specific gravity 
about -- it hopes --   
to be undone like a bud. 

What kind of leaf 
or the existence of bugs 
or the always later rumor 
of ravishment by wind or water 
don't interest me. 

Sun does. 
Come close. 

Come slow. 
And look me again in the eyes 
as you do.





Infidelity
 

"Talking only makes me feel more alone, 
you said once in the car outside the clinic. 
Two years later, you spoke the same sentence   
word for word one night after friends had gone. 
Within a month, you'd erased yourself. . . 
Erased? "To absent oneself, I found scribbled on 
a wrapper a year later. . . 
                                                                     Now sunlight and tree 
shadow rush over the windshield of the car: 
I'm talking with my new wife -- then gone, absented. 
"Sometimes I feel almost too much joy,   
you wrote from the balcony of your cheap 
hotel in Paris. "What are you thinking? she asks. 
Light shutters across us. Wherever you are 
in me I'm there, though it's not what you wanted.





Skink
 

Gram of mania, animated pepper, 
shadow-monger dressed in panic, 
monitor of ghostly footfalls, 
it concentrates in its essential tic 
the frog leg dropped into oil 
and the human shock at the verge. 
If it would stop and let me look, 
I might imagine the tropic 
where it hangs in a hammock 
between two popsicle sticks 
admiring the iguana's stealth, 
but it does not stop. Hawk- 
dodger, crow-pretzel, gallows' 
twitch. Spider-shark. Porter 
of readiness, miller of the 
steady shudder, peripatetic 
rectitude, run by the power 
of the sunlit rock, it fortifies 
Darwin and the idea of being late 
and the missed appointment. 
With its blue tail, it reminds us: 
it will go on. It will not stop.





Empire
 

He wore a little spiraled hat and wrote a song 
that everyone sang. He lived on the mountainside 
above a lake with a mythical beast he'd subdued. 
A train circled the village each hour, over and over, 
as he leaned down over the clock of his world 
where people were days becoming months and years. 
In a park, from the hides of ten cows, he'd constructed 
a giant ball that everyone touched until it became 
a torn rag. He had no family, and because he worried 
so much about them: What if, what if, what if, like another 
beast pawing away, he'd invented a vitamin for everyone 
old that allowed you to continue slowly to grow 
until you forgot everything you once knew.





Colonoscopy Sonnet
 

On the news tonight, a presidential 
colonoscopy -- a tale of   how 
for three whole hours the chief exec of trouble 
handed trouble to his vice (although 
no double trouble came), but then no more 
details revealed: no bacterial armies 
multiplying in a flare of war 
among kingly polyps & no kinky creases. 

Welcome to the presidential gut, 
bubble gum pink, not a spot of shit 
(after a quick administrative cleanout) 
where global decisions stir & sit in state, 
       and the first physician's mighty pointer traces 
       only microdrops of blood in secret places.





The Cause
 

Unreel the human weave to molten stone 
And still you'll find the upraised arm of Cain. 

The hand that rigged the flesh in Abu Ghraib 
Caressed another's for the feel of home.





Sustenance
 

I tracked it through the one mind of the woods. 
Its hoofprints pressed in snow were smallish hearts. 
Buck fawn: he let me come so near, take aim. 
Crouched against a fir, I was anything. 
Bush, stump, doe in estrus he could rut. 
Not his maimer, though, not his final thought. 
He stared me down until I shot him: low. 
Then the forest forgot he'd ever been. 
Nascent, there were signs: bonechip, spoor, frail hair. 
But no memory, wounded, wants to die. 
He hid in the dark timber, twice crossed the creek. 
Finally he lay heaving out last breaths. 
Dusk-cast shadow, he died where he was made. 
A bite of heart sustains but is not him.





Get Up,  John
 

Here comes dawn and nothing rosy 
about her fingers -- stove-flame 
blue and some hand must've turned 
the burner on: the little tongues 
licking, gradually, the teapot of us 
aboil, cooking off a giardia 
of stars, the dregs of our night- 
mares. Who will place his fingers 
in the nailmarks, come near enough 
to smell death in its hair? Already we've 
some of us slid back into our bodies, 
restirring the air our breaths stirred 
all night -- whoever we are while 
we sleep -- and gone about believing 
we are here. Ambulance sirens 
assure us, a plum's sour skin, what's become 
of the poppies, dried all but greenless, 
etcetera. But the yearling child 
reaching into the lineaments of sun 
lancing between his crib bars -- how might 
this shame us, that they seem 
to seem graspable to him?





Landscape with Scavengers and Bonelight
 

All day the ravens shit the buck whitetail 
back onto his antlers, the thick arcing tines 
graffitied with undigested tendons. Coyote- 
dragged, draped in a squawking garment 
that rises tattered when redtail-harried -- 
revealing ribs, links of spine, tongue-clean 
sockets -- and falls, in patches, back, stitched 
with wingsound. A feathered hush. Says you will 

go down in the dirt. First the four-leggeds 
ferrying your shape across the slough, yipping 
nothing resembling a name, large birds then like 

lamp-drawn moths, before the six-limbed elders 
arrive as one mind, as shifting soil, to polish 
what's left, forsaking only the inedible brain.





Ensor
 

There, garland dandelions round that idol 
with a corn husk face & beard 
patched with rat stubble from a barber's dust pan, 

parade float driven by a carriage pulled by a pig. 
Two sticks knotted together, 
cake frost on that crude wood to make it gilt. 

There, spider cranks & iron gyres, 
blueberry stain glass sprout 
like wings from coal burn cars, 

a trumpet toots the sorrow of another boy dead, 
there he is, limp on a gurney wrapped in gingham scrap, 
there, he's blast. 

There, roofless houses, 
sarong utopias balloon, balloon toward the sky, 
while women beat, beat their skulls. 

I trail behind, mop in hand, 
sloshing scum water over memorials. 
There he stares at my tic-torn cankered face, 

& begs for alms, his face horse rudder red. 
A son, he huffs, it is a son I want. 
I spit into them corned mitt hands.





They Come
 

Stamp the earth rind down, 
shuck our boots & nap on 
rubber cockscomb pad. 

Rise up & ride in, 
poles poked through with hide of kid 
flap from blither wind. 

Ride into a town of tires stacked, 
a tarred prehistoric castle. 

A town of shacks painted kiwi green 
latches guano rimmed. 
Road's a batter of blood & dust. 

One serf scurries off cowed & cloaked. 
Linseed-eyed & broad of face. 
Hold, I say. 

She says oh gods once nested on our tire hills 
but now that tire factory flakes to tinder too. 
Are you here from the world above? 

Now come. Heal my kin. 
Are you here from the world above? 

We douse ourselves with flame retardant 
& douse the town to flame. 
Are you here from the world above? 

We hear her death in flames 
We hear other deaths in flames   
Along each town we pass 

We rave & rove & gore 
the last oil rig hidalgo in his tin gilt throne, 
His ale we drink, his heart we jar. 

We are from the world above, 
We sing & jig but like Sisyphus, 
as we eye from afar, 

as each child crawls out their gutted hole, 
& rebuild each dead town --   
We can never rest.





The Beautiful Animal
 

By the time I recalled that it is also 
terrifying, we had gone too far into 
the charmed woods to return. It was then 

the beautiful animal appeared in our path: 
ribs jutting, moon-fed eyes moving 
from me to you and back. If we show 

none of the fear, it may tire of waiting 
for the triggering flight, it may ask only 
to lie between us and sleep, fur warm 

on our skin, breath sweet on our necks 
as it dreams of slaughter, as we dream 
alternately of feeding and taming it 

and of being the first to run. The woods 
close tight around us, lying nested here 
like spoons in a drawer of knives, to see 

who wakes first, and from which dream.





jesus knew
 

unlike you and I jesus knew he'd die 

some days a headache woke him it 

lingered nothing terrible but the word 

hung around his temples like this 

soul everyone wants but can't find jesus 

knew he'd die he just didn't know how 

& that bothered him sometimes & then 

he'd do one of his little bootleg tricks 

what the hell, didn't hurt anyone 

didn't make anyone disappear for- 

ever but the tricks stopped working he forgot 

why he did them & what for he confused 

a story about a guy named jesus 

with a story about a father he never knew 

& it all began to hang like a motheaten coat 

pulled out of a trunk on shaky days hey let's 

return to the scene of the fucken tragedy at least 

we all know how it turns out instead of this end- 

less uncertainty hey let's sell our souls a few 

more times no one's really counting (those 

little papers you trade for your sins, 

what do you call them? anyone? no?) 

--anyway--jesus this jesus that 

god of nickel god of dime 

right, the real jesus he was lost he walked in- 

to the desert not far really his friends his 

disciples he told them he'd come back 

like us he said this every time he left but jesus 

never said wait never pointed to the sky 

never claimed he'd rise again never asked us to eat 

his flesh jesus never asked anything as far 

as I can tell he got tired everyday & then slept 

sometimes okay sometimes un- 

bearable, the dreams, the father 

pointing a finger at everyone a finger we can't 

even look at.





self-exam (my body is a cage)
 

Do this: take two fingers, place them on 
the spot behind your ear, either 

ear, the spot where your skull drops off 

into that valley of muscle 
& nerve--that is the muscle that holds up 

the skull, that turns the dumb bone 
this way & that, that nods your face up & 

down when you think you 
get it--press deeper, touch the little bundle of 

nerves buried there, buried in 
the gristle--the nerves that make you blink 

when the light bewilders you, that make your tongue 
slide in & out when you think you're in 

love, when you think you need a drink, touch 
that spot as if you have an itch, close your eyes & 

listen, please, close 
your eyes--can you hear it? We think our souls live 

in boxes, we think someone sits behind our eyes,
lording in his little throne, steering the fork to 

the mouth, the mouth to the tit, we think 
hungry children live in our bellies & run out with their 

empty bowls as the food rains 
down, we sometimes think we are those 

hungry children, we think 
we can think anything & it won't 

matter, we think we can think cut out her tongue, 
& then ask her to sing.





A Regret
 

Kurt, early 
twenties. Met 
him after 
an AA 
meeting in 
Silverlake 
(November, 
eighty-five). 
I remem- 
ber standing 
with him up- 
stairs, in the 
clubhouse, how 
I checked his 
body out. 
But not who 
approached whom. 
Or what we 
talked about 
before we 
leaned against 
my car and 
kissed, under 
that tarnished 
L.A. moon. 
Drove to my 
place and un- 
dressed him in 
the dark. He 
was smaller 
than me. I 
couldn't keep 
my hands off 
his ass. Next 
morning, smoked 
till he woke, 
took him back. 
He thanked me 
sweetly. I 
couldn't have 
said what I 
wanted, though 
must have known. 
Drove home and 
put him in 
a poem 
("November") 
I was at 
the end of. 

Later that 
day it rained 
(I know from 
the poem).





[listen mother, he punched the air: I am not your son dying]
 

a stabat mater
listen mother, he punched the air:   I am not your son dying 
the day fades and the starlings roost:   a body's a husk a nest of goodbye 

his wrist colorless and soft was not a stick of chewing gum 
how tell?    well a plastic bracelet with his name for one.    & no mint 
his eyes distinguishable from oysters how?    only when pried open 

she at times felt the needle going in.    felt her own sides cave.    she rasped 
she twitched with a palsy:   tectonic plates grumbled under her feet 

soiled his sheets clogged the yellow BIOHAZARD bin:   later to be burned 
soot clouds billowed out over the city:   a stole.    a pillbox hat    [smart city] 
and wouldn't the taxis stop now.    and wouldn't a hush smother us all 

the vascular walls graffitied and scarred.    a clotted rend in the muscle 
wend through the avenues throttled t-cells.    processional staph & thrush   

the scourge the spike a stab a shending bile the grace the quenching 
mother who brought me here, muddler:   open the window.    let birds in





What Kind of Times Are These
 

There's a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill 
and the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows 
near a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted 
who disappeared into those shadows. 

I've walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread, but don't be fooled 
this isn't a Russian poem, this is not somewhere else but here, 
our country moving closer to its own truth and dread, 
its own ways of making people disappear. 

I won't tell you where the place is, the dark mesh of the woods 
meeting the unmarked strip of light-- 
ghost-ridden crossroads, leafmold paradise: 
I know already who wants to buy it, sell it, make it disappear. 

And I won't tell you where it is, so why do I tell you 
anything? Because you still listen, because in times like these 
to have you listen at all, it's necessary 
to talk about trees.





Animal Graves
 

The mower flipped it belly up, 
a baby garter less than a foot long, 
dull green with a single sharp 

stripe of pale manila down its back, 
same color as the underside 
which was cut in two places, 

a loop of intestine poking out. 

It wouldn't live, 
so I ran the blades over it again, 

and cut it again but didn't kill it, 

and again and then again, 
a cloud of two-cycle fuel smoke 
on me like a swarm of bees. 

It took so long 
my mind had time to spiral 
back to the graveyard 

I tended as a child 
for the dead ones, wild and tame: 
fish from the bubbling green aquarium, 

squirrels from the road, 
the bluejay stalked to a raucous death 
by Cicero the patient, the tireless hunter, 

who himself was laid to rest 
one August afternoon 
under a rock painted gray, his color, 

with a white splash for his white splash. 

Once in the woods I found the skeleton 
of a deer laid out like a diagram, 

long spine curved like a necklace of crude, ochre spools 
with the string rotted away, 

and the dull metal shaft of the arrow 
lying where it must have pierced 

not the heart, not the head, 
but the underbelly, the soft part 
where the sex once was. 

I carried home the skull 
with its nubs of not-yet-horns 
which the mice had overlooked, 

and set it on a rock 
in my kingdom of the dead. 

Before I chopped the little snake 
to bits of raw mosaic, 

it drew itself 
into an upward-straining coil, 
head weaving, mouth open, 

hissing at the noise that hurt it. 

The stripe was made 
of tiny paper diamonds, 
sharp-edged but insubstantial, 

like an x-ray of the spine 
or the ghost beginning to pull away. 

What taught the snake to make itself 
seem bigger than it was, 
to spend those last few seconds 

dancing in the roar 
and shadow of its death? 

Now I see, though none exists, 
its grave: 

harebells withered in a jar, 
a yellow spiral 
painted on a green-black stone, 

a ring of upright pine cones for a fence. 
That's how the deer skull lay in state 

until one of the neighborhood dogs 
came to claim it, 

and carried it off to bury 
in the larger graveyard of the world.





The Immortal Pilots
 

The noise throws down 
twin shadows, hunting shadows 
on a black joy ride. 

They roar up the silver vein of the river 
and out over the stony peaks, 

which have been shrunken to a luminous 
green musculature on the screens. 
Who are the pilots, too high to see 

the splayed hearts of deer tracks 

under the apple trees, or smell 
the cider in the fallen fruit? 

Who are the vandals that ransack 
the wilderness of clouds? 

Below them, a thin froth of waterfall 
spills from a rock face. 
They see its sudden wreckage, 

its yielding gouts, 

and the wind tear into the papery 
leaves of the poplars, roughing them up 

so the undersides show-- 
a glimpse of paleness 
like a glimpse of underwear. 

The pilots are young men, 
and still immortal. 

Already in the cold 
quadrants of their hearts 
they imagine the whole world 

flowering beneath them. It feels 
like love, like being with a woman 
who flowers beneath them, 

so that they wonder 
how it would feel to go on 
riding the young green world that way, 

to a climax of spectral light.





Stripped Car
 

There's something in me that likes 
to imagine the things I'm afraid of, 

for example, the future. 
I don't mean the celestial fireworks 

from melting reactors, or New York 
under six feet of sea water, 
but the future in its most intimate, 

most probable forms--vignettes 
subversive enough to slip through the radar. 

That's how I come to be crouched 
behind a stripped car wondering 

would it be too dangerous 
to piss in the street? 
It would, I'm a woman. 

So I go on holding it, 
distracting myself by trying to remember 
every fruit I've ever eaten, 

their exact textures and flavors. 
So far the most exotic is the custard apple. 

I use up a whole hour of daylight 
and then another--apricot, blueberry, plum-- 

calves cramping from having to stay low, 
waiting behind a car pitted 

with the acne of automatic fire. 

There are still too many guns 
walking around out there, 
and no one I know, 

so I'm waiting for twilight at least. 
Is everyone alone now? 

The wind says so. It says 
a winter is coming without oil. 

It bites to get my attention 
and scatters a few leaflets, 
pictures of a blackened car, 

a city that seems to catch on fire 
every sunset, though there's 
little enough to burn. Stone only chars. 

This isn't a likeness of the future, is it? 
Every person in the street a stranger? 

Will a word like neighbor' survive this? 

I fired a gun once. It smelled rancid, sour, 
like bad food. It hurt my shoulder 

and left a wound of oil on my shirt. 

My mind is thinking of sleep again. 
Sleep lets things escape--my pocket-knife 

vanished through a knife-sized hole. 

There's nothing to cut, 
no guava, nectarine, winter pear, 

and nothing left of the car at all, 
not even the rear-view mirror 
I was counting on, 

hoping my face could tell me 
it was safe to go home, and where is that? 

A place with a bed 
and a desk where I sit and plot 
next year's garden on graph paper. 

The skin of a tangelo is faintly pebbly, 
easy to peel, but the sweetest citrus 

is the satsuma, then the clementine. 
If I had to choose between natural 
disaster and a firing squad, 

I'd take the river of lava any day. 

Hurricane, tidal wave, tornado, drought. 
I want the earth, which is waiting 
under the sidewalk, to be the one. 

Not any of these human shadows 
sporting their silhouetted guns. 
There were gun shadows before, 

but the two worlds overlapped, 
guns and the amber waves of grain. 

It's hard to say whether bramble fruits 
actually have skins. Does a rasberry? 
Does each tiny globe have its own? 

How will I live without the earth? 

In a stripped car, unable to piss 
when I want to, all the time cold? 

Maybe weapons interbred with humans, 
and a strain of hybrids was born, 
half metal, half flesh. 

I know there's an enemy-- 
look at all the damage it's doing. 
Maybe it's still a baby, 

its weak neck wobbling as its carriage 
lurches over the broken pavement. 

But probably by now 
it's a sulking adolescent 
starting to look like serious trouble, 

with a silky little shadow-moustache 
and a gun. Who'll kill it? Will I? 

What if it doesn't look like the enemy? 
What if it comes disguised as a savior, 
or resembles nothing so much as hunger, 

so that everyone has his own 
private piece to kill? Will we do it?





Pine
 

The first night at the monastery, 
a moth lit on my sleeve by firelight, 
long after the first frost. 

A short stick of incense burns 
thirty minutes, fresh thread of pine 
rising through the old pine of the hours. 

Summer is trapped under the thin 
glass on the brook, making 
the sound of an emptying bottle. 

Before the long silence, 
the monks make a long soft rustling, 
adjusting their robes. 

The deer are safe now. Their tracks 
are made of snow. The wind has dragged   
its branches over their history.





Hunger for Something
 

Sometimes I long to be in the woodpile, 
cut-apart trees soon to be smoke, 
or even the smoke itself, 

sinewy ghost of ash and air, going 
wherever I want to, at least for a while. 

Neither inside nor out, 
neither lost nor home, no longer 
a shape or a name, I'd pass through 

all the broken windows of the world. 
It's not a wish for consciousness to end. 

It's not the appetite an army has 
for its own emptying heart, 
but a hunger to stand now and then 

alone on the death-grounds, 
where the dogs of the self are feeding.





To the Reader: If You Asked Me
 

I want you with me, and yet you are the end 
of my privacy. Do you see how these rooms 
have become public? How we glance to see if-- 
who? Who did you imagine? 
Surely we're not here alone, you and I. 

I've been wandering 
where the cold tracks of language 
collapse into cinders, unburnable trash. 
Beyond that, all I can see is the remote cold 
of meteors before their avalanches of farewell. 

If you asked me what words 
a voice like this one says in parting, 
I'd say, I'm sweeping an empty factory 
toward which I feel neither hostility nor nostalgia. 
I'm just a broom, sweeping.





To the Reader: Twilight
 

Whenever I look 
out at the snowy 
mountains at this hour 
and speak directly 
into the ear of the sky, 
it's you I'm thinking of. 
You're like the spirits 
the children invent 
to inhabit the stuffed horse 
and the doll. 
I don't know who hears me. 
I don't know who speaks 
when the horse speaks.





The Tongues We Speak
 

I have arrived here after taking many steps 
Over the kitchen floors of friends and through their lives. 

The dun-colored hills have been good to me 
And the gold rivers. 

I have loved chrysantheumums, and children: 
I have been grandmother to some. 

In one pocket I have hidden chocolates from you 
And knives. 

Speaking my real thoughts to no one 

In bars and at lecterns I have told the truth 
Fairly often, but hardly ever to myself. 

I have not cried out against the crimes of my country 

But I have protected myself, I have watched from a safe corner 
The rape of mountains, the eagle's reckless plunge. 


Ever since high school I have waved goodbye to history: 

I have assisted you to grow 
In all ways that were convenient to me. 

What is a block vote against steam shovels? 

My current events teacher was a fine man 
But his moral precepts were a put-up job and I followed them. 

Well-dressed, in my new Adidas 
At every gathering I investigated my psyche with friends 

And they investigated theirs with me. 


But whenever Trouble came in the front door I ran out the back 
And fell into the pit of my bones. 

Escaped from those burning buildings, the past, 
What balance can any of us hope for? 

I was comparing lipsticks 
The day Nagasaki vanished. 

The day Solzhenitsyn disappeared into the Gulag 
I was attending a cocktail party. 

Perhaps there are only ashes in my handbag. 

A man at the corner of Broadway and Forty-Second Street 
Tried to sweep me into a trash barrel and I almost agreed. 

Already the dried blood was sifting along my wrists. 

Already my own hands 
Were tightening around my throat 


But Sorrow saved me, Sorrow gave me an image 
Of bombs like human tears watering the world's gardens. 

How could I not answer? 

Since then I have been planting words 
In every windowbox, poking them to grow up. 

What's God, That he should be mindful of me? 

Sometimes I feel like wood 
Waiting for someone to peel me. 


Indeed I have been lukewarm 
At heart, which is all that matters. 

Of tiny bread-colored atoms, 
Equal fragments equally dispersed 

That love each other and are never hungry. 


What have I ever ignited 
That warmed anyone? 

I have not followed the rivers. 

Dangerous as a pine needle 
Packed in among others, in the dense multitudes 

And dry timbers of the West 

I am afraid of greed, 
The rich taste of it, the anger 

Hidden in my pockets. 


Columns of smoke on the horizon, 
Pillars of green fire. 

But I have arrived here somehow, 
Neither have I stopped talking. 

Numberless are the kitchens I have sat in, 
Chewing my fingers, trying to say something, 

Anything, so that the daughters of men should see 
As many sides of themselves as possible. 


Word after word my footprints 
Have stumbled across deserts. 

How should I escape them? 
They keep following after me. 

A little wind stirs itself, 
Whisks across my eyelids, 

And I know what it is before I say it: 

What if the world really articulates itself 
In the socket of a human knee? 


God save me 
From the swamps of hubris but it may be, it may be. 

Before the idea, the impulse. 

I feel it moving in me, it is there 
Arthritic but still powerful, a seizure 

Delicate as grasshoppers, a light 
Gathering in the skull. 

Between thumb and forefinger 
And the ballbearing joints of the tongue 

In soft, glottal convulsions 
Out of no alien skies 

But out of the mind's muscle 
The hieroglyph figures rise. 


The little histories of words 
Cannot be eaten. 

I know it, you know it 
And the children... 

But the images we make are our own. 

In the cool caves of the intellect 
The twisted roots of them lead us 

Backwards and then forwards. 


If only we could understand 
What's in our pockets is for everyone! 

I have a dictionary in one hand, a mirror. 

Strangers look at themselves in it, 
Tracing the expressions they use 

From one family to the next 
They comfort themselves, murmuring 

The tongues we speak are a blizzard 
Of words like warm wool flying: 

In the shy conjugal rites 
Of verb, consonant, vowel, 

In the dark mucosal flesh lining 
The prismed underside of the skin 

Each one is a spark sheared 
From the veined fleece of the spirit 

Of the looking-glass body we live in. 

It is the one I have been cherishing, 
The one all of us speak from, 

For the world as we know it moves 
Necessarily by steps. 

Breath, pulse beat, ten digital stops. 

At the foot of the mountains I look up. Does God 
Lift up His hand to cover them? 

Blinded by tears like rain 
My bones turn granite, the spine of the hills congeals them. 


Where is the eye of the storm, 
Or where is the center of my seeing? 

The wind of my breath is a hurricane: 
I am locked inside myself. 

Painfully, up the bald stepladder I climb, 

But sometimes the light in my head goes on 
More like the sun than a match. 

Just as they said in Arabia 

There's a huge pantalooned angel swelling 
Inside the body's glass jar. 

The white-haired thread of steam 
From the teakettle on the range whistles 

And sharpens itself into a voice 

Bodiless as history, invisible 
But still whispering in ears 

That keep trying to hear it. 

It is as if midgets were bellowing their names 
Down sets of cardboard cylinders. 

But we have not disappeared 
Yet. 

My friends, we have said many things to each other 

In new combinations, seed upon seed exploding 
And blossoming in kitchen gardens. 

I confess I am ashamed of myself: 

I have not tried hard enough to understand 
Or listen to you speak. 


But the Word is mindful of itself 
And always has been. 

Littering every street 

In the sly eyes of tin cans, 
Drops of water in the gutter 

The world looks back at us 


From every known language: 
Yoruba, Hebrew, Chinese, 

Arrogant English, the subject 
Subjecting all to its desires, 

Even the softer tongues, romantic 

Self-reflexive, done to 
As we would be done by, 

Whatever life we cultivate 
Out of the animal moans of childhood 

It is all wheat fields, all grass 
Growing and being grown. 

With poisoned bread in my pockets, or gumdrops, 
Or armies like Myrmidons rising 

What I say is true 
For a time only, thank God, 

If I have only arrived anywhere it is to look 
Carefully, at all I thought I knew. 


In living rivers of speech 
The reflections I make are my own 

And yet not: 

Though the old growth rings are hidden from us 
And the echoing tomorrows of the acorn, 

The warm currents of the senses 
Are a two-way street, my friends: 

The palms of our hands are crisscrossed 
With as many intersections as a leaf.





The Reading Club
 

Is dead serious about this one, having rehearsed it for two weeks 
they bring it right into the Odd Fellows Meeting Hall. 
Riding the backs of the Trojan Women, 
In Euripides' great wake they are swept up, 

But the women of the chorus, in black stockings and kerchiefs, 
Stand up bravely to it, shawled arms thrash 
In a foam of hysterical voices shrieking, 
Seaweed on the wet flanks of a whale, 

For each town has its Cassandra who is a little crazy, 
Wed to some mystery or other and therefore painfully sensitive, 
Wiser than anyone but no one listens to her, these days the terror 
Reaches its red claws into back ward and living room alike, 

For each town has its Andromache who is too young, 
With snub nose and children just out of school 
Even she cannot escape it, from the bombed city she is led out 
Weeping among the ambulances, 

And each community has its tart, its magical false Helen 
Or at least someone who looks like her, in all the make-up she can muster, 
The gorgeous mask of whatever quick-witted lie will keep her alive 
At least a little while longer, on the crest of the bloody wave, 

That dolorous mountain of wooden ships and water 
In whose memory the women bring us this huge gift horse, 
This raging animal of a play no one dares to look in the eye 
For fear of what's hidden there: 

Small ragdoll figures toppling over and over 
From every skyscraper and battlement hurtling 
Men and women both, mere gristle in the teeth of fate. 
Out over the sea of the audience our numb faces 

Are stunned as Andromache's, locked up there on the platform 
Inside Euripides' machine the women sway and struggle 
One foot at a time, up the surging ladder 
Of grief piled on grief, strophe on antistrophe, 

In every century the same, the master tightens the screws, 
Heightens the gloss of each bitter scene 
And strikes every key, each word rings out 
Over our terrified heads like a brass trumpet, 

For this gift is an accordion, the biggest and mightiest of all, 
As the glittering lacquered box heaves in and out, 
Sigh upon sigh, at the topmost pitch a child 
Falls through midnight in his frantically pink skin. 

As the anguished queen protests, the citizens in the chorus wail 
Louder and louder, the warriors depart 
Without a glance backwards, these captains of the world's death 
Enslaved as they are enslavers, in a rain of willess atoms 

anonymity takes over utterly: as the flaming city falls 
On this bare beach, in the drab pinewood hall 
The Reading Club packs up to go; scripts, coffee cups, black stockings, 
Husbands and wives pile into the waiting cars 

Just as we expect, life picks up and goes on 
But not art: crouched back there like a stalled stallion 
Stuffed in its gorgeous music box is the one gift 
That will not disappear but waits, but bides its time and waits 

For the next time we open it, that magical false structure 
Inside whose artifice is the lesson, buried alive, 
Of the grim machinations of the beautiful that always lead us 
To these eternally real lamentations, real sufferings, real cries.





You Could Pick It Up
 

You could pick it up by the loose flap of a roof 
and all the houses would come up together 
in the same pattern attached, inseparable 

white cubes, olive trees, flowers 
dangling from your hand 
a few donkey hooves might stick out 

flailing the air for balance, 
but the old women would cling like sea urchins 
and no children would fall. 

Even though it is small, 
the people are Greek, and it sits 
like an oyster in the middle of the Aegean 

still it is tough, it reminds you 
of wagon trains, prairie schooners 
drawn up in circles by night 

you could swing it around your head 
and still nothing would happen, 
it would stay 

solid, the white walls 
rising up out of the sea 
the pillared crown of the temple... 

For twenty-six hundred years 
it has endured everything, but now 
we who have forgotten everything, 

we whose homes have all gone 
to super highways, belt cities, long thin lines 
our glittering buses snort into the main square, 

the spider web with sticky fingers 
glues itself to the town, 
slowly it begins to revolve, faster and faster 

tighter and tighter it is wound 
till the young men cannot stand it, 
they pack up and leave town 

the sky is full of children 
with wild eyes and huge faces 
falling to the ground.





The Hills in Half Light
 

Or will we be lost forever? 

In the silence of the last breath 
Not taken 

The blue sweep of your arm like a dancer 
Clowning, in wrinkled pajamas, 

Across the sky the abrupt 
Brief zigzag of a jay... 

All night the whiteness 
And all day. 

Once we have been lifted up 
Into empty morning like ice 

In the darkness of these white fields 

Neither the ghost tracks of skis 
Nor steel skates will wake us 

Where are we looking for each other, separated 

On the opposite hillside I see you 
Miles away from me, a dot 

Of faint color reddening, small bruised warmth 
Opening its cranberry mouth and saying, 

What are you saying? 

                                        * 

Under a cold blanket 

An immense loneliness stretches 
In every direction with no fences. 

A few sticks tweak the crusted snow: 

Thin remnants of an army 
Of lost soldiers. 

I see footsteps ahead of me but whose 

And where will they lead me, parallel 
Or converging? Is it not possible there will be one jet trail 

That will not vanish, 

Two phantom ribbons unfolding 
That will not feather themselves away? 

                                       * 

Wrapped in our white parkas 

In what shifting laminations, snowflakes 
That mean nothing, transparent eyes spitting, 

What glacier will we choose to lie on, 
In what igloo rest 

Barely breathing, in an air pocket 
Just below the surface 

Rustling beneath blizzards 

Where is your foot, most beautiful 
With blue toenails 

I will be looking for it always 

Wherever it is, next to me 
In the darkness 

Of rumpled white sheets, 
Pale siftings, clouds 

Sudden scarves of ourselves gusting 
Loose, sandpapery as snow lifting 

In what chill citadel of ice crystals 
Will I find you?





Danger of Falling
 

The way calcium grows 

all by itself into bone, microscopic 
fraction attaches itself to fraction 

or clouds crystallize, or blizzards congeal into hard 
ice on aluminum wings, 

even the astronauts' bodysuits can't cover up 
the sheer strangeness of it, the extraordinary being-here 

or anywhere, the skin of the plane could easily peel back 
like an ear of corn and then what's to be seen but who, me? 

the live, disintegrating, 
terrified Barbie Doll asks, stuffed into her jeans 

like a stick of butter, her neat, pointed feet dangerously 
stuck into sky... 

but still, teetering down the aisle 
if anyone bumps her she glares,  This Is My Territory, 

this little packet of a hundred and twenty-two 
pounds more or less says Move it, Babe, 

one minute the cold kitchen, next minute Miami Beach, 
digging into the sand beside the violent- 

ly green sea, droplets of Almighty coconut oil 
under the crisp tang of salt drizzle and lick 

all over its bare, lusciously bronzed congregation 
of too too solid-- 

No! Never in this world, the greedy molecules hiss 

as the plane turns inland, the woman returns to her seat 
past all the other anonymous collections of cells, 

some snoring, some fussing with their kids, 
one bent over a laptop, another staring 

straight at her for a second, with X-ray 
exhausted eyes peering, then swiveling away 

as if they'd known each other before, fellow crew members 
from another planet, 

though the woman thinks of herself only on Main Street--my 
my what an arrangement of chromosomes collected 

who knows why--up here among streaked, boiling clouds 
with the plane speeding through them, how 

unexpected it is, how far the body travels 
from its babyhood, locked in its charged circuits 

she thinks about edges, the leathery sunburned skin 
flaking off, in filmy shreds, 

sound barriers breaking away from her but here she still is 
for this one second fixed, eyes sticking out of the top of her face 

like the glint of a buried pin or the beak 
of a mother robin in the nest 

she made for herself: 

with earth losing its outer walls 
twig by twig, what is this naked fork quivering 

in the middle of Whose consciousness 

she keeps wondering, whizzing across the face 
of an electric cloud chamber, 

here all I am 
is falling, in the tight ship of the diminished, 

in hot chips of pure 
ignorant energy fizzing around some magnet, 

some lucky iron only 
imagination can count on, 

trembling, gritting her teeth on the thread 
of an end she can't know, 

Please, Someone, materialize me 
in arms I can love always 

she whispers to herself, 
Beam Me Up...





Trauma (Storm)
 

Hunkered down, nerve-numb, 
in the carnal hut, 
the cave of self, 
while outside a storm 
rages. 
          Huddled there, 
rubbing together 
white sticks of 
your own ribs, 
praying for sparks 
in that dark 
where tinder is heart, 
where tender is not.





The River
 

I felt both pleasure and a shiver 
as we undressed on the slippery bank 
and then plunged into the wild river. 

I waded in; she entered as a diver. 
Watching her pale flanks slice the dark 
I felt both pleasure and a shiver. 

Was this a source of the lake we sought, giver 
of itself to that vast, blue expanse? 
We'd learn by plunging into the wild river 

and letting the current take us wherever 
it willed. I had that yielding to thank 
for how I felt both pleasure and a shiver. 

But what she felt and saw I'll never 
know: separate bodies taking the same risk 
by plunging together into the wild river. 

Later, past the rapids, we paused to consider 
if chance or destiny had brought us here; 
whether it was more than pleasure and a shiver 
we'd found by plunging into the wild river.





Memorial Day
 

1 
After our march from the Hudson to the top 
of Cemetery Hill, we Boy Scouts proudly endured 
the sermons and hot sun while Girl Scouts 
lolled among graves in the maple shade. 
When members of the veterans' honor guard 
aimed their bone-white rifles skyward and fired, 
I glimpsed beneath one metal helmet 
the salmon-pink flesh of Mr. Webber's nose, 
restored after shrapnel tore it. 



         2 
Friends who sat near me in school died in Asia, 
now lie here under new stones that small flags flap 
beside. 
          It's fifth-grade recess: war stories. 
Mr. Webber stands before us and plucks 
his glass eye from its socket, holds it high 
between finger and thumb. The girls giggle 
and scream; the awed boys gape. The fancy pocket watch 
he looted from a shop in Germany 
ticks on its chain.





Beggars Song
 

Here's a seed. Food 
for a week. Cow skull 
in the pasture; back room 
where the brain was: 
spacious hut for me. 

Small then, and smaller. 
My desire's to stay alive 
and be no larger 
than a sliver 
lodged in my own heart. 

And if the heart's a rock 
I'll whack it with this tin 
cup and eat the sparks, 
always screaming, always 
screaming for more.





Gathering the Bones Together
 

for Peter Orr   When all the rooms of the house  fill with smoke, it's not enough  to say an angel is sleeping on the chimney.
1. a night in the barn 

The deer carcass hangs from a rafter. 
Wrapped in blankets, a boy keeps watch 
from a pile of loose hay. Then he sleeps 

and dreams about a death that is coming: 
Inside him, there are small bones 
scattered in a field among burdocks and dead grass. 
He will spend his life walking there, 
gathering the bones together. 

Pigeons rustle in the eaves. 
At his feet, the German shepherd 
snaps its jaws in its sleep. 


          2 
A father and his four sons 
run down a slope toward 
a deer they just killed. 
The father and two sons carry 
rifles. They laugh, jostle, 
and chatter together. 
A gun goes off 
and the youngest brother 
falls to the ground. 
A boy with a rifle 
stands beside him, 
screaming. 


          3 
I crouch in the corner of my room, 
staring into the glass well 
of my hands; far down 
I see him drowning in air. 

Outside, leaves shaped like mouths 
make a black pool 
under a tree. Snails glide 
there, little death-swans. 


          4. smoke 
Something has covered the chimney 
and the whole house fills with smoke. 
I go outside and look up at the roof, 
but I can't see anything. 
I go back inside. Everyone weeps, 
walking from room to room. 
Their eyes ache. This smoke 
turns people into shadows. 
Even after it is gone 
and the tears are gone, 
we will smell it in pillows 
when we lie down to sleep. 


          5 
He lives in a house of black glass. 
Sometimes I visit him, and we talk. 
My father says he is dead, 
but what does that mean? 
Last night I found a child 
sleeping on a nest of bones. 
He had a red, leaf-shaped 
scar on his cheek. 
I lifted him up 
and carried him with me, 
though I didn't know where I was going. 


          6. the journey 
Each night, I knelt on a marble slab 
and scrubbed at the blood. 
I scrubbed for years and still it was there. 
But tonight the bones in my feet 
begin to burn. I stand up 
and start walking, and the slab 
appears under my feet with each step, 
a white road only as long as your body. 


          7. the distance 
The winter I was eight, a horse 
slipped on the ice, breaking its leg. 
Father took a rifle, a can of gasoline. 
I stood by the road at dusk and watched 
the carcass burning in the far pasture. 

I was twelve when I killed him; 
I felt my own bones wrench from my body. 
Now I am twenty-seven and walk 
beside this river, looking for them. 
They have become a bridge 
that arches toward the other shore.





The Pond
 

Snapping turtles in the pond eat bass, sunfish, 
and frogs. They do us no harm when we swim. 
But early this spring two Canada geese 
lingered, then built a nest. What I'd 
heard of, our neighbor feared: goslings, 
as they paddle about, grabbed from below 
by a snapper, pulled down to drown. 
                                                                   So he stuck 
hunks of fat on huge, wire-leadered hooks 
attached to plastic milk-bottle buoys. 
The first week he caught three turtles 
and still there are more: sometimes he finds 
the bottles dragged ashore, the wire 
wrapped several times around a pine trunk 
and the steel hook wrenched straight as a pin.





On a Highway East of Selma, Alabama
 

July 1965
As the sheriff remarked: I had no business being there. He was right, but for the wrong reasons. Among that odd crew of volunteers from the North, I was by far the most inept and least effective. I couldn't have inspired or assisted a woodchuck to vote. 
       In fact, when the sheriff's buddies nabbed me on the highway east of Selma, I'd just been released from ten days of jail in Mississippi. I was fed up and terrified; I was actually fleeing north and glad to go. 

       - 

   In Jackson, they'd been ready for the demonstration. After the peaceful arrests, after the news cameras recorded us being quietly ushered onto trucks, the doors were closed and we headed for the county fairgrounds. 
       Once we passed its gates, it was a different story: the truck doors opened on a crowd of state troopers waiting to greet us with their nightsticks out. Smiles beneath mirrored sunglasses and blue riot helmets; smiles above badges taped so numbers didn't show. 
       For the next twenty minutes, they clubbed us, and it kept up at intervals, more or less at random, all that afternoon and into the evening. 
       Next morning we woke to new guards who did not need to conceal their names or faces. A little later, the fbi arrived to ask if anyone had specific complaints about how they'd been treated and by whom. 
       But late that first night, as we sat bolt upright in rows on the concrete floor of the cattle barn waiting for mattresses to arrive, one last precise event: A guard stopped in front of the ten-year-old black kid next to me. He pulled a freedom now pin from the kid's shirt, made him put it in his mouth, then ordered him to swallow. 

       - 

   That stakeout at dusk on Route 80 east of Selma was intended for someone else, some imaginary organizer rumored to be headed toward their dismal, godforsaken town. Why did they stop me? 
       The New York plates, perhaps, and that little bit of stupidity: the straw hat I wore, a souvenir of Mississippi. 
       Siren-wail from an unmarked car behind me--why should I think they were cops? I hesitated, then pulled to the shoulder. The two who jumped out waved pistols, but wore no uniforms or badges. By then, my doors were locked, my windows rolled. Absurd sound of a pistol barrel rapping the glass three inches from my face: "Get out, you son of a bitch, or we'll blow your head off. 
       When they found pamphlets on the backseat they were sure they'd got the right guy. The fat one started poking my stomach with his gun, saying, "Boy, we're gonna dump you in the swamp. 

       - 

   It was a long ride through the dark, a ride full of believable threats, before they arrived at that hamlet with its cinderblock jail. 
       He was very glad to see it, that adolescent I was twenty years ago. For eight days he cowered in his solitary cell, stinking of dirt and fear. He's cowering there still, waiting for me to come back and release him by turning his terror into art. But consciously or not, he made his choice and he's caught in history. 
       And if I reach back now, it's only to hug him and tell him to be brave, to remember that black kid who sat beside him in the Mississippi darkness. And to remember that silence shared by guards and prisoners alike as they watched in disbelief the darkness deepening around the small shape in his mouth, the taste of metal, the feel of the pin against his tongue. 
       It's too dark for it to matter what's printed on the pin; it's too dark for anything but the brute fact that someone wants him to choke to death on its hard shape. 
       And still he refuses to swallow.





Self-Portrait at Twenty
 

I stood inside myself 
like a dead tree or a tower. 
I pulled the rope 
of braided hair 
and high above me 
a bell of leaves tolled. 

Because my hand 
stabbed its brother, 
I said: Make it stone. 

Because my tongue 
spoke harshly, I said: 
Make it dust. 
                   And yet 
it was not death, but 
her body in its green dress 
I longed for. That's why 
I stood for days in the field 
until the grass turned black 
and the rain came.





From a Photograph
 

Her arms around me--child--
Around my head, hugging with her whole arms,
Whole arms as if I were a loved and native rock,
The apple in her hand--her apple and her father, 
                   and my nose pressed
Hugely to the collar of her winter coat--. There 
                   in the photograph

It is the child who is the branch
We fall from, where would be bramble,
Brush, bramble in the young Winter
With its blowing snow she must have thought
Was ours to give to her.





Fugue
 

this is just to say I saw the icebox and wheels 
rumbling through the figure 5 
I saw the white chickens 
in the dark city glazed with rain 
I saw the figure 5 in the white chickens 
the plums that were in gold on a red wheel barrow 
the plums that you were probably 
saving among the rain water 
I have eaten the dark city so sweet 
the plums that were so sweet 
this is just to say I have eaten the figure 5 
in the plums that so much depends 
that were in gold on a red firetruck





Lost in Translation
 

Before devising, your chicken you do not have to count. 
As for the penny which is rescued it is the penny which is obtained. 
The girl and the spice has become entirely from the splendid sugar. 
The boy has consisted of the tail of the slug and the snail and the puppy. 
As for the place of the woman there is a house. 
One basket your egg everything does not have to be made. 
The idiot hurries being about you fear because the angel steps on. 
Your cake cannot do possessing and is eaten thing. 
There is no wastefulness, unless so is, we want. 
The safe which is better than regrettable. 
Living, you have lived, permit.





Summer Job
 

"The trouble with intellectuals, Manny, my boss,   
once told me, "is that they don't know nothing   
till they can explain it to themselves.  A guy like that,   
he said, "he gets to middle age--and by the way,   
he gets there late; he's trying to be a boy until   
he's forty, forty-five, and then you give him five   
more years until that craziness peters out, and now   
he's almost fifty--a guy like that at last explains   
to himself that life is made of time, that time   
is what it's all about.  Aha! he says.  And then   
he either blows his brains out, gets religion,   
or settles down to some major-league depression.   
Make yourself useful.  Hand me that three-eights   
torque wrench--no, you moron, the other one.





Notes for the First Line of a Spanish Poem
 

We remember so little, 
We are certain of nothing. 
We long to perish into the absolute. 
Where is a mountain 
To spread its snowfields for us like a shawl? 

You might begin, 
The men who come to see me are not exactly lovers. 
Or, Seen at a distance the gazelle is blue. 
That's just your way of cheering me up. 

You might begin, 
The quality of the telegram is vulnerable. 
Or even, The spirit of the telegram is virginal. 
By now I am ravenous. 

You might begin, 
Nothing's more passionate than a train, 
Entering an enormous depot, 
Empty except for two lovers, irreconcilable, 
Parting. Then, 
No one's more visible than a blind man on the street. 

Things that are that were never meant to be! 
Terrible music! 

The utter confusion of surfaces! 
The first steps toward probability! 
You might begin, 

Near the edge of the mind, the mind grows defenseless, 
Sleepy in the way it sees, 
Like Columbus on the edge of the world. 
It feels the grip of all it cannot grasp, 
Like the blind man trying to stay out of sight. 
Show me any object, I'll show you rust on a wave. 

You begin, 

Outside the mind, the snow undresses and lies down.





The Measure of the Year
 

A canoe made of horse ribs tipped over in the pasture. 
Prairie flowers took it for a meetinghouse. 
They grow there with a vengeance. 

Buck posts float across the flooded swamp 
Where my father rode in and under. 
Different horse. 

He held her head up out of the mud 
And said how he was sorry 
Till they came to pull him out. 

We found the white filly 
On the only hard ground by the south gate. 
He said she'd been a ghost from the start and he was right. 

We covered her with branches. 
There were things he had the wrong names for 
Like rose crystals. Though 

They were about what you'd think from a name like that. 
He told us somewhere on Sand Creek Pass 
Was a crystal that spelled our own initials 

And we should try to find it. 
We walked through sagebrush and sand currents, looking. 
He said pasqueflowers and paintbrush 

Wait till Easter to grow, 
Then they come up even with snow still on the ground. 
I thought I'd seen that happen.





Getting a Word In
 

Very sad, 
Having to 
Come out of nowhere, 

The rain 
We've been waiting for 
Is waiting too. 

Trees, 
By now, 
Have had enough daylight. 

They'd like, 
Please, 
To sleep it off. 

If nothing 
Else, nothing 
Else. 

Behind our backs 
Things mean themselves. 
Violins crack 

From wanting to exist. 
It's hard, getting a word in. 
I'm waiting 

To arrive inside my clothes, 
If nothing else, 
Willing 

To be (having to 
Come out of nowhere) 
Very sad.





Hermits
 

The more I see of people, the more I like my dog. 
And this would be good country if a man could eat scenery. 

The lake's ice gives light back to the air, 
Shadows back to water. 

In wet years the land breathes out, 
And a crop of limber pines jumps into the open 
Like green pioneers. 
In dry years 
Beetles kill them with roadmaps 
Under the skin. 

The land breathes in. 
The sun goes down, 
And the whole sky cracks like rivermud in drought. 

A few trees make it each time, 
As if some tide carried them out, away from the others. 

They say a tree that falls in timber 
Goes down in good company: 
Snow drifts in and it all goes soft. 

They say a ghost is a ghost 
That doesn't know it's dead yet. 

Those limber pines die standing, lightning-struck, wind broke, 
And enough good pitch 
For a hermit's winter. 

The cabin stood; the man was long dead. 
Packrats nested in the firewood, 
And a crowd of medicine bottles held forth on the shelf. 

When hermits die 
They close their eyes. They never hear 
The parson sermonize how somewhere 
There is hope where no hope was. 

Tanglefoot, 
Dead-On-Your-Feet, 
A chance to be alone for a chance to be abandoned, 
Everything is lost or given. 

Hermits never know they're dead till the roof falls in.





Explication of an Imaginary Text
 

Salt is pity, brooms are fury, 
The waterclock stands for primordial harmony. 

The spruce forest, which is said to be 
Like a cathedral 
Indicates proliferation of desire. 

The real meaning of the beginning 
Will not become clear until later, if ever. 

Things no longer being what they were, 
Artifice poses as process, 
The voice is tinged with melancholy. 

The teacup, the brass knuckles, and the pearl-handled razor 
Resist interpretation 

As if to say 
That half the wind is in the mind 
And half in the mind of the wind. 

Speaking through the character 
Who comes to faith on his deathbed, 

The author makes apology 
For saying things he didn't mean. 
Little girl-cousins with ribbons in their hair 

Confuse him with their names and are carried away 
By laughter. Thus, 

The force of love comes from belief, 
Hate is from lack of doubt. 
Paradox by paradox the narrative proceeds 

Until half the stars are absolute tears. 
The other half are mirrors.





Anthropology
 

Remember the night you got drunk 
and shot the roses? 
You were a perfect stranger, Father, 
even my bad sister cried. 

Some other gravity, 
not death or luck, 
drew fish out of the sea 
and started them panting. 

The fish became a man. 
The archer's bow became a violin. 
I remember the night you searched the sofa 
for change 

and wept on the telephone. 
Some other gravity, 
not time or entropy, 
pulled the knife down for centuries. 

The archers dropped their bows, 
harmless as pine needles in the snow. 
The knife became a plow 
and entered the earth, Father. 

Later it became a boat 
and some other things -- 
It isn't a dream but it takes a long time, 
for the archer's bow to become a violin.





The Last Mans Club
 

My grandfather was always sad. Sadly, as a boy, he paddled his canoe along the beautiful Hudson River, which was only then beginning to die. During the first war he was very sad in France because he knew he was having the time of his life. When it was over everyone in American felt like a hero -- imagine. 

   Once a year on Armistice Day, he met with all his friends from the war. They got drunk and recounted the stories of the time when they had thought they were men and the world had seemed entirely possible. They placed empty chairs for certain of the dead, and in the center of the table, a bottle of cognac from France, for the last man of them to drink alone, in honor of the others. 

   Year after year they gathered to watch each other and themselves disappear, turn into empty chairs. Soomer or later they were all sad. Some of them must have realized they didn't need to join a club for this. 

   Finally it came down to my grandfather and a man named Oscar Cooper. Neither of them wanted to outlive anyone. They couldn't remember what honor was. When they drank the cognac it didn't taste like anything. They threw the bottle in the river as if they thought it meant that neither of them was alive anymore. 

   When Cooper died the following year, my grandfather took his rifle out into the yard and fired three shots at the sky. Then he went down to the river and drank himself to sleep. After that he was never sad, not even when the river died.





from America, America
 

God save America, 
               My home, sweet home! 

We are not hostages, America, 
and your soldiers are not God's soldiers... 
We are the poor ones, ours is the earth of the drowned gods, 
the gods of bulls, 
the gods of fires, 
the gods of sorrows that intertwine clay and blood in a song... 
We are the poor, ours is the god of the poor, 
who emerges out of farmers' ribs, 
hungry 
and bright, 
and raises heads up high... 

America, we are the dead. 
Let your soldiers come. 
Whoever kills a man, let him resurrect him. 
We are the drowned ones, dear lady. 
We are the drowned. 
Let the water come. 

       Damascus, 20/8/1995





Mother's Closet
 

This is everything she ever closed a door 
on, the broom closet of childhood 
where no one could ever find a broom. 
Here, layer upon layer, nothing breathes: 
photo albums curl at the edges, books 
she brought home from the library 
where she worked, handled by thousands 
of other hands before their final exile 
where they've waited, paper and more paper 
taking in the ocean air, about to sprout. 

Mother's sitting on the bed 
with her tattered list of dispersals--who gets 
what among the treasures she hopes 
I'll find, but I know I'm seeing 
what she doesn't want me to see, 
the daughter cleaning doing what the son 
would never do. After an hour of excavation 
the console TV emerges from beneath 
forgotten sweaters and balled up nylons 
saved for stuffing puppets, a long ago church project-- 
the TV arrived in 1966 same day I crushed 
the fender of the car, upsetting 
the careful plans she'd made for payment. 

She wants to leave so much behind. Hours later 
I've found nothing I want but the purple mache mask 
I made in the fourth grade. I like its yellow eyes. 
She looks at each magazine I remove, saving 
every word about my brother, the coach. He's sixty 
and a long dead mouse has eaten the laces 
of his baby shoes. I want order. I say 
I'm old myself, I've started throwing things away. 
I'm lying. I've kept everything she's ever given me.





In These Soft Trinities
 

Whenever I see two women 
       crowned, constellated friends 

it is as if three birch trees wept together 
       in a field by a constant spring. 

               The third woman isn't there 

exactly, but just before them a flame 
       bursts out, then disappears 

in a blurred, electric shining 
       that lifts my hair like an animal's. 

In an aura of charged air I remember 
         my poor mother turned into royalty, 
               my sister and me in bobby socks 

endlessly, all summer long 
       calling each other Margaret Rose 

and Lillibet, Lillibet, Lillibet, 
       pretending to be princesses... 

Now, swollen into these tall blooms 
       like paper cutouts in water, 

in each new neighborhood garden 
         always, two women talking 

nod their three curly heads together: 
       with bits of dirt on their foreheads, speckled 
               iris, flaming poppy 

in the backyard dynasties of the multiflora 
         it is the famous funeral photograph 
               of the Dowager Queen, Queen Mother, stunned Young Queen, 

three stepping stones in marble 
         that haunt me forever, clear 
                and mysterious as well water, the weight of it 

in a bronze bucket swinging 
                  powerfully from my hand. 

As the plumcolored shadow rises, 
          full as a first child in the orchard, 

the lost gardening glove on the path, 
                   the single earring tucked 

       in an odd corner of the purse and then found 

here double themselves, then triple: 
         in these soft trinities 
                  the lives that begin in us 

are born and born again like wings. 
       Secret as doves scuffling 

in the wide envelope of wombs 
                like loose, comfortable aprons flung 

over the heads of friends leaning together 
       in the hum of earth's plainsong 

like a three part round, 
       like a single voice murmuring 
                      the dream never leaves us, of the self 

like a three masted vessel still voyaging: 
            out of the long matrix of memory, 
                     the royal bulbs in the hold, 

the ballast that keeps us upright, loyal 
                to the dark, deep-bedded throne 
       of the old country each new soul claims as its own.





Song of the Round Man
 

(for Sarah when she's older)
The round and sad-eyed man puffed cigars as if 
he were alive. Gillyflowers 
to the left of the apple, purple bells to the right 

and a grass-covered hill behind. 
I am sad today said the sad-eyed man 
for I have locked my head in a Japanese box 

and lost the key. 
I am sad today he told me 
for there are gillyflowers by the apple 

and purple bells I cannot see. 
Will you look at them for me 
he asked, and tell me what you find? 

I cannot I replied 
for my eyes have grown sugary and dim 
from reading too long by candlelight. 

Tell me what you've read then 
said the round and sad-eyed man. 
I cannot I replied 

for my memory has grown tired and dim 
from looking at things that can't be seen 
by any kind of light 

and I've locked my head in a Japanese box 
and thrown away the key. 
Then I am you and you are me 

said the sad-eyed man as if alive. 
I'll write you in where I should be 
between the gillyflowers and the purple bells 

and the apple and the hill 
and we'll puff cigars from noon till night 
as if we were alive.





The Project of Linear Inquiry
 

[Let a be taken as . . .] 
a liquid line beneath the skin 
and b where the blue tiles meet 
body and the body's bridge 
a seeming road here, endless 

rain pearling light 
chamber after chamber 
of dust-weighted air 
the project of seeing things 
so to speak, or things seen 

namely a hand, namely 
the logic of the hand 
holding a bell or clouded lens 
the vase perched impossibly near the edge 
obscuring the metal tines. 

She said "perhaps then it echoed. 
I stood there torn 
felt hat in hand 
wondering what I had done 
to cause this dizziness 

"you must learn to live with. 
It reveals no identifiable source 
(not anyway the same as a forest floor). 
A vagrant march time, car 
passes silently, arm rests at his side 

holding a bell or ground lens 
where c stands for inessential night  
how that body would 
move vs how it actually does  
too abstract &/or not abstract enough 

but a closed curve in either case 
she might repeat 
indicating the shallow eaves 
nothing but coats and scarves below the window 
his-her face canted to the left 

nothing imagined or imaginable 
dark and nothing actually begun 
so that the color becomes exactly as it was 
in the miniuscule word for it 
scribbled beside an arrow 

on the far wall 
perfectly how else continuous with memory. 
There are pomegranates on the table 
though they have been placed there 
salt, pepper, books and schedules 

all sharing the same error 
and measure of inattention. 
What she says rolls forward. 
I shouted toward motion, other gestured, 
child laughs, sky, 

traffic, photograph. I 
gave a real pain, expelled 
breath, decided. Both arms in thought, 
mirror otherwise, abandoned 
structures mostly, the glass 

door with its inscription lay open 
before us, nothing to fear.





Prelude
 

The limit of the song is this 
prelude to a journey to 
the outer islands, the generative 
sentence, waltz project, forms, 
qualities, suns, moons, rings, 
an inside-outside then 
an outside-inside shaped 
with her colored clays. The days 
yet propse themselves 
as self-evident, everything there 
everything here 
and you are reading 
in a way natural to theatre 
a set of instructions 
that alters itself automatically 
as you proceed west 
from death to friendliness, the two 
topics upon which you are allowed 
to meditate 
under the first broad drops 
of rain. The planes 
will be piloted by ancestors 
who have come back to life. 
Why the delay.





Idem 1
 

(for two voices) 


   Let's see, how could you describe this to a listener? How can I describe this to our listeners? My head is in a steel vise I have been on a long voyage--a sea voyage--I have been travelling, sailing in a white ship, the weather is perfect surface of the water calm I am a woman or man over seven feet tall emerald green in color, malachite blue actually, tourmaline, carnelian, opal, I have been on a long voyage . . . 

   . . . while I have been open to desire. 

   Yes, while you have been open to desire, which is also blue. 

   I have been open to desire . . . 

   . . . which is like a storm or a small room . . . 

   . . . while you have been on a voyage, a sea voyage. You spoke of a white ship. 

   I did? 

   Yes, a white ship with twin masts. It sat in the water like a smile. 

   Oh right-like a smile, a white ship, gulls the first sign of land, then driftwood and kelp, then a harbor opens out before us in a perfect half-circle the water like they say clear as glass. She swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails and was a rest. I have been travelling. 

   You have been at sea in a white ship with your head in a steel vise. 

   Exactly correct . . . 

   . . . while I have been open to desire, my skin an attractive shade of blue, my voice calmly assertive. How can I describe this to a listener. The room is airy and bright, a bit cold in winter, there is a washstand with porcelain pitcher and bowl, a metal cot and a wood-burning stove that rarely works. I have a fine view of the river beyond the terracotta roofs. I assume it's understood that all of this is true. 

   Exactly correct. And at one point several days that is several minutes ago, didn't you mention a photograph or a painting, something hanging on the wall? 

   Her red hair, necklace of pearl and green dress. 

   Neckless of coral. 

   Necklace of coral, exactly correct . . . 

   . . . hanging on the wall opposite the bed. 

   Opposite the bed, yes. How can I describe it to our listeners. She is gazing out of the frame to her right or the viewer's left. Her expression is serious though not severe. What else? 

   Her arms . . . 

   . . . her arms hang at her sides. No-her left arm . . . her left arm . . . 

   She's sitting at a desk. 

   At her desk, yes, the desk is to the left of the door as you enter and the bed to the right. I'd forgotten the desk, where was I? 

   In a room overlooking a river and hills beyond covered with olive trees. And I? 

   On an ocean voyage. 

   An ocean voyage, yes, I have been travelling, my head in a kind of brace or cage, the surface calm, the light . . . 

   . . . very flat, so that it seems to open inward, this blueness is if I may call it that, buildings empty, hills almost liquid if there were hills. You spoke of a white ship, a cruising yawl' as I remember. 

   Yes, I have a description right here: 

          "Seen from the air this region of rivers winding their way through   
          flat country presents a pattern of arcs and meanderings of stagnant   
          water. The river-bed itself seems to be edged with pale curves, as if   
          nature had hesitated before giving the river its present, temporarily   
          course. At ground level, the Pantanal becomes a dream landscape,   
          where herds of zebus take refuge on the tops of hillocks which look   
          like floating arks, while in the flooded swamps flocks of large birds,   
          such as flamingos, egrest and herons, form dense white-and-pink is- 
          lands, less feathery however than the fan-like foliage of the caranda   
          palms, the leaves of which secrete a precious wax, and whose scat- 
          tered clumps offer the only interruption in the deceptively smiling 
          vistas of this aquatic desert. 

   You mean that's your idea of desire, with all those commas? 

   We lay becalmed for days, the sea wine-red, my head in a kind of brace or vise. I am a woman or man over seven feet tall, emerald green, crossing an endless field or meadow . . . 

   . . . hills almost liquid if there were hills . . . 

   . . . and the still air and intense heat of midday . . . 

   . . . forcing us to take shelter in the shade of the great cottonwoods by the river. 

   Yes, perfect, the great cottonwoods by the river.'   

   And to complete the picture a vast, cobbled public square dating from Roman times, an arcaded town hall decorated with frescoes, and a web of narrow streets filled with couples walking arm in arm. I am sitting in a cafe on the square, my left hand holding a copy of the Kansas City Star folded in half lengthwise, my right hand holding a spoon and idly stirring coffee in an oversized cup. And so on. The important spot over the head, irregular on one side, straight on the other, like the stripes of the dress, belongs more to her than to the wall; in balancing the head, this vertical form also helps to measure its tilt and the waviness of the hair and costume. On the right shoulder at the sleeve, the odd little puff continues the movement of the hair and accents the inclination of the head. The bands of the dress contribute a soft, wavering current of feeling channeled to the head and prolonged in the silhouette of the hair. 

   The flame-red hair. 

   No, dark brown, actually almost black, but I liked that business about the smiling vistas of the aquatic desert,' and the large flocks of birds.' Thought of using it myself. 

   Yes, the deceptively smiling vistas of this aquatic desert,' and all within the space of a small, sparcely furnished   room . . . 

   . . . overlooking the river. I would usually get up about noon, buy the daily paper and walks to one of the large cafes on the square for coffee and rolls . . . 

   . . . your face painted blue . . . 

   . . . and open to desire like a storm or small room, the air always heavy by the river, she raises both arms behind her head to unclasp the coral necklace. 

   Yes, the sun at its zenith, winged figure with arms extended, and a white ship, exactly correct. Let me tell you what it is you said. The lovers' limbs twist like a river. Their talk is a naming or being named. My back sometimes aches. Their talk hides in the telling. The wind moves us. Wands comes and cups, gardens, someone in a cloak, the wind moves us, laws, young girl and the bird at her wrist, colors, bright yellow or blue. I am a woman or man under green sky, garden to my right and then it's the following day. I am woman or man under emerald sky, wind brushes the river's surface, we talk until our talk becomes hidden. 

   And when does a play begin? 

   Don't you remember? 

   I remember trying to think of who to talk to and what to say. I remember trying to remember what happened on a given day, what word stood or what color, and where we had been and where we had gone. I remember the red studio and the woman in blue, and I remember the one who swallowed his tongue. 

   Do you remember all the listening? 

   I remember wandering completely lost and looking for the river. I remember hills and gilded domes . . . 

   . . . narrow streets between high buildings . . . 

   . . . narrow streets between high buildings . . . 

   . . . and the lists of irregular verbs . . . 

   . . . lists of irregular verbs. 

   To be is to be seen. 

   To be is to be seen. 

   Talk is a naming. 

   Talk is a naming or a being named . . . 

   . . . and desire an electric shade of blue . . . 

   . . . electric shade of blue. 

   Lovely weather today. 

   Lovely weather, clear and cold . . . 

   . . . with emerald sky . . . 

   . . . under emerald sky, rosemary and hyssop in bloom--uh--in bloom--uh--some marigolds--right, marigolds--clouds--probably clouds--things with--uh--names scattered about--uh--and so on------------just and so on.' 

   So you're the one who swallowed his tongue! 

   Now I remember--the play has begun!





To the Republic
 

Past 
fences the first sheepmen cast across the land, processions 
of cringing pitch or cedar posts pulling into the vanishing 
point like fretboards carrying barbed melodies, windharp 
narratives, songs of place, I'm thinking of the long cowboy 
ballads Ray taught me the beginnings of and would have taught   
me the ends if he could have remembered them. 
                                                                        But remembering 
was years ago when Ray swamped for ranches at a dollar a day 
and found, and played guitar in a Saturday night band, and now 
he is dead and I'm remembering near the end when he just needed 
a drink before he could tie his shoes. 
                                                      We'd stay up all night 
playing the beginnings of songs like Falling Leaf, about a 
girl who died of grief, and Zebra Dun, about a horse that 
pawed the light out of the moon. 
                                              Sometimes Ray would break 
through and recall a few more verses before he'd drop a line 
or scramble a rhyme or just go blank, and his workfat hands 
would drop the chords and fall away in disbelief. 
                                                                        Between 
songs he'd pull on the rum or unleash coughing fits that 
sounded like nails in a paper bag. 
                                                 Done, he'd straighten and 
say, My cough's not just right, I need another cigarette, and 
light the Parliament he bit at an upward angle like Roosevelt 
and play the start of another song. 
                                                   Then, played out and 
drunk enough to go home, he'd pick up his hat and case and 
make it, usually on the second try, through the front gate 
and gently list out into the early morning dark, beginning 
again some song without end, yodeling his vote under spangles.





I Looked for Life and Did a Shadow See
 

Some little splinter 
Of shadow purls 
And weals down 
The slewed stone 
Chapel steps, 
Slinks along 
The riverrock wall 
And disappears 
Into the light. 
Now ropy, riffled, 
Now owlish, sere, 
It smolders back 
To sight beneath 
A dwarfish, brindled tree 
That chimes and sifts 
And resurrects 
In something's sweet 
And lethal breath. 
This little shadow 
Seems to know 
(How can it know? 
How can it not?) 
Just when to flinch 
Just where to loop and sag 
And skitter down, 
Just what to squirrel 
And what to squander till 
The light it lacks 
Bleeds it back 
And finds 
My sleeping dark-haired girl -- 
O personal, 
Impersonal, 
Continual thrall -- 
And hammocks blue 
In the hollows of her eyes.





You Know What People Say
 

Sulky what-ifs. 
Sulky what-ifs. 
They bumblefuck the metastuff. 
Diffidence their stock in trade. 
Cozy hell -- cozy, hell. 
They make a mockery of irony. 
They hold Special Olympics in wit. 
What was Shakespeare's blood pressure? 
Vertical river, cloister of thunder, 
Bleeds the ship's fell sail. 
God comes in for a landing. He lowers God's landing gear. 
He raises holy spoilers, lowers the sacred ailerons. He imagines 
Reality. 
Tried everything in life? 
Sulky what-ifs are dumbstruck. Drumsticks. 
Their spiritual actuality is empirical. 
What if uppity angels? 
What if there really were rules? 
What if those angels melted in the rain? 
If reality is an illusion, wouldn't it stand to reason 
That illusions are real? 
A lot of dumb questions. 
Impingement of external objects or conditions upon the body 
Palpitate apostasy. 
The oppressed must free the oppressors to free themselves, see? 
The soul is euphemism for the body. 
What does willing mean? Do you sense my sense? 
Am I fashionable? 
Objective as an angel in the rain? 
Screaming from a safe place? 
Nine smocked doctors, three unmasked. 
One has left his face sewn to the pillow. 
One holds a lace fan like a hand of cards she studies, 
Considering the risks. 
She is the loveliest doctor. 
Her doctor-father scolds her right there in front of all the other doctors. 
They are aghast. 
They kneel and don carnival hats with feathers. 
I don't think they are really doctors. 
The trees are real. They are green kachinas. 
Dark rooms of wind are installed in the house of barbarism. 
The norm is always incorrect. If what?





Western Civilization
 

for William Kittredge
1. 

That woman still lives at her ranch. 
You can ask her. Maybe 
She knows. As near and far 

As the rest of us can tell 
The barn and sheds were built 
In the Great Depression. Someone 

Had money and a big idea. 
Far and away the biggest 
Idea I've ever seen. 

Pat says there must've been 
A hundred men, shepherds 
And shearers, working there. 

It's one of those things 
That not only is, but seems, 
Larger inside than out, 

Like a planetarium or an orange, 
Even with Wyoming around it, 
And real stars flying away. 

Just stick your head in there; 
Its dark will make you dizzy. 
It has an underneath 

Too low to stand in unless 
You are a sheep. The loft 
Vaults like a dusky church. 


    2. 

All that summer 
I balanced water, 

Coaxing the desert 
Into pasture, 

With eight cubic feet 
Per second for two 

Thousand acres. 
Horseback, shovel 

On my shoulder along 
Miles of ditches: 

Stalling here, 
Releasing there, 

Water over 
The deepening green, 

Keeping it living: 
Herons and cranes 

Regal in meadows, 
Strings of ducklings 

Frothing the ditch 
To get away. 


    3. 

One day riding ditches I saw Clay. 
He was on the hill against the sky, 
Flapping his arms at me. 
They were going to bulldoze the corrals at the shearing sheds, 
Intricate maze of gates and pens 
Clay, as a kid, had built with his father, 
Before they lost their ranch, before Frank died, 
Before the family had to move away. 

The new owner was razing everything. 
I guess he had some kind of idea. 
Clay didn't need any gates, but, as Pat said, 
That's Clay. 
I met them at the shearing sheds. 
Pat held a wrecking bar like a steel snake. 
I just can't stand tearin' apart all them guys's dreams, 
he said, looking shy. 
Hell is when you know where you are. 


    4. 

On the barn roof a loose piece of tin 
Flaps in the wind like a broken wing. 
Wyoming whirls in the sun. 

Up in the loft a pair of shears, 
Oh, fifty or sixty years forgotten there, 

Floats in noonlight, bearing up some dust, 
Just a pair of spring-steel scissors, 
Two knives joined at the hip, with smiling edges. 

An owl the color of things left alone 
Flaps out of the gable door. 

Hell is when you know where you are: 
Mazes of pens and gates dreaming sheep; 
Miles of ditches dreaming green. 


    5. 

No one living knows 
Who built the shearing sheds, 
Unless maybe that woman, 
And I'm not about to ask her, 
Ever since she tried 
To stab her husband with a pair of scissors. 
He was ninety-one 
And barely held her off. 
Later she claimed she was just 
Trying to cut his heart 
Medication out of his shirt 
Pocket -- dope, she called it -- 
And the old man had to leave 
The ranch, where he didn't last long. 

They bulldozed the corrals. 
We got forty gates. 
We took them someplace safe. 


    6. 

Now the vast, dim barn floats like an ocean liner 
Whose doldrums are meadows spinning into brush, 
And everywhere you look Wyoming hurries off. 

All night the stars make their escape. 
In the loft a pair of shears cuts woolly moonlight. 
All day a piece of roofing slaps in the wind. 

A startled owl flaps out of the gable. 
Hell is when you know where you are and it's beautiful. 
You saved the gates for nothing. 

You balanced the water to keep the green from spinning 
Away into sage, the same gray as the wing 
That just now shaded your eyes.





Letter 7
 

But the buried walls and our mouths of fragments, 
no us but the snow staring at us . . . 

And you Mr. Ground-of_what, Mr. Text, Mr. Is-Was, 
can you calculate the ratio between wire and window, 

between tone and row, copula and carnival 
and can you reassemble light from the future-past 

in its parabolic nest 
or recite an entire winter's words, 

its liberties and psuedo-elegies, 
the shell of a street-car in mid-turn 

or scattered fires in the great hall 
I would say not-I here I'd say The Book of Knots 

I'd say undertows and currents and waterspouts, 
streaks of phosphorus and rivervine winds 

Dear Z, I'd say it's time, it's nearly time, it's almost, it's 
       just about, it's long 
past time now time now for the vex- for the vox- for the 
       voices of shadows, 

time for the prism letters, trinkets and shrouds, 
for a whirl in gauzy scarves around the wrecked piazza 

Messieurs-Dames, Meine Herren und Damen, our word-ballon, 
       you will note, is slowly 
rising over the parched city, 

its catacombs, hospitals and experimental gardens, 
its toll-gates, ghettos and ring-roads, 

narcoleptics and therapists and stray cats 
Ladies and Gentleen, our menu for this flight, 

due to temporary shortages, 
will be an alpha-omega soup, Bactrian hump, and nun's farts 

As we enter the seventh sphere, you will discover a thin 
layer of ice just beginning 

to form on your limbs 
Do not be alarmed, this is normal 

You will experience difficulty breathing, this is normal 
The breathing you experience is difficulty, this is normal 

Dear Z, Should I say space 
constructed of echoes, rifts, mirrors, a strange 

year for touring the interior 
Should I say double dance, Horn, axis and wheel 

Dear A, Scuttled ships are clogging the harbors 
and their cargoes lie rotting on the piers 

Prepare executions and transfusions 
Put on your latest gear





Rintrah Roars
 

for John Grant
My father-in-law writes from Umbria (where peasants eat songbirds 
for lunch and pray beneath frescoes by Giotto): Saturday, 30 Jan. (last 
day of the season wherein big men can kill little birds). 

Lyndon Johnson, while being escorted by a young Marine who said, 
"That one over there is your helicopter, Sir, replied, placing his arm 
around the boy, "Son, they're all my helicopters.   

Sam said, "I might be white bread, but there is one pissed-off nigger in   
my heart. 

McPherson says he doesn't see anything in the world worth coming 
back for. He wants to get off the wheel, says, "I don't want to come 
back as anything -- not even a bumblebee.   

So I say, "Oh, Jim, you'd make a good bumblebee, but I was thinking: 
That should be enough for anybody's God. 

It would be trite to describe the clocksmith's house -- the way it 
sounded like bees in there. "You can never have enough clocks in your 
house. This from a man who had thousands in his. I asked, "You 
probably don't even hear them anymore. He said, "I hear them when 
they stop. 

Lyle said, "It's all right to be a fool; it's just not all right to be a old 
fool. 

Steve, the banjo wasn't all they smashed. It was every window. It was 
every thing I had. You don't want to feel the wind blow through your 
house that way. 

Another friend said, "I am chained to the earth to pay for the freedom 
of my eyes.





Stories Are Made of Mistakes
 

1. 

Even the pole bean tendrils sought out and gripped their 
frames within six hours of my setting them. 
                                                               One of the things 
that is breaking my heart is that I can't trust language to 
express any thanks. 
                            My pole beans, my honeybees, my coyotes, 
my dog, all my good horses. 

    2. 

The black mare I shouldn't have bought and bought, and once 
I had, should have shipped, bucked me, too, the first time 
I got up. 
            But God she was a beauty. 
                                                 I thought if I just rode her 
I could ride her down. 
                               Her name was Sara and we kept it at that. 

All she wanted to do was run. 
                                          Ears back, flat out, nose pushed 
into the next life. 
                         I wanted her to learn to walk. 

    3. 

After about a year of chop I turned her uphill on a good gravel 
road and said, "OK, you bitch, you want to run? 
                                                                      I let go 
her head and gave her the steel. 
                                                I'd never been on a horse so 
fast. 
      I've never been on one since. 
                                                So fast you couldn't 
count the beats in the rhythm of her gait. 
                                                             Suicidal. 
                                                                         But when, 
after some miles, she started to flag, I said, "I thought you 
wanted to run, and dug her out again. 

    4. 

The pole bean tendrils sought their frames within six hours 
of my setting them. 
                           They broke my heart. 
                                                            They gripped. 

    5. 

A patch of sunlight mottled the shade. 
                                                       Whether she never 
saw the root that snaked through the shadow or was just too 
far in front of herself, I'll never know. 
                                                      She stumbled 
and fell. 
            First on her knees then over. 
                                                      We rasped together 
down the gravel road, black mare on top of me. 
                                                                     We rasped 
to a halt. 
             She jumped to her feet. 
                                                She stared at me. 
                                                                      I 
could see the bone in both her knees. 
                                                      Ribbons of hide hanging. 

Blood like volunteer firemen beginning to rise to the occasion. 

    6. 

Ten years later, today, I'm riding her. 
                                                       I keep her reined 
in most of the time. 
                            She tosses her head, snaps tie-downs. 

She dances and whirls, doubles under and rears incessantly. 

She makes me the butt of ridicule: 
                                                 "So, uh, Jim, how old 
is that mare? 
                     "She must be twenty now. 
                                                             "Don't you think 
it's time she was broke? 
                                    Every once in a while I let her 
run and break my heart. 
                                    Anyone watching stops breathing. 

    7. 

If I ever get to heaven and know who I am, I'd like to over- 
hear my daughter tell a story to her children. 
                                                                  "Sometimes 
my dad used to ride this black mare...





continental divide
 

had no direction to go but up: and this, the shattery road 
its surface graining, trickle in late thaw--is nothing amiss? 
            --this melt, the sign assures us, natural cycle 
                         and whoosh, the water a dream of forgotten white 

past aspens colored in sulfur, they trembled, would 
--poor sinners in redemption song--shed their tainted leaves 



I tell you what boy I was, writing lyrics to reflect my passions: 
the smell of a bare neck in summer 
a thin trail of hairs disappearing below the top button of cut-offs 
the lean, arched back of a cyclist straining to ascend a hill 

in the starlight I wandered: streets no better than fields 
the cul-de-sacs of suburbia just as treacherous, just as empty 

if wood doves sang in the branches of the acacias, I could not hear them 
anyone lost in that same night was lost in another tract 

the air pulsed and dandelion pollen blew from green stalks 
                        --that was all 



and yes, someone took me in his car.   and another against the low fence 
in the park at the end of our block.   under the willow branches 
where gnats made a furious cloud at dawn and chased us away 

I knew how it felt to lie in a patch of marigolds: golden stains 
the way morning swarmed a hidden rooftop, the catbirds singing 
the feel of ruin upon lips rubbed raw throughout the night 

granite peaks: here, the earth has asserted itself. and the ice asserted 
and human intimacies conspired to keep us low and apart 

for an ice age I knew you only as an idea of longing: 
a voice in the next yard, whispering through the chink 
a vagabond outlined against the sky, among the drying grass 



we journey this day to darkness: the chasm walls lift us on their scaly backs 
the glaciers relinquish their secrets: that sound is the ice bowing 
and the sound underneath, the trickle: the past released, disappearing 



you pinnacle of my life, stand with me on this brink 
half-clouded basin caked in flat grays, the very demise of green 

you have surmounted the craggy boundary between us. 



you open a place for me in earth, receiving my song

A Poets Death
 

Rachel Sherwood 1954-1979  "What can you say about a twenty-five-year-old girl who died?" --Erich Segal, Love Story
The first time we talked was in the rooftop 
cafeteria at Cal State Northridge. 
Misplaced poets, we sat amidst a crop 
of clean-cut freshmen while, round the college, 
smog-smudged San Fernando Valley beckoned, 
panoramic and bland. I'd just returned 
from my debauched year up north--sad, drunken 
sex at the baths, in dark parks. You still yearned 
for St. David's, your stint as a foreign 
exchange student. In Wales, something fearless 
woke you up: you drank, wrote, fucked. Now, stuck in 
the suburbs, we talked poets, punk rock. This 
was the late seventies, disco's zenith. 
We both wanted to look like Patti Smith. 

We both wanted to look like Patti Smith 
on her Horses album: disheveled, pale, 
thin, intense. You were scanning Meredith's 
"Modern Love for British Lit. I thought stale 
anyone before Sexton. You laughed, threw 
back your head. I puffed a Marlboro Light. 
In truth, you were too hearty, and I too 
uptight, to do punk. I praised, as twilight 
dimmed the gray valley, a poem you'd read 
at the student reading: a pitcher cracks, 
foreshadows a car crash. The skyline bled 
behind you. I'd also read that night--racked 
with stage fright, trembling uncontrollably. 
You seemed at ease, more confident than me. 

You seemed at ease, more confident than me, 
more independent. Lived on Amigo 
Avenue with a roommate, a moody 
science major; and your alter ego, 
a tomcat named Baby Tubbs. Still at home, 
I had no wheels. You drove a battered white 
hatchback full of newspapers, beer cans, comb, 
brush, books--half wastebasket, half purse. One night 
early on, we split a fifth of scotch, spread 
your tarot cards on the living room floor. 
You predicted long life for me, then said 
of yourself: "I might make twenty-five. Your 
roommate walked by, shot a look. Later, I 
passed out beneath Lord Byron's watchful eye. 

Passed out beneath Lord Byron's watchful eye-- 
the poster tacked above your secondhand 
couch--I dreamt I was falling down the side 
of a mountain, a scarecrow, twisted and 
limp, limbs ripped, bouncing from rock to rock. On 
every wall an idol: Toulouse-Lautrec 
cancan in kitchen, young Chatterton's wan 
figure over your desk. Shuffling the deck, 
you asked the same question, drew the same black 
card: Death. Together we consulted all 
your oracles: Ouija board, zodiac, 
I Ching, palm, a fickle Magic 8 Ball. 
Hoping for more time, you inquired, believed 
like a convict praying for a reprieve. 

Like a convict praying for a reprieve, 
you were more alive than the complacent 
suburbanites I despised. Drunk and peeved 
at the world, I started an argument 
that ended with you hurling a full Coors 
at me as I fumed down your stairs. Four weeks 
passed before we spoke, a rift I endured 
by writing a poem about the freak- 
ish night a black cloud followed us--we lit 
candles, toasted oblivion. Battle 
scarred, we entered the undergraduate 
poetry contest at Northridge. Daniel 
Halpern guest judged...or was it May Swenson? 
After your death, I'd be happy you won. 

What can you say about a twenty-five- 
year-old girl who died? That as a child she 
loved horses. And dogs. And cats. That Monty 
Python made her laugh. That she was alive 
to the disruptions of her time. That she 
liked Byron, Rod Stewart, Mozart, Waugh, Poe, 
Keats, the Cars. That she lived on Amigo 
and was my friend. That she once threw her keys 
in anger; once threw a New Yorker, shout- 
ing "I hate John Ashbery! And that she 
once, after a speed- and scotch-fueled orgy-- 
Some Girls blasting, her last boyfriend passed out 
beside us--straddled, rode me like a horse. 
Rachel, can I say this: your cunt felt coarse. 

After your death, I'd be happy you won 
the contest--at least you had that. "Don't turn 
on me, you pleaded. Losing wasn't fun, 
but I couldn't begrudge you your prize. Burned 
out from an abortion, a vicious bite-- 
a German shepherd lunged at your nose, slit 
its tip--and a violent unrequit- 
ed affair with your "Don J, a closet 
case obsessed with Kerouac, you spoke of 
making a change. By then it was summer: 
Blondie on the car radio, Fourth of 
July, craving fireworks. I remember 
headlights; reaching for the steering wheel, you. 
Next thing I knew, I woke in ICU.   

Next thing I knew, I woke in ICU: 
machines beeping around me, doctors and 
nurses hovering in an eerie blue 
light. Tube down my throat, I scrawled, with bruised hand, 
your name, question mark. My sister was steered 
in, wept to tell you were dead. The night they 
moved me to a private room, you appeared, 
pulsating white presence, in the hallway 
outside my door. "I'm all right, you said, "You 
don't have to worry about me. I'd lie 
there in traction for six weeks, almost two 
decades ago, a ghost that fell from my 
own scarecrow dream, numb to that deadly drop. 
The first time we talked was on a rooftop.





To Arielle and the Moon
 

The night reduced to a siren, a sigh: 

Beautiful boy on the treadmill 

Glimpsed sweating through sweating glass-- 

My new moon. 

Sylvia's moon: a smiling skull 

Snagged in witchy branches; fossil 

Brushed free of blackest earth. 

My last moon: an orange ball at rest, for an instant, 

On the grey lake. 

Wish list: dining set and dresser, 

Boombox, thin black tie, boy- 

Friend  la Madonna's "True Blue 

La la la la la la la 

Your moon (tonight): a clouded X-ray. 

I stand at a corner and stare up, 

Both of us astonished 

By its own secret light.

It's fun to learn your ABC's. 
I'm Chatty Cathy, who are you? 

Please come help me tie my shoe. 
Can you come out and play with me? 
When you grow up, what will you do? 

The rooster says cock-a-doodle-doo. 
Please read me a bedtime story.

Red Parade
 

Depressed because my 
book wasn't nominated 
for a gay award, 

I lie on my couch 
watching--not listening to-- 
the O.J. trial. 

Byron, who senses 
something's wrong, hides under the 
bed until Ira 

comes home, carrying 
a bouquet of beautifully 
wrapped tulips. I press 

the mute button. "This 
is your prize, he says. "Guess what 
they're called. A smile in- 

voluntarily 
overcomes my frown. "What? "Red 
Parade. "That sounds like 

the name of an old 
Barbie outfit, I say. "That's 
exactly what I 

told the florist. And 
you know what she told me? "What? 
"When she was a girl, 

she turned her Barbie 
into Cleopatra: gave 
her an Egyptian 

haircut and painted 
her nipples blue. "How cool. "Yeah, 
but now she thinks that 

her doll would be worth 
eight hundred dollars if she 
hadn't messed it up. 

Once in water, the 
tulips begin to unclench-- 
ten angry fists. Their 

colors are fierce, like 
Plath's "great African cat, her 
"bowl of red blooms. Poor 

Sylvia, who so 
desperately wanted awards, 
and only won them 

after she was dead. 
Byron jumps up, Ira sits 
down and massages 

my feet. "You guys. My 
spirits are lifted by their 
tulips, kisses, licks.





For Edwin Wilson
 

Did wind and wave design the albatross's wing, 
honed compliances: or is it effrontery to 
suggest that the wing designed the gales and 

seas: are we guests here, then, with all the 
gratitude and soft-walking of the guest: 
provisions and endurances of riverbeds, 

mountain shoulders, windings through of tulip 
poplar, grass, and sweet-frosted foxgrape: 
are we to come into these and leave them as 

they are: are the rivers in us, and the slopes, 
ours that the world's imitate, or are we 
mirrorments merely of a high designing aloof 

and generous as a host to us: what would 
become of us if we declined and staked out 
a level affirmation of our own: we wind 

the brook into our settlement and husband the 
wind to our sails and blades: what is to 
be grateful when let alone to itself, as for 

a holiday in naturalness: the albatross, ah, 
fishes the waves with a will beyond the 
waves' will, and we, to our own doings, put 

down the rising of sea or mountain slope: except 
we do not finally put it down: still, till 
the host appears, we'll make the masters here.





For Emily Wilson
 

Such a long time as the wave idling gathers 
lofts and presses forward into the curvature 
of the height before one realizes that the 

tension completes itself with a fall through air, 
disorganization the prelude to the meandering 
of another gather and hurl, the necessary: 

ah, what can one make to absorb the astonishment: 
you should have seen me the merchant at market 
this morning: the people ogled me with severe 

goggles: maids, buying in manners and measures 
beyond themselves, stared into my goods and 
then grew horror-eyed: wives still as distant 

from day as a carrot from dinner took the 
misconnection sagely, a usual patience: 
peashells, I said, long silky peashells: cobs, 

I said, long cobs: husks and shucks, I said: 
one concerned person pointed out that my whole 
economy was wrong; yes, I said, but I have 

nothing else to sell: and I said to her, won't 
you appreciate the silky beds where seeds 
have lain: she had not come to that: and 

how about this residence all the grains have 
left: won't you buy it and think about it: 
not for dinner, she said: rinds, I cried, 

rinds and peelings: there was some interest 
in those, as for a marmalade, but no one willing, 
finally, to do the preparations: absurd, one 

woman shouted, and then I grew serious: can you 
do with that: but she was off before we fully 
met: you should have seen me the merchant at 

market this morning: will bankruptcy make a 
go of it: will the leavings be left only: the 
wave turns over and does not rise again, that wave.





Written on the eve of my 20th high school reunion, which I was not able to attend
 

For the Briarcliff High School class of 1986
Just what I needed, 
Just when the dreams had almost totally receded, 

The dreams of roles for which I learned no lines and knew no cues, 
Dreams of pop quizzes with no pants on and no shoes, 

Just when I understood I was no longer among 
Those ephemeral immortals, the gauche and pitiable young, 

Suddenly come phone calls, messages sift out of the air 
To ask who will be there: 

Names I haven't given a thought to in a score 
(A score!) of years, and names I used to think about but don't much anymore, 

And those I think of all the time and yet 
Have lost somehow like keys to doors I've closed, and some I have tried to forget-- 

And some who will never arrive at this date 
Here in the distant future where we wait 

Still surprised at how 
We carry with us the omnipresent and ever-changing now. 

We wince at what we used to wear, 
Fashion has made ridiculous the high hubris of our hair. 

Heartbreak, looked at through the wrong end of distance's glasses, 
Is trivial, and quickly passes, 

Its purity embarrasses us, its lust, 
The way we wept because it was unjust. 

Why should we travel back, who've come so far-- 
We know who we are. 

How can we be the same 
As those quaint ancestors we have left behind, who share our name-- 

Why have we inherited their shame?





Two Violins
 

One was fire red,   
Hand carved and new-- 
The local maker pried the wood 
From a torn-down church's pew, 

The Devil's instrument 
Wrenched from the house of God. 
It answered merrily and clear 
Though my fingering was flawed; 

Bright and sharp as a young wine, 
They said, but it would mellow, 
And that I would grow into it. 
The other one was yellow 

And nicked down at the chin, 
A varnish of Baltic amber, 
A one-piece back of tiger maple 
And a low, dark timbre. 

A century old, they said, 
Its sound will never change. 
Rich and deep on G and D, 
Thin on the upper range, 

And how it came from the Old World 
Was anybody's guess-- 
Light as an exile's suitcase, 
A belly of emptiness: 

That was the one I chose 
(Not the one of flame)   
And teachers would turn in their practiced hands 
To see whence the sad notes came.





Sublunary
 

Mid-sentence, we remembered the eclipse, 
Arguing home through our scant patch of park 
Still warm with barrel wine, when none too soon 
We checked the hour by glancing at the moon, 
Unphased at first by that old ruined marble 
Looming like a monument over the hill, 
So brimmed with light it seemed about to spill, 

Then, there! We watched the thin edge disappear-- 
The obvious stole over us like awe, 
That it was our own silhouette we saw, 
Slow perhaps to us moon-gazing here 
(Reaching for each other's fingertips) 
But sweeping like a wing across that stark 
Alien surface at the speed of dark. 

The crickets stirred from winter sleep to warble 
Something out of time, confused and brief, 
The roosting birds sang out in disbelief, 
The neighborhood's stray dogs began to bark. 
And then the moon was gone, and in its place, 
A dim red planet hung just out of reach, 
As real as a bitter orange or ripened peach 

In the penumbra of a tree. At last 
We rose and strolled at a reflective pace 
Past the taverna crammed with light and smoke 
And people drinking, laughing at a joke, 
Unaware that anything had passed 
Outside in the night where we delayed 
Sheltering in the shadow we had made.





It includes the butterfly and the rat, the shit
 

It includes the butterfly and the rat, the shit   
drying to chalk, trees   
falling at an angle, taking those moist   
and buried rootballs with them   

into deadly air. But someone will   
tell you the butterfly's the happy ending   
of every dirge-singing worm, the rat   
a river rat come up from a shimmering depth,   

the shit passed purely into scat one can read   
for a source, the creature that shadowed it one   
longish minute. And trees, of course they   
wanted to fall. It was their time or something   

equally sonorous. And wind too knows its   
mindless little whirlpool's not for nothing, not   
nothing--that pitch and rage stopped. How else   
does the sparrow's neck break.





Birdsong, face it, some male machine
 

Birdsong, face it, some male machine   
gone addled--repeat, repeat--the damage 
keeps doing, the world ending then starting, 
the first word the last, etc. It's that   

etcetera. How to love. Is a wire   
just loose? Build an ear for that. Fewer, they say.   
So many fewer, by far. He's showing off   
to call her back. Or claiming the tree.   

Or a complaint--the food around here,   
the ants, the moths, the berries. She's making   
the nest, or both are. In feathers, in hair or twigs,   
in rootlets and tin foil. Shiny bits seen 

from a distance, a mistake. But fate   
has reasons to dress up. Stupid   
and dazzling have a place, a place, a place   
though never. She can't sing it.





The Approaches
 

A childless, futureless road 
And then nothing. . . Is that it? 
Or start believing in a God 
Beyond the temporal limit 

Of westering skies, wide, melancholy, 
Uncut fields and paced-out walls 
As we drive towards it slowly, 
The house that has us both in thrall. 

They are gone, now, the hours of light 
It took to get here. Might-have-beens, 
Lost wanderyears. But that's alright-- 
We are trading it in, the seen 

For the experienced, the car keys 
For the end of the journey, 
When distances have lost their power 
And the heart beats slower 

In tomorrow's cold, a coming weather 
One degree north of yesterday. 
High latitudes--as they say, 
There is nothing up here 

But wind and silence, passing clouds, 
Light diminished half a tone, 
A dish left out all night for the gods 
By morning turned to stone. 

So take a right, go down two gears 
And stay in second, where the church is 
And the pig farm. Only the approaches 
Are terrible, only the years, 

The getting here, which takes forever. 
A boy in tears, a barren crone 
On a bicycle, a man alone-- 
They're waving. . . It's now or never 

For the final self, I assume-- 
For the shape of the house 
On the skyline, the release 
Into childhood, and the coming home.





An Aubade
 

She said what about San Francisco? Another 
second chance. There would be bridges "shrouded 
in fog." Streets "pregnant and glowing" with traffic. 
Dawn, she didn't know, would maybe "draw near." 
He said dawn draws near everywhere. She said 
a city but a city close to nature. A backyard 
scattered with birds he wouldn't be able to identify 
and something exotic rotting. Avocadoes. 
They'd play a game on the bridge, she'd lose 
control of the car, he'd kick her foot away 
and mash the gas pedal to the floor until she 
screamed and they'd have a name for the game 
and later it would be a story for their kids if 
they had any kids later. But no city is close to nature. 
Her body is a white slash beneath the green sheet. 
Or "a sterilized instrument." Last night's wine dregs 
are both "the color of the valley as it ignites" 
and in fact that color. He pulls the sheets from her 
again and says he'll cut their coffins from 
a wazi'hcaka even if it leaves a gray jay homeless. 
The lumber's astringency. Fuck guacamole. 
Deep in her knots and sap. Faster and faster. Second 
nature. And now a different dawn drawing near.





The Consultant for the Mayor
 

You can never tell 
By the looks of a frog 
How high it can leap, 
Said her Auntie Ott. 
Haley's hair flips up and down 
As she moves in her hard shoes, 
Her leather coat for winter 
Is lengthy and sways, some stains 
Mottling the bottom-- 

Elegant windows in decline 
That at one time 
One could climb through, 
French imitation 
Nailed shut for decades. In shadow 
Pigeons peck in dirty snow 
Massed against the closest wall. 
What her hair will look like someday, 
She surmises. But otherwise 
Isn't troubled by the future. 
Don't walk like a duck, 
Men don't like it, said Auntie Ott. 
Not necessarily, responded her grandmother, 
As she brushed a crumb onto a saucer-- 
Playing cards, stories of earlier poverty. 
As a girl she pretended 
To be as worried as they 
Whether Bobby would be drafted 
And killed in the war. 
Maybe she's important in art 
Or decoration, supposes the student 
Adjusting his pack-- 
As the light changes, he steps out 
But she banks around the corner 
Behind him, purseless, gloveless, 
Passing a restaurant, a coin store, 
A key shop--owners staring over the street 
Wishing they were younger. 
Or lived in an earlier time. 
Which is partly the fault 
Of late winter. Clittering ice 
In trees of Veteran's Park. . . 
Lightly swinging her arms now, 
Heading uphill, growing distant, 
Like a figure studied 
In Auntie Ott's Utrillo print-- 
Stick-like, scarecrow-like-- 
To her right, a converted house 
Looking vaguely like a shrunken 
Monticello. . . Cream-colored barriers 
Of plowed snow as sun sprays 
More volume. . . A moment of deception 

There's not much that can be done, 
Said the city, when the oaks 
Were removed for curb repair. 
The dome fell off the theatre. 
A policeman peering east, frozen. 
Just as the museum is shuttered 
Next to the blank bowling alley 
(which is our other perspective). 
Haley has never felt trapped, 
Though the possibilities, occasionally, 
Have skirted about like sparrows. 
A jet crosses the sky. 
Followed by its vibration. 
What she found sustaining 
She learned in college. 
Where she goes is no one's business 
Either. 
Neither is she worshipped 
And adored--Auntie Ott 
Would be dismayed. 
Though not entirely





My Life as a Subject
 

I 

Because I was born in a kingdom, 
there was a king. At times 
the king was a despot; at other times, 
not. Axes flashed in the road 

at night, but if you closed your eyes 
and sang the old ballads 
sitting on the well edge 
amongst your kinspeople 
then the silver did not appear 
to be broken.    

Such were the circumstances. 
They made a liar out of me. 
Did they change my spirit?   
Kith in the night   
the sound of owls. A bird fight. 

II 

We also had a queen, 
whetted by the moon. And 
we her subjects, 
softening in her sight. 

III 

What one had   
the other had to 
have too. Soon   
parrots bloomed 
in every garden, and   
every daughter 
had a tuning fork   
jeweled with emeralds. 

IV 

Learning to hunt in the new empire, 
the king invited his subjects 
to send him their knives. 
He tested these knives on oranges, 
pomegranates, acorn squash, 
soft birches, stillborns, prisoners 
who had broken rules. He used them 
on the teeth of traitors. 

V 

When strangers massed at the borders, 
the courtiers practiced   
subjection of the foreign. The court   
held a procession   
of twine, rope, 
gold, knife, light, and 
prostitutes with their vials of white 
powder. Smoke coursed into the courtyard, 
and we wrought hunger upon 
the bodies of strangers. I am sure you 
can imagine 
it, really what need   
is there for me to tell you? 
You were a stranger once too, and I 
brought rope. 

VI 

Afterward, I always slept, 
and let the dealers   
come to me alone 
with jewels. 

VII   

In the court at night, we debated 
the skin of language, 
questioned what might 
one day be revealed inside: 
a pink and soft fruit, 
a woman in a field. . . 
Or a shadow, sticky and loose 
as old jam. Our own   
dialect was abstract, 
we wished to understand 
not how things were 
but what spectacle we might   
make from them. 

VIII 

One day a merchant 
brought moving pictures,   
the emperor's new delight.   
He tacked dark cloth to all   
the windows, top   
and bottom, and turned 
the lights off, cranking the machine like 
a needle and thread 
making forms into which 
we could insinuate our cold 
bodies and find warmth. Light; dark. 
And the sliding images of courtiers 
merrily balancing pineapples 
on their heads, as if this   
were an adequate story. 

IX 

And our queen, that hidden 
self. What became 
of her? Slid into the night 
like a statue, and felt 
around into shadows, 
nothing to prove, all worldly 
latitudes, knowing as a spider 
in retreat. The web 
her mind, and in it, the fly. 

X 

On Sundays, we flew kites   
to ensure our joy 
was seen by all those who   
threatened 
to threaten us. The thread 
spooling out up high   
in the purple sky 
and silver gelatin films being made, 
sliding through the cranking machine 
so that the barbarians could know 
we made images of ourselves 
coated in precious metal 
and sent them away 
indifferent to our wealth. 

I miss the citrus   
smell of spring 
on the plaza filled 
with young 
and long-limbed kite flyers. 

XI 

Do I have anything else 
to add? Only that 
I obeyed my king, my 
kind, I was not faithless. 
Should I be punished 
for that? It is true   
some of my pictures creak unhappily 
through the spindle. 
It is true one day they 
came to my house. I know   
the powder we coated our fingers 
with made us thirsty 
and sometimes cruel. But I was born 
with a spirit like you. 
I have woken, you see, 
and I wish to be   
made new.





On Marriage
 

Stone by stone, body by body in the grass: 
For this we trade our lone compass, 

Become swans instead, adrift in glaze- 
Light, kilned in the arms of each other 

Into vessel-vassal new. Or shrew, 
As the case may be. What would you do?   

Listen to the footsteps in the thistles. 
Put the kettle on for tea, and whisper it to me.





republic
 

soon, industry and agriculture converged 
                        and the combustion engine 
sowed the dirtclod truck farms green   
                                  with onion tops and chicory 

mowed the hay, fed the swine and mutton   
                      through belts and chutes 

cleared the blue oak and the chaparral 
                                    chipping the wood for mulch 

back-filled the marshes 
                        replacing buckbean with dent corn   

removed the unsavory foliage of quag 
                                 made the land into a production 
made it produce, pistoned and oiled 
                              and forged against its own nature 


and--with enterprise--built silos 
                            stockyards, warehouses, processing plants 
abattoirs, walk-in refrigerators, canneries, mills 
                                                                & centers of distribution   

it meant something--in spite of machinery-- 
                      to say the country, to say apple season 
though what it meant was a kind of nose-thumbing   
                                           and a kind of sweetness 
                      as when one says how quaint 
knowing that a refined listener understands the doubleness 


and the leveling of the land, enduing it in sameness, cured malaria 
as the standing water in low glades disappeared, 
                                                       as the muskegs drained                               
typhoid and yellow fever decreased 
                                  even milksickness abated 
thanks to the rise of the feeding pen 
                         cattle no longer grazing on white snakeroot 

vanquished:    the germs that bedeviled the rural areas 
                                                       the rural areas also 
vanquished:    made monochromatic and mechanized, made suburban 


now,   
the illnesses we contract are chronic illnesses:    dyspepsia, arthritis 
            heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, asthma 
                           chronic pain, allergies, anxiety, emphysema 
                                       diabetes, cirrhosis, lyme disease, aids 
            chronic fatigue syndrome, malnutrition, morbid obesity   
hypertension, cancers of the various kinds:    bladder bone eye lymph   
                     mouth ovary thyroid liver colon bileduct lung   
                               breast throat & sundry areas of the brain   


we are no better in accounting for death, and no worse:       we still die 
we carry our uninhabited mortal frames back to the land 
                      cover them in sod, we take the land to the brink   
          of our dying:    it stands watch, dutifully, artfully 
enriched with sewer sludge and urea 
                                             to green against eternity of green 


hocus-pocus:    here is a pig in a farrowing crate 
                                     eating its own feces   
human in its ability to litter inside a cage 
                        to nest, to grow gravid and to throw its young 

I know I should be mindful of dangerous analogy: 
          the pig is only the pig 
                         and we aren't merely the wide-open field 
                                    flattened to a space resembling nothing 



you want me to tell you the marvels of invention?    that we persevere 
that the time of flourishing is at hand?    I should like to think it 

meanwhile, where have I put the notebook on which I was scribbling 

it began like: 
                     "the smell of droppings and that narrow country road . . ."





And So the Skin . . .
 

And so their pounded hearts 
were worn-- 
                                       like a badge 
                  or talisman, 
that canceled   
almost all their blindness-- 

creation's linkage depending 
                                    on a drive itself 
         derived from a kind of kindness 
or desperation, the sense that one's 
inadequate, 
                                    at any rate 

the space for time-- 

water has it, flowing   
(even from a faucet . . .) 
and here the black swan glides across it-- 

as the sunlight's suddenly on my back, 
and now the skin along it's warmer, 
Lord,   
                  which lets me walk by the river . . .





Coexistence: A Lost and Almost Found Poem
 

And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel, with a loud voice: --Deuteronomy 27:14
Over the border the barrier winds, 
devouring orchards of various kinds. 

Cursed be he that taketh away   
          the landmark of his neighbor. 
And all the people shall say, Amen. 

The road was blocked in a battle of wills-- 
as the lame and sightless trudged through the hills. 

Cursed be he that maketh the blind   
          to go astray in the way. 
And all the people shall say, Amen. 

The army has nearly written a poem: 
You'll now need a permit just to stay home. 

Cursed be he that perverteth the justice   
          due to the stranger (in Scripture). 
And all the people shall say, Amen. 

Taken away--in the dead of night-- 
by the secret policeman, who might be a Levite. 

Cursed be he that turneth to smite   
          his neighbor in secret murder. 
And all the people shall say, Amen-- 

as peace is sought through depredation, 
living together in separation. 

Cursed be he that confirmeth not 
          the words of this law--to do them.    
And all the people shall say, Amen.





Ludlow
 

An inch from the curse and pearled 
by the evening heat       I shake 
my polo neck and a cool draught 
buffs my chest. What rises is 
my animal aroma             the scent 
of blue-ribbon stock      the sort 
a starred chef would ladle from 
a zinc-bottomed pan    to soften   
and savor the hock he has sawn   
and roasted for the diners out front   
who sip at shots of pastis and gnaw   
around the pits of kalamata olives.   
                                                          My head 
sits in his fridge: stooping for herb 
butter, our eyes meet and he touches 
my cotton-cold face      just as once 
I stroked your cheek in a dream 
you suffered in a room above the river.





Against Conceit
 

Don't say Sir Pigeon in his cobalt bonnet. 
Don't find among your notes 
jottings on duvets and blizzards and the page   

unwalked across               black missives of girlhood 
must be sent off and do not claim the furnace   
of the universe is powered by human screams. 

When the dark turns dark 
or when the bullet lifts a scalp, 
it is enough to know the lover feels the slap 

that the world can hear the sharp shout   
               which wakes the cat 
her claws one inch from the rabbit's bobbing scut.





Ornithogalum Dubium
 

Lame again, I limp home along Lawn Terrace 
with a flowering sun star in a paper wrap 

then back to the village with a lame cat 
twisting and woeful in her cage. 

Bread these days isn't baked to last: 
how sad those posh loaves thudding off 

in pine breadbins all around the Heath: 
soulless latterday pets, frisky for a day   

or two, then binned or thrown to foxes, 
loaves just an inch of gloom below 

the caged birds you notice in corners 
of those same mansions when you seek 

the past, dinking their mirrors, dipping 
once in a while for a sip of milk.





Odysseus Hears of the Death of Kalypso
 

All their songs are of one hour 
Before dawn, when the birds begin. 
I sing another. 
In helpless midday, at the hour 
Even sparrows have no heart to shrill 
Comes news . . . Suddenly, the unimaginable 
Needs imagination and finds none. 

Violet ocean only nothing. 
Smoke of thyme and of cedar, 
Ornate birds, nothing. 
Even a god who came here, 
Hearing a sweet voice,   
Would find only old fires now, 
Brittle in the blackened trees.   

She was mast and sail. She was 
A stillness pregnant with motion, 
Adorable to me as, all my life, 
I have hidden a cruel, secret ocean 
In sinews and in sleep and cowardice. 
She forgave me. Once, she wept for me. 
Our child died then, and she is with him.





Death
 

Death calls my dog by the wrong name. 
A little man when I was small, Death grew 
Beside me, always taller, but always 
Confused as I have almost never been.   
Confusion, like the heart, gets left behind 
Early by a boy, abandoned the very moment 
Futurity with her bare arms comes a-waltzing 
Down the fire escapes to take his hand. 

"Death," I said, "if your eyes were green 
I would eat them."    

For what are days but the furnace of an eye? 
If I could strip a sunflower bare to its bare soul, 
I would rebuild it: 
Green inside of green, ringed round by green. 
There'd be nothing but new flowers anymore. 
Absolute Christmas. 

"Death," I said, "I know someone, a woman, 
Who sank her teeth into the moon." 

For what are space and time but the inventions 
Of sorrowing men? The soul goes faster than light. 
Eating the moon alive, it leaves space and time behind. 
The soul is forgiveness because it knows forgiveness. 
And the knowledge is whirligig. 
Whirligig taught me to live outwardly. 
Shoe shop. . . pizza parlor. . . surgical appliances. . . 
All left behind me with the hooey. 
My soul is my home. 
An old star hounded by old starlight. 

"Death, I ask you, whose only story 
Is the end of the story, right from the start, 
How is it I remember everything 
That never happened and almost nothing that did? 
Was I ever born?" 

I think of the suicides, all of them thriving, 
Many of them painting beautiful pictures. 
I think of boys and girls murdered 
In their first beauty, now with children of their own. 
And I have a church in my mind, set cruelly ablaze, 
And then the explosion of happy souls 
Into the greeny, frozen Christmas Eve air: 
Another good Christmas, a white choir. 

Beside each other still, 
My Death and I are a magical hermit. 
Dear Mother, I miss you. 
Dear reader, your eyes are now green, 
Green as they used to be, before I was born.





A Lowrider Loudly Brings Us
 

a thing that's called radar love, 
the whole hog calling, 
and here's unhoused Ginger, 
distracted wind-beaten beauty 
separating from park bench 
and Frigidaire carton, 
flying Halloween colors,   
tie-dye skirt, Orangesicle socks, 
where will she sleep tonight, 
where lay those tulle angel wings   
slashed through her overcoat,   
who pulses anarchist patchouli   
and minty hair draughts 
and cigarette spirits that scuff   
our fragile air while we hope for 
some pick-me-up before we pass.





What To Do
 

Places we leave 
slick our bodies 
with silky air   
or foam we feel 
faithful and tickly 
(even somehow taste) 
but can't clearly see. 
We wear its weight 
like atmosphere-- 
runs, blots 
of what we've done   
in and with   
each place   
--what to do 
with it now?-- 
and what it does 
to us still.





Pompeii
 

The rich men, they know about suffering 
That comes from natural things, the fate that 
Rich men say they can't control, the swell of   
The tides, the erosion of polar caps 
And the eruption of a terrible 
Greed among those who cease to be content 
With what they lack when faced with wealth they are   
Too ignorant to understand. Such wealth   
Is the price of progress. The fishmonger   
Sees the dread on the faces of the trout 
And mackerel laid out at the market   
Stall on quickly melting ice. In Pompeii 
The lava flowed and buried the people 
So poems such as this could be born.

Anything But the Case
 

Do me my elegy now, or I'll scrawl the thing 
I scrawl as you're going or screw in a ball when you're gone, 
Or you and I write unaware in each other's tongue 
That you or I ever set foot . . . Or do what our son 
And/or little daughter got done: got our brilliant names 
Pricily grooved in marble by one skilled 
In times of loss; dream iridescent dreams 
It's that first Saturday. Let this hour be filled 
With anything but the case, so that Time the clerk 
Goes panting in horror from gremlin to error to glitch 
And his screen is stripes and he knows he saved his work 
In one of a billion files but fuck knows which, 
And he lets us alone or, at worst, as we tiptoe by, 
Feels we're familiar, can't for the world say why.





It Was a Bichon Fris's Life . . .
 

Louisiana skies paddle north nodding hello to some exiles 
displaced by floodwaters so we all putter in the bisque 
in fretted dresses, alleviated by a fan. But we have nothing on 

"Le Matin," in whose rococo frame a curtain sweeps to bare 
a boudoir, a Bichon Fris worrying something between paws, 
begging the dulcet glance of the mistress whose push-up, 

cupless corset and up-drawn stocking border what they 
fall short of, per the stern frame rippling like a cloud! 
Even the candle angles to get a look in the mirror 

engloving the scene. Why it is her slipper the bitch clutches!   
The gentleman's reverie is elsewhere . . . Loitering 
Louisiana stops to admire this engraving by "N. Lavreinee." 

What a chevalier! It makes the smeariest sunset think 
it's in a Restoration Comedy, in such humidity 
chefs defer meringues. "Ksar Rouge," "Taos Adobe," 

"Gulf Shrimp"--a thousand names of softboiled 
lipsticks fritter English as if it were French, meaning 
meeting no resistance from the flesh.





A Not Unruffled Surface
 

The sky was laced with Irish cream mist, that mellow tan overhanging the hills, which were studded with deathmasks and baskets spilling flowers from both ends. 
We scanned the haze for lightning. 
They were studded with earthworks and iron forks inserted between leaves of grass, jacks and bearings and balances, sinuous fingers of pink marble and synovial joints in bronze. 
But if we got struck by lightning--not a lot; say glanced, or shaved, there was a chance (we heard) it wouldn't be so bad: a little refreshing, a little like La Vita Nuova in a readable translation. 
"In a flash," as they say, we could acquire a self-renewing subscription to classical music (it's always classical in the scientific literature) accessible at all hours and piped into the forebrain from the hypothalamus. 

This space available for celebrations. 
Someone visits for the first time and says, "Oh, let's get married here" and guests drive in and eye the hors d'oeuvre tent before finding a folding chair. 
But it isn't long before the mirroring going on between, for instance, the sculptures and   
the trees--the trees looking more like sculptures, the sculptures getting seasoned, growing bark (patinas) even--it isn't long before it hypnotizes the guests. 
Who would wear a wedding dress in such a charged atmosphere, having heard that ghost story of the wedding dress with the power to possess the soul of the bride? 
Actually it was a horror flick from somewhere, Tokyo or Calcutta . . . 
It was a wedding dress that took possession of the soul of its bride the minute she saw it in the mirror, or it saw itself--and this we know happens, but not with the malevolence of this dress that wreaked havoc at the reception, set the hall on fire and dropped a crate of champagne on the string trio. 
"Aha," cries the groom as he realizes the chrysalis of evil he must divide from his bride: "You are hardly an unruffled surface!" 
No you would not want to wear that dress amid the wireless network of gigantic sculptures and their wind-scraped murmuring. 
When the wind stirs, is it not the gardeners? 
The gardeners are invisible, they don't garden during business hours. 
As you'd put a dye in the air in order to see it, a bird sucked through its drafts advertises the invisible and upgrades it to naked.





Voyager
 

We've packed our bags, we're set to fly 
no one knows where, the maps won't do. 
We're crossing the ocean's nihilistic blue 
with an unborn infant's opal eye. 

It has the clarity of earth and sky 
seen from a spacecraft, once removed, 
as through an amniotic lens, that groove- 
lessness of space, the last star by. 

We have set out to live and die 
into the interstices of a new 
nowhere to be or be returning to 

(a little like an infant's airborne cry). 
We've set our sights on nothing left to lose 
and made of loss itself a lullaby.





Roman Room
 

Someday our buried life will come to this: 
a shaft of sunlight touching the Etruscan 
surfaces, the basin still intact 
as if awaiting hands. How many 

centuries sequestered is an expert's guess, 
you tell me. I admire the tiles 
some craftsman spiraled in the ceiling's dome 
detailing Neptune's beard. Or someone's. 

What will they say of us, who have no home 
(we like to say) but one another? When they pry 
our hearts apart and excavate the sum, 
is that the place we'll lie? Where the words lie?





Parting Song
 

First 
it is one day without you.

Then two.
And soon,

our point: moot. 
And our solution, diluted.

And our class action (if ever was)
is no longer suited.

Wherewith I give to looting through
the war chest of our past

like a wily Anne Bonny 
who snatches at plunder or graft. 

But the wreck of that ransack,
that strongbox, our splintering coffer,

the claptrap bastard 
of the best we had to offer,

is sog-soaked and clammy, 
empty but for sand. 

Like the knuckle-white cup 
of my urgent, ghastly hands

in which nothing but 
the ghost of love is held.

Damn it to hell.





4:13 am
 

The shift of sleepwalks and suicides. 
The occasion of owls and a demi-lune fog. 
Even God has nodded off 

And won't be taking prayers til ten. 
Ad interim, you put them on.   
As if your wants could keep you warm. 

As if. You say your shibboleths. 
You thumb your beads. You scry the glass. 
Night creeps to its precipice 

And the broken rim of reason breaks 
Again. An obsidian sky betrays you. 
Every serrate shadow flays you. 

Soon enough, the crow will caw. 
The cock will crow. The door will close. 
(He isn't coming back, you know.) 

And so wee, wet hours of grief relent.   
In thirty years you might forget 
Precisely how tonight's pain felt. 

And in whose black house you dwelt.





Djinn
 

Haunted, they say, believing 
the soft, shifty 
dunes are made up 
of false promises. 

Many believe   
whatever happens   
is the other half 
of a conversation. 

Many whisper 
white lies 
to the dead. 

"The boys are doing really well." 

Some think 
nothing is so 
until it has been witnessed. 

They believe 
the bits are iffy; 

the forces that bind them, 
absolute.





Missing Persons
 

God and Mother 
went the same way. 

          *       *       * 

What's a person to us 
but a contortion 
of pressure ridges 
palpable 
long after she is gone? 

          *       *       * 

A thin old man in blue jeans, 
back arched, grimaces 
at the freezer compartment. 

          *       *       * 

Lying in the tub, 
I'm telling them-- 

the missing persons-- 

that a discrepancy 
is a pea 

and I am a Princess.





Hoop
 

1 

God twirled 
across the face of 
what cannot be named 
since it was not moving. 

God was momentum then, 
that impatience 
with interruption, 

stamping time's blanks 
with its own image. 

2 

Now her theme will be 
that she has escaped 
certain destruction, 

that she is   
impossibly lucky. 

This theme should be jaunty 
but slightly discordant, 

coming in, as it does, 
so late. 

The character 
associated with this theme 
should be dressed 
in markedly old-fashioned clothing-- 

a hoop skirt perhaps-- 

while everyone else   
is in cut-offs, 

ready for the barbeque.





Apartment
 

1 

The woman on the mantel, 
who doesn't much resemble me, 
is holding a chainsaw 
away from her body, 
with a shocked smile, 
while an undiscovered tumor 
squats on her kidney. 

2 

The present 
is a sentimental favorite, 
with its heady mix 
of grandiosity 
and abjection, 
truncated, 
framed. 

3 

It's as if I'm subletting 
a friend's apartment. 
Even in the dream, 
I'm trying to imagine   
which friend. 

And I'm trying to get 
all my robes together, 
robes I really own and 
robes I don't





The Apophatic
 

How can it not be 
about engine, 
secret blaze behind 
the wheels? How not about 
this no-way-to-resist seeing   
but one side or another   
since the rails quite insist 
& iron's so right, always 
running off its own might.   
How never about freightage 
or the outdoor face 
in the indoor light? 
A yesteryear's pall 
over the day at hand? Not 
about the passings-by 
of nailed-shut houses 
& grouse setting sail 
from a rusty swing?   
How not me out of uniform,   
out of a sleeper's berth, 
bare & barely rising   
atop smoke & so little air left 
in the soft underbelly   
that I may meet--nay, embrace-- 
the hello-goodbye cloud.





Daddy: 1933
 

If one takes   
a walk on a clear sunny   
day in middle April, 

when the first   
willows are in bloom,   
one may often see   

young bumblebee queens   
eagerly sipping 
nectar from the catkins-- 

thus begins 
the one book written 
by Otto Emil Plath. 

It is a delightful thing 
to pause and watch 
these queens, clad 

in their costumes of rich   
velvet, their wings 
not yet torn-- 

he wrote it the year after   
Sylvia was born-- 
by the long foraging 

flights which   
they will be obliged   
to take later.





Puppet-Maker
 

In his fear of solitude, he made us.   
Fearing eternity, he gave us time. 
I hear his white cane thumping 
Up and down the hall. 

I expect neighbors to complain, but no. 
The little girl who sobbed 
When her daddy crawled into her bed 
Is quiet now.   

It's quarter to two. 
On this street of darkened pawnshops, 
Welfare hotels and tenements, 
One or two ragged puppets are awake.





Beirut Tank
 

Staring up into the tank's belly lit 
by a bare bulb hanging down off 
the exhaust, a mechanic's hands are up 
inside the dark metallic innards doing something 
that looks personal, private. This tank is nothing 
like the ones the Americans deploy. 
Those have uranium piercing shells that could melt 
right through this tank's armor and set off 
the ammo box: nothing can withstand the American tanks.   

The barrel's called a cannon. The machine guns they call 
deterrents. The tank is old, small, about the size 
of a horse and cart. The armor plate shines green 
under the streetlight. The sprockets, almost rusted out.   
Somebody forgot to grease the nipples. The timing belt is nicked 
and worn. The spare parts from France don't fit. This wire   
crossed with this wire makes a catastrophic fire. 
Be careful how you route it. .20 caliber ammo 
goes in the hatch behind the armor plate.   

The mechanic on his back in the dirt, 
cursing in Arabic, sounds like he's cursing 
in a good-natured way: who was the fucking moron 
who did the maintenance on this thing?   
This tank, this tank, he should push it off 
a cliff into the sea so that it could bob for 
half an hour before sinking under the Pigeon Rocks 
where all the lovers gather in the shadows 
near that little bar, lit by a generator, that serves arak   

and warm beer to soldiers hanging out on the Corniche: 
mainly conscripts from down south, whose orange groves 
rot because nobody can pick the oranges: try to pick 
an orange and a cluster bomb lodged in leaves 
comes tumbling into your basket. What weight oil 
did this cocksucker use, anyway? And this engine, 
it's gonna blow. Beat up tanks and sandbags, 
that's all this army is, old sparkplugs that get fouled 
so that you have to file the gaps over and over. 

He stares up in that live, minute, completely   
concentrated way of scrutinizing something   
or someone you thought you understood: 
the tank's underbody completely covers his body 
so they look like they're embracing when he reaches up 
inside it, his needle nose pliers crimping, twisting,   
pulling down hard. There, you see that, it's all corroded. 
The cannon jutting out looks both threatening   
and vulnerable as if the tank's firepower 

were dependent on that wire. He runs two fingers 
up and down it, then feels where rust, 
mixed into an oily paste, shines like bloody flux 
that he gently dips his finger in, sniffs and tastes. 
Clanging back his tapping on the armor plate,   
as he listens to her talking on his back in the dirt, screwing in   
the spare parts, the tank says what tanks always say,   
Fix me, oil me, grease me, make it fit, 
confirming what he knows about the French.





Stranding
 

What came wafting    
down the ditch 
by the marsh grass waving   
opened a hole   
in the day through which,   

like a puff of breath, 
a ghost fountained up 
rising in soft slo-mo, 
lost, desolate, no place 
left to go.   

Dear bloody 
Beirut and its internet cafes 
were still smoking 
from last night's 
"little bombing."   

Such threads, tattered sleeves 
blown all over the street 
from Emporio Armani. 
Husband and wife shot   
dead at the airport checkpoint. 

Where else would this lead? 
The investiture 
of grieving takes all day 
to sweep up in the tidal spillage 
of plate glass. 

What ish my nation, 
asked Captain MacMorris 
between battles. 
But the ditch knows   
just who we are-- 

and I see its only water 
on a stealth raid 
of the glimmer 
hidden in the reeds. 
And when I come close, 

little scavenger flashings 
and great claws held out rigidly 
scuttle back into mud holes 
drilling the bank. 
Bending down to look, 

I could smell the corruption's 
gathering, sweetish odor, 
its sonar gone haywire 
driving it to shore. 
What choices are you given,   

what makes you want to swim   
out of your own element? 
The demure little ear-holes 
and intelligent clear eyes, 
the fate from birth sealed   

inside its smile,   
spent flukes and tail   
being gnawed to bone. 
The curt unrevealing stare 
mirroring back my own.





For the Executive Director of the Fallen
 

In memoriam Liam Rector
The little boy crying out 
Weenie Weenie 
in self-panicking delight, 
waving his little cock 
under the banner 

of the sun, seemed pure Blake, 
all anarchy and energy, 
an innocence unfrightened 
of itself that shook the lake's 
waters and unsettled 

the strained composures 
and appointed certainties 
of whatever Absolute Speaker 
had been ranting in my brain: 
Peace Through Strength 

Justice Must Be Ours-- 
so many demon faces 
in the glass city. 
Each pubic triangle 
seemed, under the bathing suits, 

to grow electrical and crackle 
with a sexual shock 
that made me turn my face away: 
and who should be there 
but you, my dear Lord of Misrule, 

blowing smoke in all our faces, 
the clean bullet hole in your forehead 
above your self-ironic smile: 
Don't let the monkeys   
stop typing-- 

and after I swam 
and I was sitting on the bank, 
after the boy and his parents 
had packed up and gone home, 
I played the Noh play over for you 

in the tape loop of the void 
where your voice and laughter 
so casually reside: 
how the mother 
gone searching for her 

missing son finds him dancing 
by the lake, and as she tries 
to   hold him he slips through 
her arms just as she slips   
through his arms-- 

and as she cries out 
in perfect pitch in perfect time 
to the shrieking bamboo flute 
that her boy has drowned 
she understands that she too   

has drowned, that she too 
is a ghost returning   
to dance as they   
dance together in a tighter   
and tighter round.





Time to Play
 

Now it's time to play. Nobody says, 
like they used to, but in my bones 
the desire overwhelms me. "Write! 
Make a poem," say the bones. 

The inlet will come first. It always does. 
Water calls urgently, "egret." The waterbird 
that moves elastically over the surface 
making everything focus soon or late. 

Now my hand enters. It always does. 
It gives the bones reason to observe. 
It makes the egret the finest thing in sight 
and the water intelligent north of here. 

Water is genius because it is interconnected. 
Drop south knows drop north. 
But the bones will lose their joy 
if the bird overwhelms the old playground.





The Green Car
 

Defend me. I am not capable. 
The river sweeps by three minutes at once 
cleansing me of guilt. But the bear 
crashes through it and breaches my 
innocence. 
He rages and frightens my innocence. 

The psychologist says, "You are the bear. 
You are the river. 
You are the green car 
crossing the bridge. Defend yourself." 

But the green car 
is in a forest I have failed to speak to. 
The green car was never intended 
to drive in that forest, 
not cross a bridge 
that must not exist in a real dream. 
Further, the real dream 
defends itself.





Bird at the Window
 

Beyond is a brightness 
I am not equal to 

Yet what I see   
Turns into what I want, 

And to bring nothing but this body 
To pass through 

The one thing between   
Myself and what I crave, 

Almost done, the world a ruin   
Of leaves, winter at the throat, 

My song over and over until   
So familiar I can do 

What I am about to do 
While you who rise from the table 

And walk from room to room 
Will remember only the sound 

Of what cast herself through 
All that glass, instead of the song 

That was sung until finally 
You would ask to know more.





The Years
 

Nothing required an account of me   
And still I didn't give one. 

I might have been a virtual casualty,   
A late victim of the Millennium Bug. 

No spontaneity, no insubordination,   
Not even any spare capacity.





Night
 

It's all right   
Unless you're either lonely or under attack.   
That strange effortful 
Repositioning of yourself. Laundry, shopping,   
Hours, the telephone--unless misinformed-- 
Only ever ringing for you, if it ever does.   
The night--yours to decide, 
Among drink, or books, or lying there. 
On your back, or curled up. 

An embarrassment of poverty.





For Adam
 

In that aftertime 
I wasn't writing. I never wrote,   
I didn't know what the aftertime was for.   
I felt little, collected nothing. 

I talked to myself, but it was boring.





Instructions to an Artisan
 

Into the rood wood, where the grain's current splits   
around the stones of its knots, carve eyelashes and eyelids.   
Dye the knots, too--indigo, ink-black, vermillion   
irises. These will be his eyes, always open, willing   
themselves not to close when dust rises or sweat falls,   
eyes witnessing, dimly, the eclipse that shawls   
the shuddering hill, Jerusalem's naked shoulder.   
The body itself? From a wick that still whiffs of smolder,   
wax, because wax sloughs a smooth skein on the fingers just   
below sensation's threshold. Prop the cross   
upright and let the tear-hot wax trickle, slow, clot, taper   
into a torso, thighs, calves, feet. Of Gideon Bible paper,   
thinner than skin, cut him his scrap of cloth; embed   
iron shavings in his forehead,   
and, as the wax cools, scrape the rust off an old fuel can   
to salt the whole wound that is the man.   
Cry, if you feel like crying, and if no one else is there.   
Then set it on the counter with your other wares.





Dead Butterfly
 

For months my daughter carried   
a dead monarch in a quart mason jar.   
To and from school in her backpack,   
to her only friend's house.   At the dinner table   
it sat like a guest alongside the pot roast.   
She took it to bed, propped by her pillow.   

Was it the year her brother was born?   
Was this her own too-fragile baby   
that had lived--so briefly--in its glassed world?   
Or the year she refused to go to her father's house?   
Was this the holding-her-breath girl she became there?   

This plump child in her rolled-down socks   
I sometimes wanted to haul back inside me   
and carry safe again.   What was her fierce   
commitment?   I never understood.   
We just lived with the dead winged thing   
as part of her, as part of us,   
weightless in its heavy jar.





Wheel
 

You can say the broken word but cannot speak 
for it, can name a precise and particular shade 
of blue if you can remember its name 
(Woman of the South, New Lilac, Second Sky?) 

As the light, close to blinding, fell--falls 
in bars across a particular page, this 
then another, some other 
followed far too closely by night 

Or as the sleeping 
pages recall themselves, one by one, 
in dream-riddled, guarded tones, 
recall themselves from path 

to sloped meadow, meadow 
to burnt shore, shore 
to poised wave, dismay 
to present, any present 

of the bewildered and the buried alive 
(we've been told they were buried alive) 
Is there a door he hasn't noticed 
and beyond it a letter which created the door 

or claims it created a door 
which would open either way





Recursus
 

The voice, because of its austerity, will often cause dust to rise. 

   The voice, because of its austerity, will sometimes attempt the representation of dust. 

   Someone will say, I can't breathe--as if choking on dust. 

   The voice ages with the body. 

   It will say, I was shaped by light escaping from a keyhole. 

   Or, I am the shape of that light. 

   It will say, For the body to breathe, a layer must be peeled away. 

   It will say, What follows is a picture of how things are for me now. 

   It will say, The rose is red, twice two is four--as if another were present. 

   The dust rises in spirals. 

   It will say, The distance from Cairo to anywhere is not that great. 

   As if one had altered the adjustment of a microscope. 

   Or examined its working parts. 

   Possibly an instrument covered with dust and forgotten on a shelf. 

   Beside a hatbox and a pair of weathered boots. 

   The voice will expand to fill a given space. 

   As if to say, This space is not immeasurable. 

   This space is not immeasurable. 

   When held before your eyes. 

   And which voice is it says (or claims to say), Last night I dreamt of walls and courses of brick, last night I dreamt of limbs. 

   As you dream--always unwillingly--of a writing not visible and voices muffled by walls. 

   As if the question: lovers, prisoners, visitors. 

   The voice, as an act of discipline or play, will imitate other voices. 

   This is what I am doing now. 

   This is what I'm doing now. 

   The clock behind my back, its Fuse mechanism. 

   Voice one recognizes from years before. 

   Beneath water, hidden by a spark. 

   Here at the heart of winter, or let's say spring. 

   Voice with a history before its eyes. 

   With a blue dot before its eyes. 

   History of dust before its eyes. 

   It will say, as if remembering, The letter S stands for a slow match burning. 

   On the table before me. 

   No numbers on this watch. 

   And I live in a red house that once was brown. 

   A paper house, sort of falling down. 

   Such is the history of this house. 

   It looks like this. 

   Looks just like this. 

   We think to say in some language.

Something else. 


                                                                                        for Poul Borum





Congratulating Wedge
 

All things belie me, I think, but I 
look at them though. Well boys, at 
least you're not dead, right? What's 
the date today? Until something. What? 
Of the lady of the whitening blow. 
I'm ashamed to keep on babbling 
as if I've always been oneself, 
diamond flow through. Humble 
flannel skeleton. Grin, laugh unbecoming 
Living at the bottom of the water may 
have been obvious all the time. But 
I forget. What's my plot? Hand 
of a child, paw of an animal. Paint 
it red & make a pawprint in the psalter. 
Protect her & give her back her hat 
Entangle her dreams in demotic and 
Warm her feet; cheat the judge 
& protect the tree from which he was carved. 


                                  * 

And now that I've explained the situation 
Jesus my frame hurts, you say. 
Fucking pain. Hey come & empty my ashtray 
once more & don't get so excited. A 
gentle heart was broken. Whose? No one's 
It's a figure like a frame among 
medlars & briars. Hand me that piece of 
that, just that, yeah. I don't mean it, 
I've never meant anything because that's 
not what I do, in the mountains I call home 
How can I tell you of my wound? it's 
round & silver & headstrong, it's 
nothing more than temperament born 
of a custom involving a circuitous journey 
This is all wrong. It rains today, my 
son's singing love songs of this 
country, already being ten. 


                                  * 

And if to withstand this nocturnal pollution of the tiny 
wanton stars with bent hook clauses of misprision 
I'm supposed to sing the melody of an unexpecting part. . . 
Hey a pretty honey come a listen to me 
while I evening, darling, your messages, 
what would you think then? But I 
wouldn't do that. Light surrounded oranges 
towels clouds. You don't think you're my you. 
Not here not you. You still think you're he. she. 
Because I wouldn't "you you, would I? I only 
"you some other he. she. I 
who write poems. When she writes them, 
it's different. . .A world of words, right? 
It's only my version of The Entertainer 
Nothing truly personal, I'm way above that. 
I've learned about it for a lot of days. I've 
been to see the doctor & you have to have shots 
for it. 17 balls of yarn & a sewing machine. 


                                  * 

No I wouldn't know why anyone would 
want to write like that. I should never 
have had to do it. We were used to this 
other thing we always know like when we're 
here. And you have this clear head & you're 
seeing things & there they are. You don't 
notice they're spelled. That's how you 
know you're alive. I never saw you 







Seeing the Eclipse in Maine
 

It started about noon.  On top of Mount Batte,   
We were all exclaiming.  Someone had a cardboard   
And a pin, and we all cried out when the sun   
Appeared in tiny form on the notebook cover.   

It was hard to believe.  The high school teacher   
We'd met called it a pinhole camera,   
People in the Renaissance loved to do that.   
And when the moon had passed partly through   

We saw on a rock underneath a fir tree,   
Dozens of crescents--made the same way--   
Thousands!  Even our straw hats produced   
A few as we moved them over the bare granite.   

We shared chocolate, and one man from Maine   
Told a joke.  Suns were everywhere--at our feet.





Fried Beauty
 

Glory be to God for breaded things--   
   Catfish, steak finger, pork chop, chicken thigh,   
         Sliced green tomatoes, pots full to the brim   
With french fries, fritters, life-float onion rings,   
    Hushpuppies, okra golden to the eye,   
            That in all oils, corn or canola, swim   

Toward mastication's maw (O molared mouth!);   
    Whatever browns, is dumped to drain and dry   
             On paper towels' sleek translucent scrim,   
These greasy, battered bounties of the South:   
                            Eat them.





Sugar
 

          
          A violent luck and a whole sample and even then quiet.    Water is squeezing, water is almost squeezing on lard. Water, water is a mountain and it is selected and it is so practical that there is no use in money. A mind under is exact and so it is necessary to have a mouth and eye glasses.    A question of sudden rises and more time than awfulness is so easy and shady. There is precisely that noise.    A peck a small piece not privately overseen, not at all not a slice, not at all crestfallen and open, not at all mounting and chaining and evenly surpassing, all the bidding comes to tea.    A separation is not tightly in worsted and sauce, it is so kept well and sectionally.    Put it in the stew, put it to shame. A little slight shadow and a solid fine furnace.    The teasing is tender and trying and thoughtful.    The line which sets sprinkling to be a remedy is beside the best cold.    A puzzle, a monster puzzle, a heavy choking, a neglected Tuesday.    Wet crossing and a likeness, any likeness, a likeness has blisters, it has that and teeth, it has the staggering blindly and a little green, any little green is ordinary.    One, two and one, two, nine, second and five and that.    A blaze, a search in between, a cow, only any wet place, only this tune.    Cut a gas jet uglier and then pierce pierce in between the next and negligence. Choose the rate to pay and pet pet very much. A collection of all around, a signal poison, a lack of languor and more hurts at ease.    A white bird, a colored mine, a mixed orange, a dog.    Cuddling comes in continuing a change.    A piece of separate outstanding rushing is so blind with open delicacy.    A canoe is orderly. A period is solemn. A cow is accepted.    A nice old chain is widening, it is absent, it is laid by.
        




A White Hunter
 

A white hunter is nearly crazy.





A Substance in a Cushion
 

          
          The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.    Callous is something that hardening leaves behind what will be soft if there is a genuine interest in there being present as many girls as men. Does this change. It shows that dirt is clean when there is a volume.    A cushion has that cover. Supposing you do not like to change, supposing it is very clean that there is no change in appearance, supposing that there is regularity and a costume is that any the worse than an oyster and an exchange. Come to season that is there any extreme use in feather and cotton. Is there not much more joy in a table and more chairs and very likely roundness and a place to put them.    A circle of fine card board and a chance to see a tassel.    What is the use of a violent kind of delightfulness if there is no pleasure in not getting tired of it. The question does not come before there is a quotation. In any kind of place there is a top to covering and it is a pleasure at any rate there is some venturing in refusing to believe nonsense. It shows what use there is in a whole piece if one uses it and it is extreme and very likely the little things could be dearer but in any case there is a bargain and if there is the best thing to do is to take it away and wear it and then be reckless be reckless and resolved on returning gratitude.    Light blue and the same red with purple makes a change. It shows that there is no mistake. Any pink shows that and very likely it is reasonable. Very likely there should not be a finer fancy present. Some increase means a calamity and this is the best preparation for three and more being together. A little calm is so ordinary and in any case there is sweetness and some of that.    A seal and matches and a swan and ivy and a suit.    A closet, a closet does not connect under the bed. The band if it is white and black, the band has a green string. A sight a whole sight and a little groan grinding makes a trimming such a sweet singing trimming and a red thing not a round thing but a white thing, a red thing and a white thing.    The disgrace is not in carelessness nor even in sewing it comes out out of the way.    What is the sash like. The sash is not like anything mustard it is not like a same thing that has stripes, it is not even more hurt than that, it has a little top.  





A Carafe, that is a Blind Glass
 

          
          A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling. The difference is spreading.
        




My Fathers Closet
 

1  hat    


As soon as I put it on 
Brooklyn went dark, 
but when I took it off 
my wooden horse stared at me 
with dazzling glass eyes. 


                  2  coat    

The shirred hem 
swished on the floor. 
Huge shoulders sloped 
like pines under snow. 
A panel in the lapel 
read Kuut, Tallinn 
in thread letters. 
I hid at the center 
behind jet buttons 
too round to undo. 
That coarse-nap wool 
outlasted Estonian winter 
but now the moths 
left a trellis of holes 
so it was never dark 
when I curled up 
hugging my knees. 
My mother cried out: 
Who are you?   I answered 
in my deepest voice: 
His coat.  


                  3  shoes    

I shoved my hands in 
and taught them to walk: 
now stumble, now march 
against your will, left, right, 
to the Narva front: 

now dance: 
                  and somewhere 
in that immense city 
where snow trembled 
in high lit windows, 
a footstep receded, 
rapid, urgent, 
indelible as a name. 






Trouble Deaf Heaven
 

Sonnet 29
Is there a sound? There is a forest. 
What is the world? The word is wilderness. 
What is the answer? The answer is the world. 
What is the beginning? A beginning is happiness. 
What is the end? No one lives there now. 
What is a beginning? The beginning is light. 
What makes happiness? Nothing. 
What makes an ending? What does not. 
What is her skin?  Her skin is composed of strange clothing and clouds of butterflies, 
          of events and odors, of the rose fingers of dawn, transparent suns of full 
          daylight, blue loves of dusk and night fish with huge eyes.  
                                                                                    Max Walter Svanberg 
What makes a question? Birds in the evening. 
When do birds die? When it is complete. 
What makes a world? The leaves shimmer in the wind, they 
          reverberate with small heat and large wind and they cannot be counted. 
What is music? A man lives there with his sister, they count the buses passing 
          their window, and they count the small-winged insects which die on that 
          windowsill.   
Who is happy? Nothing is necessary, everything that is is. 
When does it end? A green delight the wounded mind endears 
          After the hustling world is broken off. 
                                                                                     John Clare 
What is the beginning? The completion. 
How does it complicate? In that it dazzles. 
When does it matter? Blue loaves of dusk. 
Who perishes?   
Who listens? There will be prizes. 
What is a child? Blue lives of dusk. 
Where does dust come from? From tropical skies. 
When is it over?...into childhood...into fantasy...through the streets of New   
          York...through tropical skies....into the receiving trays the balls come to rest 
          releasing prizes. 
                                                                        Joseph Cornell 
What does a child do? Listens with his body, with her body. 
When does it end? Listens with the hands. 
Does it end? The hands which are small and wide. 
Where do children come from? White pebbles. 
Who suffers? No one returns from there. 
Who suffers? There was once a small forest with a path of white pebbles 
          and a tame group of frights and follies; whoever entered knew 
          the path would carry them to the other side, but that it would be 
          scary and fun at the same time. No one who entered was ever seen again. 
Is there a sound? There is a forest. 
Who listens? The large lady with the small dog, she leans into the   
          neighbor's yard to sniff the hydrangea once more hoping   
          this time it will have an odor, a sweetness which she feels 
          such a desperate need for she is near despair, she is thinking 
          of killing herself except who would care for the dog, who could know 
          what he feels what he needs what his smelly bed in the corner actually 
          means to him. 
What matters? There is a forest.    
Who listens? Another theory of the origin of the universe holds that 
          "matter is a way of thinking, a little like love, actually, if you think 
          of it that way.    
What matters? There is a forest. 
What is the word? There is color, and no one know what to do with it.    
          We would be happier without it is one theory; we are irresponsible 
          and full of angers like colors. 
What does the child think? The child. 
What does the child think? Happiness. 
What child? A word is a small part of itself, it is round at times, and it satisfies 
          only itself. 
Does it answer? It does not. 
What is pain? A small island, or perhaps it is a large island, the adjective is   
          merely relative and a convenience. There are a few inhabitants--one,   
          actually, ever at a time--and the sky's red would perhaps be beautiful if 
          there were another even a single other inhabitant, alas. 
What is pain? A man turns and locks his door with exactly the same small 
          dance of hands every morning at the same hour and pockets the key 
          followed by a pat of the pocket with the hand which just locked the 
          door. Unknown to him it is his life, it is the center and source of what 
          he calls his life. It makes him what he is happy to call happy. 
Who suffers? Oh, it is true, there are causes of cruelty, it is that kind of world. 
What is geometry? It is how we know, and what. 
What is the purpose of memory? Blue lines of dust. 
What is the cat when she yawns?   
What is dust?   
Does the child suffer? The child is suffering. 
Is the child cruel? The child crushes the world at will, the child destroys 
          with angelic decorum, the child bleeds into his own drinking water 
          and smiles to see color a demon and delirium the child is born knowing   
          and screaming and there is pain in his fist when he enters and there is   
          pain as if the atoms which whirl mad in their completeness were tiny   
          childbirths and it is the cruelty of children which presses upon the   
          innocent earth and coal turns to diamond. 
What is to perish?   
What is to choose?   
What is to crush?





Chivalric
 

Heraldry and all its lovely language;   
I chose my time there learning 
elsewhere, where else than land,   
Landscape, and how to live, in it 
is not like, nothing is like, the colors 
or the snow, it is not like pearl and   
it is not like the glitter of rainwater 
that darkens the bark against which 
the occasional bloom-laden branch 
might be seen shedding petals. No. 
Here is the past: One was once a boy 
and read books and could not pronounce 
the most engaging words and read 
in silence under blankets. Here   
one was not like oneself or was 
quiet and wrong and did not know 
the words nor how to ask, who 
to ask. Nor why. Boy's books with flags. 
Everyone's born to the language; anyone 
can say something. For instance,   
knight banneret, that's what she called him,   
having no use for him after history,   
she thrust him into the operatic night:   

                                        A woman's hand rose 
above the surface of the lake and caught   
the glistering sword, and slowly   
descended into the boy's refuge,   
his astonishment, so foreign, so little like home 
Knights Baronets--inferior barons formed 
by James I in 1611, the titles were sold 
and the funds went toward the plantation of Ulster. 
For this one would receive the right   
to a Field argent, a sinister hand 
couped the wrist gules. 


                                           How foreign she was   
when God still cared. This is like a life,   
like a history built fluently, as if 
on the innocent, Boy-books and children's   
crusades: The Reading (al-Korn) 
versus The Writing (Scripture). 
Isn't it interesting, east / west, us / them?   
Everyone's born to something.    

                         You should have feared 
the flick of my uncle's thick wrist and 
the boat rides when he took me in those days,   
salt water in the bay and hard slaps against the hull,   
back from a day of horizons, of shrimp nets,   
I would lie on the bow feeling anger against 
my whole boy's body as the engines uttered   
their single syllable for twenty miles back to land,   
a whine more terrible than laughter. 

The oral tradition, a voice hard and horrifying. 
One might have been a chevalier. 
Like someone from the books, was she 
beautiful? Was your mother lovely   
and a kind of landscape herself, like snow 
in dark woods, not like anything else?  

Le plus que lent, my mother would say. 
She'd say, like Debussy 
she would say these things. Me 
and Mom in the kitchen: I should learn 
to waltz, it is a pretty thing to do 
at home, a thing the body does. 
The feet and blood. But mother   
doesn't dance. I make up memories 
but who oh love, you used to   
dance; who'd kiss their hands?





Melting Pot
 

"Who are you to tell us how to live or why, 
et cetera?   No Man, of course, and not so tall   
as is the current fashion, nor smart enough 
in the acceptable modern way, to enthrall 

the crowd with stories of my life among 
the savages where I was home and growing 
baffled day by day, raging through the night 
as if it were new music I made, groaing. 

It came to me today at lunch, the sound 
of women in the next booth, a voice like 
Aunt Odile's--whom I never knew well 
nor did I like her, but not her spite 

but her voice like home-grown fame, a touch 
gravelly, a considerable groan itself, it seemed. 
They spoke outmoded French around me, never 
to me, except to taunt, I thought.   She leaned 

above me, on those visits, speaking to Mother 
in their private French, laughing.   A boy 
surrounded by the sound of foreign tongues 
knowing what wasn't meant for him:   toy 

temptations, suggestive coils of syllables. 
I learned Latin, for Mass, and did love 
its terrific laddered randomness:   
The Blessed hovering Virgin above 

every station of a boy's new path, hormonal 
disharmonies, her praises sung into hundreds 
the first Tuesday of every month: and yet 
Latin could not expose such shreds 

of glittering flesh as I found in French, 
not like the living tongue whose tip twined 
into an Uncle's mustache as he leered 
at the wrong Aunt and winked and a fine 

distance crystallized loud there, then 
gone. Crashing like German. Father's family 
spoke clear English among the bayous, boys 
and girls of immigrants accentless happily 

German through two wars, not counting 
Civil.   I had the tongue for arithmetic 
and spoke it beautifully.   I loved to count:   
precision's a tempting career, clicking 

into a future like an abacus ignoring 
all those accents around. 
I never learned the luck of any 
but English, bland and bound. 

But only yesterday I heard a word 
the mechanic said in Czech 
to his cousin--shop rag--clearly centered 
in a welter of incomprehension, the wreck 

of my car at their wretched mercies:   shop 
rag.   And he wiped his hands and cried   
for me, shrugging like a cousin would. 
I wrote a check. I drove home, or tried. 

So does it count?   Am I a man of passion or 
child of comprehension?   "Father of little lusts 
driving myself home who thinks:   Buy some 
sentiment, a little like love and she must 

speak French this time. She longs 
for you, you know; it isn't just the money. 
America loves you for yourself alone 
and so I go for professional help, honey- 

blond hair and a disposition like 
a happy banker, whose French for dear 
sounds like dog; the cost of living 
is going up, loving her here.





The Center for Atmospheric Research
 

Pei designed the building with views,   
smooth masonry, and the mountains aligned 
for a photo opportunity; inside are files 
sufficient for forever, for fine tuning weather. 

Great Spangled Fritillary, the watcher vaguely recalls 
from Teach Yourself Lepidoptery, a book. 
He wanted to live in a land of appropriate weather 
with views of mountains and with music constant. 

He wants to tell a story but no one would listen, 
like opera: Black women clean the floors 
and shine the walls like silver nightly. 
Computers whir Platonic as nuns. Nothing 

escapes naming; storms arranged in teacups 
like anyone's collection, like rows of butterflies 
pinned and satisfactory: this is the new landscape. 
Or there is a lewd father among the shrubbery 

watching daughters in weather; he breathes heavily 
and the wet wisdom begins, the storm gathering 
to spill across the ridge, longed for. 
Daughters must be warned against sincerity 

of frantic violins: "He was a man of sympathetic   
tendencies, read the official report. "He was 
smaller than he looked and tended to lick chocolate 
from his fingers in a lascivious manner. 

He tried his wife's patience, it is true, 
and lived alone through the marriage, kept 
his own counsel. With such petty symbols as 
weather, he kept his own counsel. 

A butterfly like weather; the climate like 
laughter, the movement of small air. Clouds, too, 
have names. Clouds leave home to find themselves. 
Good money after bad, the fathers say, and close   

the door called Nature against their coming back. 
The funny little ways children have of making 
the world the color they always wanted. Sunset. 
Birds. The mathematics of memory begin 

to swirl like cookie dough, like chocolate with egg 
and sugar and vanilla and butter. A bowl to lick, 
dangerous with delight, as ultraviolet. Home again! 
begs the mother and soon the sorry child walks 

that long alle as rain begins to pour.   Past   
such petty symbols the boy returns through architecture,   
a silly gauntlet: the butterfly, the mother, the fit 
signatures of loveliness. His parents at the door, 

the little cottage in the woods, Hansel home again 
at last, the shining path. A little like a dream. 
Ours is not a simple age, and things are what they seem 
happily ever after in the malicious tiny rain.





Blue Springs
 

As if the sky during its emergence 
--when it bubbled its way up out of the sand, 
cooled and then sublimed into vapor 
that blued the dank grey of the atmosphere-- 
left a residue of cobalt behind to remind 

from where it had sprung into existence, 
the water rising from this spring 
appears unearthly, as only things 
close to earth, born of earth, can:   
its blue deeper than the heart of a sapphire. 

Today, when faced with such a spectacle, 
we have, as usual, only two choices:   
the paralysis of awe, or the quick nonchalance 
of acceptance. But what about the Spaniards   
who came upon this spring before there was 

a platform lined with inner tubes, before 
there were wooden walkways elevated to slow 
their impending rot, before their was a faux beach, 
its sand stolen from the spring's center? 
Did they run in with their clothes on 

convinced that this was  the fountain of youth? 
Did they laugh believing themselves 
drunk, mad, asleep--dead, maybe? 
That afternoon, late summer, we did not swim, 
chose instead to wander out to the edge 

of the walkway, not a word between the two of us, 
only the wind. Unlike us mere mortals, the trees 
had long since been impressed, 
preferring, instead, to maintain postures 
incompatible with the work of sycophants.





Fireweed
 

in memory of amy clampitt 
A single seedling, camp follower 
         of arson... 


Follower of ashes; follower 
of the bleached-out, burned-out 
cascade of buildings, lotfuls 

of whitened soil speckled with debris 
let down by a gutted church 
still aspiring to an ether-blue sky 

centuries gone; follower 
of scripts apotheosized into smoke, 
notes lifted into air by flames 

that all but threatened the entire lane 
with the silence we call a bed 
of dirt; follower of the match, 

the instigator here and abroad, 
the matutinal magnifying glass 
focusing light into unwitting 

summer grass, into cruciform twigs; 
follower of the caveat 
ignored because it was too small; 

follower of the fourth-oldest dream-- 
the landscape burning and burning.





Work Song
 

This fastening, unfastening, and heaving-- 
this is our life. Whose life is it improving? 
It topples some. Some others it will toughen. 
Work is the safest way to fail, and often 
the simplest way to love a son or daughter. 
We come. We carp. We're fired. We worry later. 

That man is strange. His calipers are shiny. 
His hands are black. For lunch he brings baloney, 
and, offered coffee, answers, "Thank you, no.
That man, with nothing evil left to do 
and two small skills to stir some interest up, 
fits in the curtained corner of a shop. 

The best part of our life is disappearing 
into the john to sneak a smoke, or staring 
at screaming non-stop mills, our eyes unfocused, 
or standing judging whose sick joke is sickest. 
Yet nothing you could do could break our silence. 
We are a check. Do not expect a balance. 

That is a wrathful man becoming older, 
a nobody like us, turned mortgage holder. 
We stay until the bell. That man will stay 
ten minutes more, so no one can complain. 
Each day, by then, he's done exactly ten. 
Ten what, exactly, no one here can say.





The Theory 0f Hats
 

It is hard even to admit this theory of hats, that to wear 
The faithless one brimmed tightly over the eyes-- 
The featherless and discreet one, a hat with a secret code 
That says, To spoil the child is to fatten the serpent-- 
To wear that hat (imperfectly as a crow's crown) against the sun 
Is to bear the ruins of the unborn into our hearts-- 
He, shouting at the brunt of trees; 
She, shifting like a seer to restore them. 
It is hard to know happiness with a hat like that. 
Or to forget the pangs sung with such burly impatience, 
Or to heal the blurred things and soft hurts. 
Even the blind self becomes a dervish, what with the torsion 
And the far-off vita nuova like a new virus or virtuoso, 
What with the tussles and old, pure-lit suppressions. 
Then to be surprised by joy: Like the last rain of summer, 
The big, spiraling, wounded animal of rain 
With no place to turn, drumming the brown grass, 
Rain falling without meaning, but perfectly faithful, 
Into the petals of wind and the unopened roots-- 
Such tenderness looked to, like love, but unquestioned. 
Then some afternoon with the sky lifting off again, 
She will come to sit on the porch like a dark sparrow 
And let the sun creep slowly onto her hair 
And grow old and wonder about the balance of things. 
And he beside her, sitting, too, distracted in the sun for hours, 
But all the same, both of them, at last, so much warmer.





Marvel
 

I did not call to the Holy Spirit or whistle My lordy, lordy, 
Nor hum one scintilla of shame. What hid in the grass 
Was neither skiver nor savior, neither cheater nor ace. 
Besides, the doves peering over the gutters have all gone awry. 
If I'm only a man, born far from a boomer's shack-- 
Hoarding sawbucks, cherry-picking the hicks like prey, 
And the wusses, and the Horacian declaimers, and the lucky 
Grubbers who master heartache and lurk like crooks 
Among the rich and the rebadged--then I'm a rival devil, 
Carrying my brag like a brakeman. And the one certainty, 
That life is to be lost--and no matter the opinion, someone's 
Always a fool--has me rubbed inside like a lonely breed 
With the swill edgy and chic and rough. Who asks: 
Who needs a cotton-eyed hymn to say what the old shanty   
By the track has meant to the human story? Or: 
What's Heaven for? The reach and grasp, the pecked-at days, 
The horsey blues that lilac after hours, 
The rocks I've carried in my coat pocket-- 
None of it has me shuddering on my knees. 
Nevertheless, I marvel at the pigs and the ducks, at dogs and kings, 
And revive this peck of flame, this tongue of lack, too easily.





Silent Prophet
 

It's the last day, but I'm keeping the news to myself. 
If yesterday it made sense for letter carriers 
To carry letters from door to door, 
The job still ought to be worth doing. 
Why tell what I know and risk a walkout? 
Let firefighters race to the last fire. 
Let platoons of police set up their last lines 
So the factions that come to the demonstration 
Do battle only in words and gestures. 

The day is different, but only for me, 
Knowing as I do that it offers the last chance 
For a cautious investor to resist his nature enough 
To back a grocery in a battered district, 
And the last chance for the would-be grocers 
To open a bottle of good champagne 
In the kitchen of the friend who's led them 
Through the small-print maze of the application. 
And now they're toasting the months to come 
Scheduled to move the project along 
From drawing blueprints to cutting ribbons. 
Shall I tell them their expectations are dreams 
If the dreams impart to the day contour and substance? 

Though silent, I'm rooting for them to let the day 
Expand to include the days to be denied them. 
And I hope that the friend who's pouring 
A final round in his kitchen isn't disturbed 
As his small apartment fills with the sound 
Of squeaking from across the hall, though yesterday 
He banged on his neighbor's door for quiet. 
It's his last chance to endorse a woman 
Bent on learning from scratch to play the viola, 
To respect her for finding an hour a day for practice, 
As if raising two sons alone 
And teaching civics at a high school 
Not renowned for civility weren't enough. 

Should I sit on a stone and lament 
That the day is her last if it still contains, 
Scrolled up within it, the years she'll need 
To master the art of voicing feelings 
Not now expressed, at home or in class, 
About the distance between the world 
She'd like to inhabit and the world she does? 

Some other prophet, convinced the future 
Depends on the flow of time to give it substance, 
May decide to speak out. I'm keeping silent 
As one of her sons sits at his desk 
Dividing a page into reasons for leaving home 
And reasons for staying. Now on this last day 
It seems that home is best defined as any region 
On earth that has much to teach him, 
And now as the region fit to receive the most 
Of whatever he'll have to offer 
After he learns where his talents lie.





Trout
 

I do my best 
to keep pointlessness 
at bay. But here, 
wet above my 
knees, I let it fly. 
Here, hot and cold, 
fingers thick with 
thinking, I try to 
tie the fly and look 
for the net, loosening 
the philosophical   
knot of why I came 
here today, not yet 
knowing whether 
I'll free or fry 
the rainbows 
and browns once 
they're mine.





Prof of Profs
 

For Allison Hogge, in memory of Brian Wilkie
I was a math major--fond of all things rational. 
It was the first day of my first poetry class. 
The prof, with the air of a priest at Latin mass, 
told us that we could "make great poetry personal,

could own it, since poetry we memorize sings 
inside us always. By way of illustration 
he began reciting Shelley with real passion, 
but stopped at "Ozymandias, King of Kings; 

Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!-- 
because, with that last plosive, his top denture 
popped from his mouth and bounced off an empty chair. 

He blinked, then offered, as postscript to his lecture,   
a promise so splendid it made me give up math: 
"More thingth like that will happen in thith clath.





My Moses
 

Big Jack and his walking stick 
live on the ridge. Navajo 
orphan kids dance for him, 
bobcat urine's in the weeds, 
the shotgun barrel's up his sleeve,   
a Persian coin is on the wind.   
The Chinese Mountains smell the moon 
and arch their backs. I tell him, Jack, 
there's times I wish I was living in 
canvas France, the old west, 
a picture book, the Sea of 
Tranquility, or even in   
the den near the hot spring. 
He says, kid, to hell with 

phantom limbs; spring is a verb, 
a wish is a wash, a walking stick   
is a gottdam wing.





The Storm Is Over
 

But now it's raining 
below the greener clouds 
of trees that were absorbent 
but only up to a point. 
And these raindrops 
strained by treetops 
should (you would think) 
be filtered and finer 
and therefore pure 
(and not Chinese 
water torture's 
fatter, darker drops 
that always pick out 
of all possible bull's-eyes 
your bald spot). 
But these are late, last drops 
and a little bloated 
like late, last poems 
by name your poet.





Soft Spots
 

They're worse than weak links 
in chains, which we can blame 
on blacksmiths' fire, and chinks 
in armor, made by rain 

of arrows. Soft spots, 
those parts of us that bruise, 
prove we're fruit that rots 
as hourglasses ooze. 

But I've a soft spot for, 
a phrase we tend to whisper, 
is what we say before 
we name our guilty pleasure-- 

the damper pedal that pounds 
sonatas into mush 
the critic Ezra Pound 
would call, with a shudder, slush.





Alchemy
 

Heifetz's Decca recordings show him doing what he did best: transforming two- and three-minute trifles into works of perfection.--John Maltese
Imperfect things are always-- 
it seems--a wave 
of some wand away 
from perfection. 
They're there--the toady 
and the bumpy 
with warts--for turning   
into princes. Even pumpkins-- 
propped upon 
piles of lumber-- 
idle like unupholstered 
carriages up on cinder 
blocks. But a trifle's potential-- 
its capacity for alchemy, actually-- 
can leave you longing 
for lead. So many things 
you think are Prince Hals 
are really just kings.





Marble-Sized Song
 

Does she love you? She says yes, but really 
how do you know unless you undress that easy assertion, 
undoing its petals and laminae, and going in 
below all trace of consciousness, into the neuroelectrical 
coffer where self-understanding is storaged away, 
and then lifting its uttermost molecule out, to study 
in its nakedness as it spins 
in a clinical light?--the way 
we all, in our various individual versions 
of this common human urge, go in, 
and in, and in, the physicist down 
to the string-vibration underlying matter, and   
the Appalachia fiddler getting so 
(as she puts it) "into my music, sound becomes 
a flesh for her to intimately ("in-timately) 
enter, "its thick and its sweetbreads.
Is he cheating on you? He says no, and feigns 
that he's insulted, but for certainty 
you'll need to delicately strip the bark away 
and drill, and tweeze, until you can smear a microscope slide 
of the pith and can augur the chitterlings 
--the way the philosopher can't accept a surface 
assumption of truth, but needs to peel back   
the fatty sheen of the dermis, soak the cambium layer 
into a blow-away foam, and then with pick 
and lightbeam helmet, inch by inch begin 
spelunking through those splayed-out caverns 
under the crust, where gems of cogitation are buried 
--the way the diver descends for the pearl, 
the miner: in, the archaeologist: in, the therapist: down 
the snakier roots of us and in, and in, the way 
the lone, leg-pretzeled yogi makes 
a glowing bathysphere of worldliness and sends it in, 
and further in, tinier and heavier and ever in, 
the way the man in the opium den is floating forever, 
toward a horizon positioned in the center of the center 
of his head. . . . If we could stand beyond the border 
of our species and consider us objectively, it might seem 
that our purpose in existing is to be a living agency 
that balances, or maybe even slows, the universe's 
irreversible expansion out, and out . . . and each 
of us, a contribution to that task. 
My friend John's wife received the news: a "growth, 
a "mass, on her pituitary, marble-sized, mysterious. 
And the primary-care physician said: Yes, 
we must go in and in. That couldn't be the final word! 
And the second-opinion physician said: Yes, 
my sweet-and-shivering-one, 
my fingerprint-and-irisprint-uniqueness, 
someone's-dearest, you 
who said the prayers at Juliette's grave, who drove 
all night from Switzerland with your daughter, you 
on this irreplaceable day in your irreplaceable skin 
in the scumbled light as it crosses the bay in Corpus Christi, 
yes in the shadows, yes in the radiance, 
yes we must go in and in.





Philosopher Orders Crispy Pork
 

I love him so, this creature I do pray 
was treated kindly. I will pay 
as much as pig-lovers see fit 

to guarantee him that. As for his fat,   
I'd give up years yes years of my   
own life for such 

a gulpable semblable.   
(My life! Such as it is! This 
liberality of leaves! The world 

won't need those seventeen more 
poems, after all, there being 
so few subjects to be treated. Three 

if by subject we mean anyone 
submitted to another's 
will. Two if by subject we mean   

topic. One if by death we wind up 
meaning love. And none if a subject   
must entail 

the curlicue's indulgence of itself.)





Dark View
 

The sun that puts its spokes in every 
Wheel of manhandle and tree 

Derives its path of seashines 
(Sheer centrifugality) from my 

Regards. I send it 
My regards. Some yards 

Of lumen from the fabrika 
Have come unbolted from the look 

Of it (or likes of me), a long 
Unweaving or recarding I 

Cannot recall begun, and there 
Before my eyes a palm 

Puts lashes round the sun.





A Lock of Her Hair
 

As a hoodoo-voodoo, get-you-back-to-me tool, 
this hank's thankless task is vast, 
a head down to the ground impossibility, possibly, 
since what I'm thinking of is your toe pad pinknesses too, 
your soup hots and round-and-rounds, the fine 
and perfect poundage of you on my paws, the very cause 
and problem I moan and bemoan 
the absence of. For Love, above the head 
this reddish coil once lavishly wore, there's an air so far away 
it's sad for me to even think the same sun's rays play 
where it was and do to you what I would do 
if I were there or you were here. Still, some thrills 
remembered do resemble thrills, one hopes, and the ropes 
of it that gently fell around me bound me so well 
no hell of miles can defile this dream I dream. I mean 
the anyway DNA I can find of you. I mean the home 
of bones and blood that holds the whole of you 
and which this fizzed-up missive means to conjure, missy, 
my world in a curl, girl, this man oh man half man I am 
when you're gone.





Song That Can Only Be Sung Once
 

After Porfirio Barba Jacob's Cancin De La Vida Profunda
Variable, changeable, yes, there are days when 
people like us are like that. Maybe under   

some other sky something like glory smiles on us,   
maybe there life is clear, maybe there things open up   

on the way the sea stretches out to the horizon-- 
but us, we're blown by chance the way wind blows 

blades of grass lightly blowing them all one way. 


And then there are days when we feel April, 
the fields of April making us feel our bodies 

longing to be held and fucked into oblivion, 
bodies fertile as a field in April, swollen,   

trembling to be touched: and under the influences 
of rains pouring down as if pure spirit poured 

into us like rain, that thing called "soul 
sprouts and branches and entangles us 

in lush bowers and thickets of illusion. 


Oh yes, days come along when we're calm, clear 
--childhood sunsets, lagoons rippling sapphire!-- 

days when a verse, a sudden whistle, days when a mountain   
and bird passing over it, days when even our own pain 

and what we feel it to be like make us smile. 
And sure, there are days when we're so   
disgusting, so sordid to ourselves 

it's like we're dark stone in the darkness   
inside flint: then nighttime surprises us,   

its lamplight dizzying, cold, profuse, glinting   
off tossed coins of the good, the terrible 

shining with the gleam of that primal metal. 


And other days come, come when women 
want to cry their come cries and use us   

as their own, days when we're itching to get   
a woman naked, and then we can't face it, can't   

stand it somehow, they want us but we don't know   
how to want them back: arm tightening around   

a waist, hand cupping a breast, we don't dare   
touch the roundness of an apple or a pear, 

the round earth spins us off into space. 


And then there arrive days so dismal and stupefied 
and numb that the idiot soughing of a pine grove 

sounds like weeping: and what some idiot called 
the soul whines and wails and carries on 

with what some other idiot calls "the pain of the world: 
and maybe not God himself, that absolute fool, 
can make that wind less cutting, or make it stop. 


And then there comes, certain to come, oh my earth 
I love beyond any of my days, a day . . . a day . . . a day 

when my sail catches the wind and drags the anchor 
up out of the bottom muck, and nothing can withstand 

that wind blowing by, talking to itself, talking, talking . . .   
and the day is mine and yours and every living thing's . . .   

the day when nobody and nothing can keep us 
from getting up and going, no matter who we are . . . 

the day when our leaving is the same as our arriving.





A Duet
 

Art was long. 
Paul was short. 
Art sang the song. 
Paul was the sort 

who made one up 
as if from air. 
Paul had more gift. 
Art had more hair-- 

which isn't to take 
away from Arts. 
Many sing well 
if someone starts, 

and it robs no Simon 
to get paid like Paul. 
Along was Art's way 
to be singing at all. 

If Paul robbed some, 
it's harder revealing. 
What stuck in his mind, 
he stuck to concealing 

so koo-koo-ka-choo 
would stick in our heads. 
It wasn't Garfunkel, 
someone said Simon said 

when they parted acts. 
Debts one forgets. 
Acoustic is fraught 
with strings over frets, 

taken together, 
taken apart. 
Paul lifting from life.   
Life lifting from Art.





A Shopkeepers Story
 

I sell one bristle brushes. People 
seeking two bristle brushes I send 
to the guy on Amsterdam, who's in a rush. 

I may have one customer a year 
for my one bristle brushes, a one-eyed 
lover of tanagers, she may have 

one dollar to spend in the moment 
light's neither day's or night's, 
but one's where infinity begins. Whoever 

she is, she's always painting barbules, 
I'm always thinking, no one will notice 
that they notice this, that her tanagers 

move, that everything's alive. We talk 
care and feeding of the one 
bristle brush. Care exists. I thrive.





Explaining It
 

In the woods off Ivory, just out of car-shot 
it's not enough to say a mouse lies snug 

in a crib of roots, its fur sleek as babyskin, 
Lord the body warm. Too often a name 

subverts the pang it answers for, inwit of   
heart-light, the epiphanic clutch. I mean 

do you sense with more than a chill the tiny 
homely lumpliness of it there in the dirt 

as you orphan the dim of a cold October 
sun, no wound I can find anywhere 

on its, your, my small soft bodykins--yikes 
its left ear (the inner skin pink 

delicate svelte) twitches a little 
and I have this before thought tricks it 

whimsically lovely wink of the soul as 
mouse-force taking wing until the O-no 

letdown when a yellow jacket backs out, 
O sweetmeat funk and dandle of the brain 

asputter as it launches over frost-curled leaves 
and dollarweed seed strewn on the path 

like medallions glimpsed the second we-- 
I mean all of us cold in the twilight--fly.





Old Smile at the Roast
 

Test for the Old Smile, they're going to roast it-- 
it'll have to keep its ends up all night, 
for the secretary says she finds it creepy, 
and the golfing partner says you got that right, 

and the rival says it's fake, and the ambitious 
junior makes his point with a few slides, 
and the protege the Smile was always sweet to 
walks up and says it turns his insides. 

They harp on it, the bosses and the buddies, 
and things get even better by these lights, 
which is to say it's shredded like a secret, 
which is to say it's one of the great nights; 

and folks are saying so while they're still roasting: 
they cry out to the Smile and it smiles back, 
like something huge is burdening a hammock, 
or is until you hear a frightful crack.-- 

And then you better run like you saw nothing. 
And then you better run like you weren't there. 
There is a line, it's long and isn't smiling. 
You won't believe me when I tell you where.





Psalm
 

For you are like their parent 
                                       who is never pleased 
                  and they are like your parent 
                                                            who cannot stay angry 

For you are like a child 

For age after age 
                                       they conceive you 
                  and despite the pain of birth 
                                                            they bring you forth 

For they call you perfect   
                                       though your hands are missing 
                  and though your heart does not beat 
                                                            they give you a name 

For they remember you 

For they hold you blameless 
                                       in their sorrow 
                  though they were surely happiest 
                                                            before you arrived 

For your identical twin 
                                       they name Silence 
                  and when they feed Silence 
                                                            he grows 

For they love Silence 
                                       as they would have loved you 
                  even more perhaps 
                                                            as old age comes 
and they forget 
                                       the sound of your cry 
                  and where the exact spot was 
                                                            they spread your ashes 

and how those ashes 
                                       tasted 
                  when the wind blew them 
                                                            into their mouths 

Father in their dreams 
                                       they worry still 
                  perhaps it is you 
                                                            who lives among them 

and not Silence 
                                       after all   
                  mistakes happen 
                                                            after all 

how would anyone know 

and the midwives 
                                       forgive them 
                  forgive them 
                                                            were only human





The Breather
 

Just as in the horror movies 
when someone discovers that the phone calls 
are coming from inside the house 

so too, I realized   
that our tender overlapping 
has been taking place only inside me. 

All that sweetness, the love and desire-- 
it's just been me dialing myself 
then following the ringing to another room 

to find no one on the line, 
well, sometimes a little breathing 
but more often than not, nothing. 

To think that all this time-- 
which would include the boat rides, 
the airport embraces, and all the drinks-- 

it's been only me and the two telephones, 
the one on the wall in the kitchen 
and the extension in the darkened guest room upstairs.





My Hair
 

When I gather my long 
leaf-colored hair 
and make of it a stem 

and twist the handle of my head 
and join it back to me 
with metal pins 

I'm on your lap again 
my hands are in the air 
my view is mile upon mile 

I feel you fashioning the serpent 
on my head and the thick braid 
of you inside me 

I'm ready now to enter 
a prim public place 
where I am the teacher the police a saint 

I turn my back 
and everyone I command 
sees what it can be to be commanded





Selected Recent and New Errors
 

My books are full of mistakes 
but not the ones Tony's always pointing out 
as if correct spelling is what could stop the conveyor belt 
the new kid caught his arm in. 
Three weeks on the job and he's already six hundred 
legal pages, lawyers haggling in an office 
with an ignored view of the river 
pretending to be asleep, pretending 
to have insight into its muddy self. 
You think that's a fucked-up, drawn-out metaphor, 
try this: if you feel you're writhing like a worm 
in a bottle of tequila, you don't know 
it's the quickness of its death that reveals 
the quality of the product, its proof. 
I don't know what I'm talking about either. 
Do you think the dictionary ever says to itself 
I've got these words that mean completely 
different things inside myself 
and it's tearing me apart? 
My errors are even bigger than that. 
You start taking down the walls of your house, 
sooner or later it'll collapse 
but not before you can walk around 
with your eyes closed, rolled backwards 
and staring straight into the amygdala's meatlocker 
and your own damn self hanging there. 
Do that for awhile and it's easier to delight   
in snow that lasts about twenty minutes 
longer than a life held together 
by the twisted silver baling wire 
of deception and stealth. 
But I ain't confessing nothing. 
On mornings when I hope you forget my name, 
I walk through the high wet weeds 
that don't have names either. 
I do not remember the word dew. 
I do not remember what I told you 
with your ear in my teeth. 
Further and further into the weeds. 
We have absolutely no proof 
god isn't an insect 
rubbing her hind legs together to sing. 
Or boring into us like a yellow jacket 
into a fallen, overripe pear. 
Or an assassin bug squatting over us, 
shoving a proboscis right through 
our breast plate then sipping. 
How wonderful our poisons don't kill her.





The Play of Light and Shadow
 

We want to give ourselves away utterly 
but afterwards we resent it, it is the same 
with the sparrows, their eyes burn so coldly 
under the dusty pines, their small chests swell 
as they dispute a crumb, or the empty place 
where a seed was once: this is our law too, 
to peck and peck at the Self, to take turns 
being I, to die in a fierce sidelong glance, 
then to hold the entire forest in one tilt 
of a tufted head, to take flight suddenly 
and fuck in midair, tumbling upward.





Thistles
 

stand as clocks fully struck 
in fields of fading flowers-- 
when the fires of summer come 
they will gather up the hours 
of rains past, frost endured 

and famished stalks in full gale 
that begin their telling once 
all forms of telling fail





Biology
 

Is this happiness or oyster-life? 
This flexing of muscular torso-foot 
joy's wonder? This sifting of silt   
from food in the shifting chill-dark? 
If, in my mind, there is a life of flight 
in the light beyond the over-swirl, 
must I unfix my lips from this rock 
to be right? Or is my apex to worry 
quartz against my shell?





"Any fool can get into an ocean . . .
 

Any fool can get into an ocean   
But it takes a Goddess   
To get out of one. 
What's true of oceans is true, of course, 
Of labyrinths and poems. When you start swimming   
Through riptide of rhythms and the metaphor's seaweed 
You need to be a good swimmer or a born Goddess 
To get back out of them 
Look at the sea otters bobbing wildly 
Out in the middle of the poem 
They look so eager and peaceful playing out there where the 
    water hardly moves 
You might get out through all the waves and rocks 
Into the middle of the poem to touch them 
But when you've tried the blessed water long 
Enough to want to start backward 
That's when the fun starts 
Unless you're a poet or an otter or something supernatural 
You'll drown, dear. You'll drown 
Any Greek can get you into a labyrinth 
But it takes a hero to get out of one 
What's true of labyrinths is true of course 
Of love and memory. When you start remembering.





[Response to the Loyalty Oath]
 

          
             We, the Research Assistants and Teaching Assistants of the University of California, wish to register our protest against the new loyalty oath for the following reasons.

1) The testing of a University faculty by oath is a stupid and insulting procedure. If this oath is to have the effect of eliminating Communists from the faculty, we might as logically eliminate murderers from the faculty by forcing every faculty member to sign an oath saying that he has never committed murder.

2) That such an oath is more dangerous to the liberties of the community than any number of active Communists should be obvious to any student of history. Liberty and democracy are more often overthrown by fear than by stealth. Only countries such as Russia or Spain have institutions so weak and unhealthy that they must be protected by terror.

3) Oaths and other forms of blackmail are destructive to the free working of man's intellect. Since the early Middle Ages universities have zealously guarded their intellectual freedom and have made use of its power to help create the world we know today. The oath that Galileo was forced by the Inquisition to swear is but a distant cousin to the oath we are asked to swear today, but both represent the struggle of the blind and powerful against the minds of free men.

   We, who will inherit the branches of learning that one thousand years of free universities have helped to generate, are not Communists and dislike the oath for the same reason we dislike Communism. Both breed stupidity and indignity; both threaten our personal and intellectual freedom.
                                                                         [c. 1949]
        




A Second Train Song for Gary
 

When the trains come into strange cities

The citizens come out to meet the strangers.

                                        I love you, Jack, he said

                                        I love you, Jack, he said

                                        At another station.

When passengers come in from strange cities

The citizens come out to help the strangers.

                                        I love you too, I said

                                        I love you too, I said

                                        From another station.

The citizens are kind to passing strangers

And nourish them and kiss their lips in kindness.

                                        I walk the unbelieving streets

                                        I walk the unbelieving streets

                                        In a strange city.

At night in cold new beds the welcomed strangers

Achieve in memory the city's promise.

                                        I wake in love with you

                                        I wake in love with you

                                        At last year's station.

Then say goodbye to citizens and city

Admit this much--that they were kind to strangers.

                                        I leave my love with you

                                        I leave my love with you

                                        In this strange city.





[Letter to Gary Bottone]
 

          
          Dear Gary,     Somehow your letter was no surprise (and I think you knew that it was no surprise or you would have tried to break the news more gently); somehow I think we understand what the other is going to say long before we say it--a proof of love and, I think, a protection against misunderstanding. So I've been expecting this letter for five weeks now--and I still don't know how to answer it.     Bohemia is a dreadful, wonderful place. It is full of hideous people and beautiful poetry. It is a hell full of windows into heaven. It would be wrong of me to drag a person I love into such a place against his will. Unless you walk into it freely, and with open despairing eyes, you can't even see the windows. And yet I can't leave Bohemia myself to come to you--Bohemia is inside of me, in a sense is me, was the price I paid, the oath I signed to write poetry.     I think that someday you'll enter Bohemia--not for me (I'm not worth the price, no human being is), but for poetry--to see the windows and maybe blast a few yourself through the rocks of hell. I'll be there waiting for you, my arms open to receive you.     But let's have these letters go on, whether it be days, years, or never before I see you. We can still love each other although we cannot see each other. We will be no farther apart when I'm in Berkeley than we were when I was in Minneapolis. And we can continue to love each other, by letter, from alien worlds.      Love,    Jack                                                                      [c.1951-2]
        




"Imagine Lucifer . . .
 

Imagine Lucifer 
An angel without angelness 
An apple 
Plucked clear by will of taste, color, 
Strength, beauty, roundness, seed 
Absent of all God painted, present everything 
An apple is. 
Imagine Lucifer 
An angel without angelness 
A poem 
That has revised itself out of sound 
Imagine, rhyme, concordance 
Absent of all God spoke of, present everything 
A poem is. 
                            The law I say, the Law 
Is? 
What is Lucifer 
An emperor with no clothes 
No skin, no flesh, no heart 
An emperor!





A Poem For Dada Day At The Place April 1, 1958
 

I 
The bartender 
Has eyes the color of ripe apricots 
Easy to please as a cash register he 
Enjoys art and good jokes. 
Squish 
Goes the painting 
Squirt 
Goes the poem 
He 
We 
Laugh. 

II 
It is not easy to remember that other people died 
          besides Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker 
Died looking for beauty in the world of the 
          bartender 
This person, that person, this person, that person 
          died looking for beauty 
Even the bartender died 

III   
Dante blew his nose 
And his nose came off in his hand 
Rimbaud broke his throat 
Trying to cough 
Dada is not funny 
It is a serious assault 
On art 
Because art 
Can be enjoyed by the bartender. 

IV 
The bartender is not the United States 
Or the intellectual 
Or the bartender 
He is every bastard that does not cry 
When he reads this poem.





Five Poems From "Helen: A Revision
 

Nothing is known about Helen but her voice 
Strange glittering sparks 
Lighting no fires but what is reechoed 
Rechorded, set on the icy sea. 

All history is one, as all the North Pole is one 
Magnetic, music to play with, ice 
That has had to do with vision 
And each one of us, naked. 
Partners. Naked. 

*       *       * 

Helen: A Revision 
ZEUS: It is to be assumed that I do not exist while most people in the vision assume that I do exist. This is to be one of the extents of meaning between the players and the audience. I have to talk like this because I am the lord of both kinds of sky--and I don't mean your sky and their sky because they are signs, I mean the bright sky and the burning sky. I have no intention of showing you my limits. The players in this poem are players. They have taken their parts not to deceive you [or me for that matter] but because they have been paid in love or coin to be players. I have known for a long time that there is not a fourth wall in a play. I am called Zeus and I know this. 

THERSITES: [Running out on the construction of the stage.] The fourth wall is not as important as you think it is. 

ZEUS: [Disturbed but carrying it off like a good Master of Ceremonial.] Thersites is involuntary. [He puts his arm around him.] I could not play a part if I were not a player. 

THERSITES: Reveal yourself to me and don't pretend that there are people watching you. I am alone on the stage with you. Tell me the plot of the play. 

ZEUS: [Standing away.] Don't try to talk if you don't have to. You must admit there is no audience. Everything is done for you. 

THERSITES: Stop repeating yourself. You old motherfucker. Your skies are bad enough. [He looks to the ground.] A parody is better than a pun. 

ZEUS: I do not understand your language. 

[They are silent together for a moment and then the curtain drops.] 


*       *       * 

And if he dies on this road throw wild blackberries at his ghost 
And if he doesn't, and he won't, hope the cost 
Hope the cost. 

And the tenor of the what meets the why at the edge 
Like a backwards image of each terror's lodge 
Each terror's lodge. 

And if he cries put his heart out with a lantern's goat 
Where they say all passages to pay the debt 
The lighted yet. 


*       *       * 

The focus sing 
Is not their business. Their backs lay 
By not altogether being there. 
Here and there in swamps and villages. 
How doth the silly crocodile 
Amuse the Muse 

*       *       * 

And in the skyey march of flesh 
That boundary line where no body is 
Preserve us, lord, from aches and harms 
And bring my death. 

Both air and water rattle there 
And mud and fire 
Preserve us, lord, from what would share a shroud 
and bring my death. 

A vagrant bird flies to the glossy limbs 
The battlefield has harms. The trees have half 
Their branches shot away. Preserve us, lord 
From hair and mud and flesh.

For the Consideration of Poets
 

where is the poetry of resistance, 
                     the poetry of honorable defiance 
unafraid of lies from career politicians and business men, 
not respectful of journalist who write 
official speak void of educated thought 
without double search or sub surface questions 
that war talk demands? 
where is the poetry of doubt and suspicion 
not in the service of the state, bishops and priests, 
not in the service of beautiful people and late night promises, 
not in the service of influence, incompetence and academic 
         clown talk?





Rwanda: Where Tears Have No Power
 

Who has the moral high ground? 

Fifteen blocks from the whitehouse 
on small corners in northwest, d.c. 
boys disguised as me rip each other's hearts out 
with weapons made in china. they fight for territory. 

across the planet in a land where civilization was born 
the boys of d.c. know nothing about their distant relatives 
in Rwanda. they have never heard of the hutu or tutsi people. 
their eyes draw blanks at the mention of kigali, byumba 
or butare. all they know are the streets of d.c., and do not 
cry at funerals anymore. numbers and frequency have a way 
of making murder commonplace and not news 
unless it spreads outside of our house, block, territory. 

modern massacres are intraethnic. bosnia, sri lanka, burundi, 
nagorno-karabakh, iraq, laos, angola, liberia, and rwanda are 
small foreign names on a map made in europe. when bodies 
by the tens of thousands float down a river turning the water 
the color of blood, as a quarter of a million people flee barefoot 
into tanzania and zaire, somehow we notice. we do not smile, 
we have no more tears. we hold our thoughts. In deeply 
muted silence looking south and thinking that today 
nelson mandela seems much larger 
than he is.





Quality: Gwendolyn Brooks at 73
 

June 7, 1990
breath, 
life after seven decades plus three years 
is a lot of breathing. seventy three years on this 
earth is a lot of taking in and giving out, is a 
life of coming from somewhere and for many a bunch 
of going nowhere. 

how do we celebrate a poet who has created 
music with words for over fifty years, who has 
showered magic on her people, who has redefined 
poetry into a black world exactness 
thereby giving the universe an insight into 
darkroads? 

just say she interprets beauty and wants to 
give life, say she is patient with phoniness 
and doesn't mind people calling her gwen or sister. 
say she sees the genius in our children, is visionary 
about possibilities, sees as clearly as ray charles and 
stevie wonder, hears like determined elephants looking 
for food. say that her touch is fine wood, her memory 
is like an african roadmap detailing adventure and 
clarity, yet returning to chicago's south evans 
to record the journey. say her voice is majestic 
and magnetic as she speaks in poetry, rhythms, song 
and spirited trumpets, say she is dark skinned, 
melanin rich, small-boned, hurricane-willed, 
with a mind like a tornado redefining the landscape. 

life after seven decades plus three years 
is a lot of breathing. 
gwendolyn, gwen, sister g has 
not disappointed our expectations. 
in the middle 
of her eldership she brings us 
vigorous language, memory, 
illumination. 

she brings breath.





The Window, at the Moment of Flame
 

And all this while I have been playing with toys 
A toy power station a toy automobile a house of blocks 

And all this while far off in other lands 
Thousands and thousands, millions and millions-- 

You know--you see the pictures 
Women carrying their bony infants 

Men sobbing over graves 
Buildings sculpted by explosion 

Earth wasted bare and rotten-- 
And all this while I have been shopping, I have 

Been let us say free 
And do they hate me for it 

Do they hate me





Daffodils
 

--for David Lehman   Ten thousand saw I at a glance  Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.  --William Wordsworth   Going to hell so many times tears it  Which explains poetry.  --Jack Spicer 
The day the war against Iraq begins 
I'm photographing the yellow daffodils 
With their outstretched arms and ruffled cups 
Blowing in the wind of Jesus Green 

Edging the lush grassy moving river 
Along with the swans and ducks 
Under a soft March Cambridge sky 
Embellishing the earth like a hand 

Starting to illustrate a children's book 
Where people in light clothes come out 
To play, to frisk and run about 
With their lovers, friends, animals, and children 

As down every stony back road of history 
They've always done in the peaceful springs 
--Which in a sense is also hell because 
The daffodils do look as if they dance 

And make some of us in the park want to dance 
And breathe deeply and I know that 
Being able to eat and incorporate beauty like this 
I am privileged and by that token can 

Taste pain, roll it on my tongue, it's good 
The cruel wars are good the stupidity is good, 
The primates hiding in their caves are very good, 
They do their best, which explains poetry. 

What explains poetry is that life is hard 
But better than the alternatives, 
The no and the nothing. Look at this light 
And color, a splash of brilliant yellow 

Punctuating an emerald text, white swans 
And mottled brown ducks floating quietly along 
Whole and alive, like an untorn language 
That lacks nothing, that excludes 

Nothing. Period. Don't you think 
It is our business to defend it 
Even the day our masters start a war? 
To defend the day we see the daffodils?





At Eighty-three She Lives Alone
 

Enclosure, steam-heated; a trial casket. 
You are here; your name on a postal box; 
entrance into another place like vapor. 
No one knows you. No one speaks to you. 
All of their cocks stare down their pant legs 
at the ground. Their cunts are blind. They 
barely let you through the check-out line. 
Have a nice day. Plastic or paper? 

Are you origami? A paper folded swan, 
like the ones you made when you were ten? 
When you saw the constellations, lying 
on your back in the wet grass, 
the soapy pear blossoms drifting 
and wasting, and those stars, the burned out ones 
whose light was still coming in waves; 
your body was too slight. 
How could it hold such mass? 
Still on your lips the taste of something. 

All night you waited for morning, all morning 
for afternoon, all afternoon for night; 
and still the longing sings. 
Oh, paper bird with folded wings.





The Pennacesse Leper Colony for Women, Cape Cod: 1922
 

for Laura
The island, you mustn't say, had only rocks and scrub pine; 
Was on a blue, bright day like a blemish in this landscape. 
And Charlotte who is frail and the youngest of us collects 
Sticks and branches to start our fires, cries as they burn 
Because they resemble most what she has lost 
Or has little of: long fingers, her toes, 
And a left arm gone past the elbow, soon clear to her shoulder. 
She has the mouth of sea perch. Five of our sisters wear 
Green hoods. You are touched by all of this, but not by us. 
To be touched by us, to be kissed! Sometimes 
We see couples rowing in the distance in yellow coats. 

Sometimes they fish with handlines; we offend 
Everyone who is offended most 
And by everything and everyone. The five goats love us, though, 
And live in our dark houses. When they are 
Full with milk they climb the steps and beg that 
They be milked. Their teats brush the steps and leave thick 
Yellow trails of fresh milk. We are all females here. 
Even the ghosts. We must wash, of course, in salt water, 
But it smarts or maybe even hurts us. Often with a rope 
Around her waist Anne is lowered entirely into the water. 
She splashes around and screams in pain. Her screams 
Sometimes carry clear to the beaches on the Cape. 

For us I say so often. For us we say. For us! We are 
Human and not individual, we hold everything in common. 
We are individual, you could pick us out in a crowd. 
You did. This island is not our prison. We are not kept 
In; not even by our skin. 

Once Anne said she would love to be a Negro or a trout. 

We live without you. Father, I don't know why I have written 
You all this; but be proud for I am living, and yet each day 
I am less and less your flesh. Someday, eventually, you 
Should only think of me as being a lightning bug on the lawn, 
Or the Negro fishing at the pond, or the fat trout he wraps 
In leaves that he is showing to someone. I'll be 

Most everything for you. And I'll be gone.





Her Monologue of Dark Crepe with Edges of Light:
 

Mistress Adrienne, I have been given a bed with a pink dresser 
In the hothouse 
Joining the Concord Public Library: the walls and roof are 
Glass and my privacy comes from the apple-geraniums, 
Violets, ferns, marigolds, and white mayflags. 
I get my meals 
With the janitor and his wife and all of the books are mine 
To use. I scour, sweep, and dust. 
I hope you don't think of me 
As a runaway? I remember your kindness, 
Your lessons in reading and writing on the piazza. 
My journey was unusual. I saw some of the war 
And it was terrible even far up into the North. 
My first fright was at a train depot outside Memphis 
Where some soldiers found me eating not yet ripened   
Quinces and grapes, they took me prisoner: first 
I helped some children carry tree limbs to the woodbox 
Of the locomotive, then, I was shown to a gentleman 
In the passenger car who was searching for his runaway 
Negress in a purple dress; he wouldn't identify me, 

And I was thrown in with about forty stray blacks into 
An open boxcar and soon we were moving, next to me 
A man was sucking on the small breasts of a girl 
Maybe twelve years of age, across from them 
A sad old woman smiled as she puffed on an old cigar end, 
By afternoon she was dead, her two friends 
Just kicked her out so that she rolled down into pasture 
Frightening some hogs that ran off into a thicket. 
The girl next to me whimpered and shook. Those quinces 
Just ran straight through me and all I could do was 
Squat in one corner that was supplied with ammonia-waters 
And hay. We were given that night Confederate uniforms 
To mend and when the others slept I dressed in three 
Shirts and trousers and leapt from the moving train, 
The padding helped some but I couldn't walk the next day. 
I hid in a shack that seemed lonely but for a flock 
Of turkeys, some young hens, and a corncrib with tall 
Split palings. The next morning from a hill 
I watched field-workers on a tobacco plantation, it took 
Two men to carry a single leaf like a corpse from 
A battle scene. That night I found a horse with a bit 
In its mouth made of telegraph wire. He carried me up all 
The way to Youngstown. Chloe, you must 
Learn to swim in the pond and to ride the old sorrel. 
I am grateful. I had to swim two rivers. I fished some 
For perch, bream, and trout and ate dried berries.   
I stole a bushel of oysters from the porch of a farmhouse. 
I treated my sores with blackgum from poplars. I witnessed 
The hanging of three Confederate soldiers at a trestle: 
Once they were done dancing, they settled in their greatcoats 
Like dead folded birds. I have a hatred 
Of men and I walked away from the trestle singing. 
I spoke to The Concord Literary Club last Tuesday 
About my experiences. I told them you never did 
Abuse me. How we would sit out in the gazebo 
And listen to the boys with their violins, tambourines, 
Bones, drums and sticks. How we wept as girls 
When the fox bit the head off our peahen and that 
From that day how the peacock, missing his mate, would 
See her in his reflection in a downstairs window 
And fly at it increasing his iridescence with lacerations. 
When I left you the windows were all missing and daubers 
Were making their mud houses in the high corners 
Of the hallway. With sugar-water and crepe I have put a new 
Hem on my purple dress. 

At night I walk down the aisles 
Of the library, the books climb twenty feet above me,   
I just walk there naked with my tiny lamp. 
I have the need to fling the lamp sometimes: but I resist it. 
Mistress Adrienne, I saw three big cities burning! 
Did you know ladies from Philadelphia rode for two days 
In wagons to climb a hill where with spyglasses they watched 
The war like a horse-pulling contest at a fair. 
The man beside me on the train who was sucking the little 
Girl's breasts, he was your stable boy, Napoleon. He said 
He never had a bad word for you. His little mistress was 
Still bare to the waist and before I leapt from the train, 
And while he slept, I ran a rod into his eye. I stabbed him 
In his brain. She stopped weeping. 
Remember that French lullaby where two fleas in a gentleman's 
Mustache die like a kiss between the lips of the gentleman 
And his mistress. How we laughed at it! 
I hope you were not long unconscious there beside the pond. 
I just ran away from you, listening the whole night 
For your father's hounds. I am 
Afraid I split your parasol on your skull. If I 
Don't hear from you I will try to understand. Chloe.

There is a button on the remote control called FAV. You can program your favorite channels. Don't like the world you live in, choose one closer to the world you live in. I choose the independent film channel and HBO. Neither have news programs as far as I can tell. This is what is great about America--anyone can make these kinds of choices. Instead of the news, HBO has The Sopranos. This week the indie channel is playing and replaying Spaghetti Westerns. Always someone gets shot or pierced through the heart with an arrow, and just before he dies he says, I am not going to make it. Where? Not going to make it where? On some level, maybe, the phrase simply means not going to make it into the next day, hour, minute, or perhaps the next second. Occasionally, you can imagine, it means he is not going to make it to Carson City or Texas or somewhere else out west or to Mexico if he is on the run. On another level always implicit is the sense that it means he is not going to make it to his own death. Perhaps in the back of all our minds is the life expectancy for our generation. Perhaps this expectation lingers there alongside the hours of sleep one should get or the number of times one is meant to chew food--eight hours, twenty chews, and seventy-six years. We are all heading there and not to have that birthday is not to have made it.





"A father tells his son the thing he regrets most about...
 

A father tells his son the thing he regrets most about his life is the amount of time he has spent worrying about it. 

   Worry 1. A dog's action of biting and shaking an animal so as to injure or kill it, spec., a hound's worrying of its quarry; an instance of this. 2. A state or feeling of mental unease or anxiety regarding or arising from one's cares or responsibilities, uncertainty about the future, fear of failure, etc.; anxious concern, anxiety. Also, an instance or cause of this. 

   It achieved nothing, all his worrying. Things worked out or they didn't work out and now here he was, an old man, an old man who each year of his life bit or shook doubt as if to injure if not to kill, an old man with a good-looking son who resembles his deceased mother. It is uncanny how she rests there, as plain as day, in their boy's face. 

   Worry 8. Cause mental distress or agitation to (a person, oneself); make anxious and ill at ease. 9. Give way to anxiety, unease, or disquietude: allow one's mind to dwell on difficulties or troubles. 

   He waits for his father's death. His father has been taken off the ventilator and clearly will not be able to breathe for himself much longer. Earlier in the day the nurse mentioned something about an electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures brain waves in the cerebral hemispheres, the parts of the brain that deal with speech and memory. But his brain stem is damaged; it seems now the test will not be necessary. The son expects an almost silent, hollow gasp to come from the old man's open mouth. Those final sounds, however, are nothing like the wind moving through the vacancy of a mind. The release is jerky and convulsive. There is never the rasp or the choke the son expects, though one meaning of worry is to be choked on, to choke on.





The Presence
 

MARIA NEFELE:
   I walk in thorns in the dark   
   of what's to happen and what has
   with my only weapon my only defense
   my nails purple like cyclamens.

ANTIPHONIST:        
   I saw her everywhere. Holding a glass and staring in space. Lying down
   listening to records. Walking the streets in wide trousers and an old
   gabardine. In front of children's-store windows. Sadder then. And in 
   discotheques, more nervous, eating her nails. She smokes innumerable 
   cigarettes. She is pale and beautiful. But if you talk to her she doesn't hear 
   at all. As if something is happening  she alone hears it and is frightened. 
   She holds your hand tight, tears, but is not there. I never touched her and I 
   never took from her anything.

MN:
   He understood nothing. He kept asking all the time "Remember? What's to 
   remember? My dreams alone I remember because I see them at night. Days 
   I feel bad  how to say: unprepared. I found myself so suddenly, in life 
   where I'd hardly expected. I'd say "Bah, I'll get used to it. And everything 
   around me ran. Things and people ran, ran  until I set myself to run like 
   crazy. But, it seems, I overdid. Because  I don't know  something strange 
   happened in the end. First I'd see the corpse and then the murder. First 
   came the blood and then the blow and cry. And now, when I hear rain I don't 
   know what's waiting...

A:
   "Why don't they bury people standing up like archbishops?  that's what 
   she'd say to me. And once, I remember, summer on the island, all of us 
   coming from a party, dawn, we jumped over the bars of the museum's 
   garden. She danced on the stones and she saw nothing.

MN:
   I saw his eyes.  I saw some old olive groves.

A: 
   I saw a column on a grave. A girl in relief on the stone. She seemed sad 
   and held a small bird in her cupped hand.

MN:
   He was looking at me, I know, he was looking at me. We both were looking 
   at the same stone. We looked at each other through the stone.

A:
   She was calm and in her palm she held a small bird.

MN: 
   She was sitting and she was dead.

A: 
   She was sitting and in her palm she held a small bird.
   You'll never hold a bird like that  you aren't able.

MN:
   Oh if they let me, if they let me.

A:
   If who let you?

MN:
   The one who lets nothing.

A:
   He, he who lets nothing
   is cut by his shadow and walks away.

MN: 
   His words are white and unspeakable
   his eyes deep and without sleep...

A:
   But the whole upper part of the stone was taken. And with it her name.

MN:
   ARIMNA  as if I could still see the letters carved inside the light... 
   ARIMNA EFE EL...

A:
   Gone. The whole top gone. There were no letters at all.

MN: 
   ARIMNA EFE EL  there, on the EL the stone had cut and broken. I remember
   it well.

A:
   She must have seen it in a dream since she remembers.

MN:
   In my dreams, yes. In a large sleep that will come sometimes all light and 
   heat and small stony steps. The children will walk in the streets arm in arm    
   like in some old Italian movies. Song everywhere and enormous women in 
   small balconies watering their flowers.

A:
   A large blue balloon will take us high then, here and there, the wind will beat 
   us. The silver domes will stand out first, then the belfries. The streets will 
   appear narrower and straighter than we imagined. The terraces with the 
   white television antennas. And all around the hills, and the kites  so close 
   we'll just shave past them. Until one moment we'll see the whole sea. On it 
   the souls will be leaving small white steams.

MN:
   I have lifted my hand against the mountains, the dark and the demonic of 
   this world. I've asked love "Why? and rolled her on the floor. War and war 
   and not one rag to hide deep in our things and forget. Who listens? Who 
   listened? Judges, priests, police, which is your country? One body is left me 
   and I give it. On it those who know cultivate the holy, as the gardeners in 
   Holland, tulips. And in it drown who never learned of sea or swimming... Flux 
   of the sea and you stars' distant influx  stand by me!

A:
   I have lifted my hand against the
   unexorcised demons of the world
   and from the place of illness I have exited
   to the sun and to the light self-exiled!

MN:
   And from too many storms I've exited
   self among humans exiled!





The Seagull
 

Chekhov, at Yalta
A winter evening at the cottage by the bay, 
And I sat in the black and gold of the dead garden 
Wrapped in blankets, eating my sister's suet pudding. 
The fountain was wrapped in dirty straw and 

Just below my property in the old Tartar cemetery 
There was a small funeral in progress: the widow 
Is wearing a purple shawl, the children are bare around 
The shoulders and the girls are wearing orange petals 

At their throats. The ashen white beards of the men 
Are like immaculate vests from this distance. 
There is nothing more intolerable than suet pudding, 
Unless it is the visitors. The drunken visitors laughing 

In my kitchen, eating my duck and venison, while I hide 
From them here in the dark garden. 
The daughter of one of these gentlemen is pretty. 
I saw her through the window drinking 

Champagne from a clay mug--just under her thin blouse 
I saw the blue points of her breasts that turn, 
In opposition, both out and up like the azure slippers 
Of the priest who is now singing in the cemetery below my house. 

Once the family has gone off with its torches I'll 
Climb down to the fresh grave and drop some coins 
For flowers, even wooden teeth for the widow so she can 

Attract a new husband? The black, turned soil 
Or our garden reminds me 
Of the common grave given to the children 
Of the Godunov Orphanage after that horrible fire: 

A charred horse was thrown in with them, 
Bags of lime, and what I understood to be a large ham 
That the authorities, nevertheless, declared 
The torso of a male child of nine or ten. The Czar, 

In their memory, placed a tiny trout pond over them 
And this inscription: A blue blanket for my little ones. 
My wife goes nearly naked to parties in Moscow. 
My sister here, at Yalta, goes sea bathing with a rope 

Around her that runs back to the beach where it is 
Attached to a donkey who is commanded by a servant 
With a long switch. 
The sea tows her out and then the donkey is whipped 

Sorrowfully until he has dragged her back to them. 
I named the donkey, Moon, after the mystery of his service 
To my sister. This winter 
He has been an excellent friend. 

I read to this poor beast from Three Sisters. He is a better 
Critic and audience than I could find in the cities. 
I have won an Award that will save me from arrest anywhere 
Inside Russia. I am going to refuse it! And then travel 

To Nice or Paris. 
My tuberculosis is worse. Tolstoi reads my stories 
To his family after supper. And reads them badly, I suppose! 
I did walk that evening all the way down to the cemetery 

Only to discover that my pockets were empty. 
I screamed up to the house for coins, for plenty 
Of coins! The visitors, laughing and singing, ran down 
To me without coats and with a lantern swinging-- 

My sister trailed behind them 
On her donkey. Her square black hat 
Bobbing like a steamer way out in the bay. 
And when they reached me-- 

I said, "Sister, pack the trunks! You hurt me! 
I will write that we have departed for France, for Italy.





Elegy to the Sioux
 

The vase was made of clay 
With spines of straw 
For strength. The sunbaked vase 
Soaked in a deep blue dye for days. The events in this wilderness, 
Portrayed in the round of the vase, 

Depend on shades of indigo against 
The masked areas of the clay, a flat pearl color 
To detail the big sky and snow... 

This Montana field in winter is not sorrowful: 
A bugle skips through notes: 

We view it all somehow from the center of the field 
And there are scattered groups of cavalry. Some of these 
Men were seasoned by civil war. Their caps are blue. 
Their canteens are frozen. The horses shake their heads 
Bothered by beads of ice, the needles of ice 
Forming at both sides of their great anvil heads. 

The long, blue cloaks of the officers fall over the haunches 
Of the horses. The ammunition wagons 
Beside the woods are blurred by the snowy weather... 

Beyond the wagons, farther even, into the woods 
There is a sloping streambed. This is 
The dark side of the vase which is often misunderstood. 
From here through the bare trees there's 
A strange sight to be seen at the very middle of the field: 

A valet is holding a bowl of cherries--archetype and rubric, 
A general with white hair eats the fruit while introducing its color 
Which will flow through the woods in early December. 

An Indian woman came under dark clouds to give birth, unattended 
In the deep wash inside the woods. She knew the weather 

Could turn and staked the tips of two rooted spruce trees 
To the earth to make a roof. 
The deerskin of her robe is in her mouth. Her legs spread, 
He feet are tied up in the roof of darkening spruce. No stars 
Show through! But on the vase that belonged to a President 
There are countless stars above the soldiers' campfires... 

With rawhide her feet are tied high in the spruce 
And her right hand is left loose as if she were about 
To ride a wild stallion 
                            to its conclusion in a box canyon. 

President Grant drinks bourbon from his boot. The Sioux 
Cough in their blankets... 

It snowed an hour more, and then the moon appeared. The 
                  unborn infant, 
Almost out on the forest floor, buckled and lodged. It died. 
Its mother died. Just before she closed her eyes 
She rubbed snow up and down inside of her bare thighs. 

In the near field an idle, stylish horse raised one leg 
To make a perfect right angle. Just then a ghost of snow formed 
Over the tents of the soldiers, 

It blows past the stylish, gray horse, 
Unstopped it moves through woods, up the streambed, 
And passes into the crude spruce shelter, into the raw open 
Woman, her legs raised into sky-- 
Naked house of snow and ice! This gust of wind 

Spent the night within the woman. At sunrise, it left her mouth 
Tearing out trees, keeping the owls from sleep; it was angry now 
And into the field it spilled, into the bivouac of pony soldiers 
Who turned to the south, who turned back to the woods, who became 

Still. Blue all over! If there is snow still unspooling in the mountains 
Then there is time yet for the President to get his Indian vase 
And to fill it with bourbon from his boot and to put flowers into it: 
The flowers die in a window that looks out on a cherry tree 
Which heavy with fruit drops a branch: 
                                                            
                                                       torn to its very heartwood 
By the red clusters of fruit, the branch fell 
Like her leg and foot 
Out of the sky into Montana...





Thomas Hardy
 

The first morning after anyone's death, is it important 
To know that fields are wet, that the governess is 
Naked but with a scarf still covering her head, that 
She's sitting on a gardener who's wearing 
Just a blue shirt, or that he's sitting on a chair in the kitchen. 
They look like they are rowing while instead outside in the mist 
Two boats are passing on the river, the gardener's mouth 
Is opening: 

A white, screaming bird lifts off the river into the trees, 
Flies a short distance and is joined 
By a second bird, but then as if to destroy everything 
The two white birds are met by a third. The night 
Always fails. The cows are now standing in the barns. 
You can hear the milk as it drills into wooden pails.

The Farm
 

My father's farm is an apple blossomer. 
He keeps his hills in dandelion carpet 
and weaves a lane of lilacs between the rose 
and the jack-in-the-pulpits. 
His sleek cows ripple in the pastures. 
The dog and purple iris 
keep watch at the garden's end. 

His farm is rolling thunder, 
a lightning bolt on the horizon. 
His crops suck rain from the sky 
and swallow the smoldering sun. 
His fields are oceans of heat, 
where waves of gold 
beat the burning shore. 

A red fox 
pauses under the birch trees, 
a shadow is in the river's bend. 
When the hawk circles the land, 
my father's grainfields whirl beneath it. 
Owls gather together to sing in his woods, 
and the deer run his golden meadow. 

My father's farm is an icicle, 
a hillside of white powder. 
He parts the snowy sea, 
and smooths away the valleys. 
He cultivates his rows of starlight 
and drags the crescent moon 
through dark unfurrowed fields.





Evening Angelus
 

I have forgotten the words, 
and therefore I shall not conceive 
of a mysterious salvation, I shall 
not become a tall lily and bloom 
into blue and white. Then what 
oracular event shall appear on 
my doorstep? What announcement 
shall crowd me to a corner, 
protesting an unworthiness, 
which doubtless shall be believed? 

But these are only bells we hear, 
pulled down by the arms of the 
drunken janitor, two fingers missing 
on his left hand. And we have 
climbed into that tower, its spiraling 
wooden staircase creaking beneath our 
feet. We have seen for ourselves 
that it is only iron that rings, iron 
swinging on an iron bar, the rough rope 
threading down to the cold ground, 
no death or holiness in 
those hollow shells.





In Black
 

The image that haunts me is not beautiful. 
I do not think it will open into a field 
of wildflowers; I doubt that it will take 
wing suddenly, startling us into admiration. 

It is one of those brutish facts of life, 
the awkward nakedness of the memory when 
it takes off its clothes and crawls 
between the top and bottom sheet. Or rather, 

It is my mother's memory that I carry, 
pressed into my own: how at her grandfather's 
funeral, his daughter--my mother's mother-- 
stood at an open door and cried, and then 

The blood ran down her legs, gushing from 
the womb where thirteen children had nestled, 
and now, at once horrified and at ease with her 
body's impropriety, they gathered all around. 

This was the grandmother who lost three of those 
thirteen, who hung a million baskets of wash, 
who peeled a million potatoes, and splattered 
her arms with the grease of constant cooking. 

This was my grandmother who kept chickens, 
who left her voice in the throats of all my aunts, 
and was struck down in the cellar, legs twisted 
beneath the fall and half her face stiffened. 

Helpless until they found her, the jar 
of canned fruit smashed on the cement. 
And then at her funeral, I saw my mother's 
tears, gliding ahead of me in a black limousine, 
a procession not beautiful but haunting.





Living in the Body
 

Body is something you need in order to stay 
on this planet and you only get one. 
And no matter which one you get, it will not 
be satisfactory. It will not be beautiful 
enough, it will not be fast enough, it will 
not keep on for days at a time, but will 
pull you down into a sleepy swamp and 
demand apples and coffee and chocolate cake. 

Body is a thing you have to carry 
from one day into the next. Always the 
same eyebrows over the same eyes in the same 
skin when you look in the mirror, and the 
same creaky knee when you get up from the 
floor and the same wrist under the watchband. 
The changes you can make are small and 
costly--better to leave it as it is. 

Body is a thing that you have to leave 
eventually. You know that because you have 
seen others do it, others who were once like you, 
living inside their pile of bones and 
flesh, smiling at you, loving you, 
leaning in the doorway, talking to you 
for hours and then one day they 
are gone. No forwarding address.





Little Black Tangrams
 

1 

No one felt in the dark for his hat. 
No one budged an inch. 
Thus the story draws to its end. 
No one felt over the edge 
of her silk pocket to touch her parking ticket. 
No one even wished to 
walk out of the dark to the street. 


2 

Over the transparent page I traced my name. 
I thought about The Bird That Turns Around, 
How To Blow A Brick Over, What To Do 
While Waiting For The Doctor, Answers To 
Problems On Page 2,000, The Chair That 
Comes To You, The Mysterious Paper Purse, 
The Universe Around Us, Lift To Erase. 


3 

Those days everything I thought trembled 
through the rotating blades of an electric fan. 
The way my voice moved through it. 
The way my fingers shook. 
I wore a two-tiered hat. 
A dead mule is huge. 
The man with the stick was fat. 


4 

A dead deer has the face of a rat. 
Last night I watched seven white deer 
walk single file across the black edge, 
the levee's border. 
Slowly, each one looked me over, 
saw I was sleeping, and soon came closer 
to lick my face all over. 


5 

All fall I played at being a slave. 
In the red embers of fires I made 
I burned slips of paper with politicians' names 
to pass the time. 
I cooked rich soups of dragonflies. 
I learned to aim an arrow 
through a devilhorse's brain. 


6 

I sat alone by the water. 
They trusted me with the river. 
When United Fruit Company boats 
headed for port, upriver, 
I called out to sailors, 
down came stalks of bananas 
to snag and bring up to the batture.

When the polls opened until the polls closed 
two men dangled their rifles over their shoulders 
and pretended they couldn't be seen. 
The men and women who came were embarrassed. 
They looked down at the white glare 
of crushed shells at their feet. 
They looked off into the distance. 


8 

In the hot sun on the wooden platform 
I stood waiting for the icehouse doors to open. 
I wanted to be asked inside 
the cool bricks of smoking water, frozen 
and squared in fifty-pound blocks, 
rattling along belts of silver rollers. 
I wanted to be cool and dry. 


9 

The women were left locked in the house. 
The rifle's blue-black barrel shone 
in the corner against the white, white wall. 
Somewhere in the swamps around us 
a man threw himself against the dark. 
I couldn't understand why our lights were on. 
I wondered if he would drown. 


10 

I was afraid of the iridescent algae pool, 
hit with glaze after an afternoon storm, 
lifted like a giant keyhole, 
lit by the great green eyeball behind it, 
watching me, watching me turn away, 
watching me look back, watching me, for all I knew, 
catch my breath, not wanting to give it back. 


11 

We walked into the parking lot 
after 10 o'clock mass on Sunday. 
A car's blur crossed our path 
so close I felt the heat of the sun 
in the hot wind off its fender. 
They only meant to scare us. 
I felt then what my prayers might have been. 


12 

That afternoon someone decided to slaughter the   
                                                                   rabbits. 
They held the scruffs of their necks, 
whacked their soft brown crowns 
with cracked baseball bats. 
Each one bled through the nose. 
We fed their guts to the alligator 
by the shed in the deep, deep hole. 


13 

I watched them kissing, kissing in sorrow, 
in the sitting rooms in the funeral parlor. 
They were drinking cafe au lait 
and eating ham sandwiches. 
Yes, there were so many flowers. 
I didn't want to be kissed in sorrow. 
I didn't want to be patted or pitied. 


14 

The squeak and thump and mist of flit 
as someone pumped sprays of insecticide. 
It fell over my face, like a blessing, 
like a tingling sensation in my fingers, 
like a thousand evaporating lessons, 
it fell on the oil lamp's wick. 
The flame danced. It wobbled, dipped and brightened.





Plaisir
 

Diarrhea: what nobody likes, 
though a word the French love to pronounce. 
They surround it with lips and tongue; 
it pleases, like saying cellar door does. 
Once I gave a pair of tweezers 
to an au pair girl who couldn't extract 
a splinter from her foot. It was a pleasure 
for both of us to see that little thing come out.





The Batture
 

The batture's water and sand disappear 
when water swells the river, 
heat's portion of a northern winter. 
Under willows cropped up 
since our last cow is dead 
and carried to the batture 
to be taken by the water 
clean into another season, 
we sit on green granite 
piled deep enough to keep 
the batture dry one more week. 

We don't say so but we wait 
for the swollen body 
to appear before us, we want 
the torn leg to distract us, 
the loose arm to show us where. 
We've always known which way 
the water runs, the differences 
among earth, air, water 
and whatever the horizon offers 
that is not actually there. 
We want to be the ones 
to identify the missing person. 
We count the reward we'd earn. 

There is a family 
in southern Minnesota 
keeping a closet of dry-cleaned 
suits, a mahogany high-boy 
of ironed shirts, folded 
undershorts and sweaters. 
In the ashtray that says Welcome to Nevada 
are the coins he left 
without thinking, 
the only clue which tells his family 
what they didn't want to know, 
he might have known 
what he was doing. 

We want to be the ones whose call 
is first in a series of related events 
which will end we hope in the family's 
satisfaction with the coroner's 
identification, and though it is old-fashioned 
and no longer done in this country, 
we'd like to think the pennies 
from his pocket will be mailed 
to the morgue, polished to 
their copper finish, pressed 
to float forever on his eyelids and make us 
take a second look as the light 
hits them and they beautifully glitter. 

We think how glad we were 
when we first saw him he floated 
face down in the water 
which a few moments earlier had been snow 
his children sledded and slipped on. 
Light beats gravity, lifts 
these young trees from the water. 
This is where we watch time, 
mark the spot across the water 
which is the red flag 
we hope calls us 
come across and save us. 
This is twenty-eight states.





A Secret Matter of Grave Importance
 

Except when once we drew identical lots 
nothing's ever come between us. 
We keep our drifts of space 
spare and daily shake our down. 

You've glanced beyond your dirty cuffs 
and caught me hand-washing my clean shirts. 
Stuck with sharp wind, both 
bloods are rare and rarely do 

we taste the walnut's knot of oil. 
We wake between our fitted sheets 
and shake our fists or pretend real fright 
but not in this do we dare touch. 

My rib cage can stand in yours, yours 
become the swinging doors through which 
magician's swords will slice and miss 
that knotted muscle. It is a trick. 

We'll make an endless show of the outright 
clanking, irregular beating of our acrobatic hearts. 
We've designed the double bars of depth; 
our hearts skip -- the tumbleset we think 

is absence, the somersault we call forbearance 
-- the hearts are there, doing turns that teach 
us to count and keep each finger 
close to its own sly pulse.





Tiger Butter
 

Is it only when you're little 
you know tigers live in your closet-- 
one with your shoes on his two ears, 
another with your umbrella tied to his tail; 
the rest wearing your red coat 
and blue trousers with the red buttons? 
Is it only when you're little 
the dustballs have mountainous shadows 
in the crack of light under the door? 
Or is it also NOW you fear that tigers will eat you-- 
when you wake in the middle of the night 
and don't know where you are, 
nor remember how far you've come. 
Your nose hurts like a plowed field, 
your fingers stiff-- 
Then somehow, you remember what you've accomplished. 
The sewing is finished-- 
The red buttons threaded to the blue pants 
and the little coat with its sleeves. 
And you know you have given them to the tigers 
(so they won't eat you). 
But they chased themselves around a tree 
and melted into butter. 
NOW you can pick up your coat and trousers, 
your shoes and umbrella. 
Soon, even, you can start your car and go-- 
The promise of dawn already 
on the face 
of the clock-radio.





Old Prairie House Between Tulsa and Bartlesville on US 75
 

I 

Back in time 
car in yard 
shutters at windows 
paint on gray boards 
old man, old woman 
their children gone 
then man and woman younger 
       with young children 
west wing not yet built on house 
one wagon, horse arrive 
untended land 
back too far 
young man, woman with eyes 
       like bright baubles 
holding space 
one shutter closes on another. 


II 

Grizzled, unpossessed 
on the ledge of plains 
factional roof 
meager walls written upon 
like points of long prairie grass 
the house stares across the highway 
as though remembering a fir tree 
       carried on horseback 
through blinding snow. 


III 

Survival of facade 
when content does not endure 
one part has nothing to do with the others 
all is hollow 
ramshackled 
but house still stands on prairie 
customs still leap on points 
       of delicate prairie grass 
where the bright bauble of the eye 
blinked once too often.





Perseus in Arkansas
 

Well, jipes! I floored the Chevy/ 
fishtailed all over the soft-tarred 
road 

Old women babbling by the church 
shit no one with balls 
goes to flea markets 

the road festered at Pelsor 
curves at sixty-two 

overturned once on these roads 
still don't know how I got out.





Osage County Museum, Pawhuska, Oklahoma
 

It's mostly the same here 
slow as melonvines in an arctic sun 
where the great ball of the plane 
went down in nineteen thirty-five & an eskimo 
with a camera took a picture that stayed 
in his camera twenty-one years 
& by some chance he told 
an explorer who bought the film 
& found the crash 
& the bodies under tarp looking like 
two seals on the ice, 
the crumpled plane with oversized pontoons, 
the propeller as though 
it could turn again-- 
the men, Wiley Post & Will Rogers, 
still twelve miles southwest of Barrow, Alaska.





Right Justly
 

When he movd into the house 
he wanted us to stomp & pray 
out the evil spirits 
       just in case they'd be there. 

How cld they 
when a medicine woman lived on the place 
& left it to the church when she went to happier 
grounds? 

But a truck hauling brush 
turnd on the road 
       & he jumped up screaming-- 
deer prowler 
       at the antlered beast. 

We danced out the spirits 
he carried on the place. 
                How now pow wow 
he jumps in the sow-yard with the bow- 
                              wow cow. 

We passed the spirits to chickens 
to peck their legs-- 
Eeeeevil spirits pock-marked 
       as the dartboard. 

W/ marbles shooting rabbit eyes 
we stompd wild fires he once built in his head, 
                still haunted him 
as though evil spirits could open 
a medicine woman's door, 
       climb in her unpainted windows, 
crawl through yellowed wallpaper armoured w/ 
                              prayer-chants. 

We whooped & hawed until he sd nuf. 
       The house 
barricaded from deer prowlers 
                from under his headband.





The Last Day
 

The day was cloudy. No one could come to a decision; 
a light wind was blowing. Not a north-easter, the sirocco,' someone said. 
A few slender cypresses nailed to the slope, and, beyond, the sea 
grey with shining pools. 
The soldiers presented arms as it began to drizzle. 
Not a north-easter, the sirocco,' was the only decision heard. 
And yet we knew that by the following dawn 
nothing would be left to us, neither the woman drinking sleep at our side 
nor the memory that we were once men, 
nothing at all by the following dawn. 

This wind reminds me of spring,' said my friend 
as she walked beside me gazing into the distance, the spring 
that came suddenly in the winter by the closed-in sea. 
So unexpected. So many years have gone. How are we going to die?' 

A funeral march meandered through the thin rain. 

How does a man die? Strange no one's thought about it. 
And for those who thought about it, it was like a recollection from old chronicles 
from the time of the Crusades or the battle of Salamis. 
Yet death is something that happens: how does a man die? 
Yet each of us earns his death, his own death, which belongs to no one else 
and this game is life. 

The light was fading from the clouded day, no one decided anything. 
The following dawn nothing would be left to us, everything surrendered, even our hands, 
and our women slaves at the springheads and our children in the quarries. 
My friend, walking beside me, was singing a disjointed song: 
In spring, in summer, slaves . . .' 
One recalled old teachers who'd left us orphans. 
A couple passed, talking: 
I'm sick of the dusk, let's go home, 
let's go home and turn on the light.'

Spring A. D.
 

Again with spring 
she wore light colours 
and with gentle steps 
again with spring 
again in summer 
she was smiling. 

Among fresh blossoms 
breast naked to the veins 
beyond the dry night 
beyond the white old men 
debating quietly 
whether it would be better 
to give up the keys 
or to pull the rope 
and hang from the noose 
to leave empty bodies 
there where souls couldn't endure 
there where the mind couldn't catch up 
and knees buckled. 

With the new blossoms 
the old men failed 
and gave up on everything 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren 
the broad fields 
the green mountains 
love and life 
compassion and shelter 
rivers and sea; 
and they departed like statues 
leaving behind a silence 
that no sword could cut 
that no gallop could break 
nor the voices of the young; 
and the great loneliness came 
the great privation 
along with this spring 
and settled and spread 
like the frost of dawn 
caught hold of the high branches 
slid down the trunks of trees 
and wrapped around our soul. 

But she smiled 
wearing light colours 
like a blossoming almond tree 
in yellow flames 
and walked along lightly 
opening windows 
in the delighted sky 
without us the luckless ones. 
And I saw her breast naked 
the waist and the knee, 
as the inviolate martyr 
inviolate and pure 
issues from the torment 
to go to heaven, 
beyond the inexplicable 
whispering of people 
in the boundless circus 
beyond the black grimace 
the sweaty neck 
of the exasperated executioner 
striking vainly. 

The loneliness now a lake 
the privation now a lake 
untouched and untraceable.

The King of Asini
 

' . . . -- Iliad
All morning long we looked around the citadel 
starting from the shaded side there where the sea 
green and without lustre -- breast of a slain peacock -- 
received us like time without an opening in it. 
Veins of rock dropped down from high above, 
twisted vines, naked, many-branched, coming alive 
at the water's touch, while the eye following them 
struggled to escape the monotonous see-saw motion, 
growing weaker and weaker. 

On the sunny side a long empty beach 
and the light striking diamonds on the huge walls. 
No living thing, the wild doves gone 
and the king of Asini, whom we've been trying to find for two years now, 
unknown, forgotten by all, even by Homer, 
only one word in the Iliad and that uncertain, 
thrown here like the gold burial mask. 
You touched it, remember its sound? Hollow in the light 
like a dry jar in dug earth: 
the same sound that our oars make in the sea. 
The king of Asini a void under the mask 
everywhere with us everywhere with us, under a name: 
' . . .' . . .' 
                                          and his children statues 
and his desires the fluttering of birds, and the wind 
in the gaps between his thoughts, and his ships 
anchored in a vanished port: 
under the mask a void. 

Behind the large eyes the curved lips the curls 
carved in relief on the gold cover of our existence 
a dark spot that you see travelling like a fish 
in the dawn calm of the sea: 
a void everywhere with us. 
And the bird, a wing broken, 
that flew away last winter 
-- tabernacle of life -- 
and the young woman who left to play 
with the dog-teeth of summer 
and the soul that sought the lower world gibbering 
and the country like a large plane-leaf swept along by the torrent of the sun 
with the ancient monuments and the contemporary sorrow. 

And the poet lingers, looking at the stones, and asks himself 
does there really exist 
among these ruined lines, edges, points, hollows and curves 
does there really exist 
here where one meets the path of rain, wind and ruin 
does there exist the movement of the face, shape of the tenderness 
of those who've waned so strangely in our lives, 
those who remained the shadow of waves and thoughts with the sea's boundlessness 
or perhaps no, nothing is left but the weight 
the nostalgia for the weight of a living existence 
there where we now remain unsubstantial, bending 
like the branches of a terrible willow tree heaped in unremitting despair 
while the yellow current slowly carries down rushes uprooted in the mud 
image of a form that the sentence to everlasting bitterness has turned to stone: 
the poet a void. 

Shieldbearer, the sun climbed warring, 
and from the depths of the cave a startled bat 
hit the light as an arrow hits a shield: 
' . . .' . . .'. If only that could be the king of Asini 
we've been searching for so carefully on this acropolis 
sometimes touching with our fingers his touch upon the stones. 


                                                      Asini, summer '38--Athens, Jan. '40





An Old Man on the River Bank
 

To Nani Panayotopoulo
And yet we should consider how we go forward. 
To feel is not enough, nor to think, nor to move 
nor to put your body in danger in front of an old loophole 
when scalding oil and molten lead furrow the walls. 

And yet we should consider towards what we go forward, 
not as our pain would have it, and our hungry children 
and the chasm between us and the companions calling from the opposite shore; 
nor as the bluish light whispers it in an improvised hospital, 
the pharmaceutic glimmer on the pillow of the youth operated on at noon; 
but it should be in some other way, I would say like 
the long river that emerges from the great lakes enclosed deep in Africa, 
that was once a god and then became a road and a benefactor, a judge and a delta; 
that is never the same, as the ancient wise men taught, 
and yet always remains the same body, the same bed, and the same Sign, 
the same orientation. 

I want nothing more than to speak simply, to be granted that grace. 
Because we've loaded even our song with so much music that it's slowly sinking 
and we've decorated our art so much that its features have been eaten away by gold 
and it's time to say our few words because tomorrow our soul sets sail. 

If pain is human we are not human beings merely to suffer pain; 
that's why I think so much these days about the great river, 
this meaning that moves forward among herbs and greenery 
and beasts that graze and drink, men who sow and harvest, 
great tombs even and small habitations of the dead. 
This current that goes its way and that is not so different from the blood of men, 
from the eyes of men when they look straight ahead without fear in their hearts, 
without the daily tremor for trivialities or even for important things; 
when they look straight ahead like the traveller who is used to gauging his way by the stars, 
not like us, the other day, gazing at the enclosed garden of a sleepy Arab house, 
behind the lattices the cool garden changing shape, growing larger and smaller, 
we too changing, as we gazed, the shape of our desire and our hearts, 
at noon's precipitation, we the patient dough of a world that throws us out and kneads us, 
caught in the embroidered nets of a life that was as it should be and then became dust and sank into the sands 
leaving behind it only that vague dizzying sway of a tall palm tree. 


                                                          Cairo, 20 June '42





Thrush
 

I 

                                                       The house near the sea 

The houses I had they took away from me. The times 
happened to be unpropitious: war, destruction, exile; 
sometimes the hunter hits the migratory birds, 
sometimes he doesn't hit them. Hunting 
was good in my time, many felt the pellet; 
the rest circle aimlessly or go mad in the shelters. 

Don't talk to me about the nightingale or the lark 
or the little wagtail 
inscribing figures with his tail in the light; 
I don't know much about houses 
I know they have their own nature, nothing else. 
New at first, like babies 
who play in gardens with the tassels of the sun, 
they embroider coloured shutters and shining doors 
over the day. 
When the architect's finished, they change, 
they frown or smile or even grow resentful 
with those who stayed behind, with those who went away 
with others who'd come back if they could 
or others who disappeared, now that the world's become 
an endless hotel. 

I don't know much about houses, 
I remember their joy and their sorrow 
sometimes, when I stop to think; 
                                                       again 
sometimes, near the sea, in naked rooms 
with a single iron bed and nothing of my own, 
watching the evening spider, I imagine 
that someone is getting ready to come, that they dress him up 
in white and black robes, with many-coloured jewels, 
and around him venerable ladies, 
grey hair and dark lace shawls, talk softly, 
that he is getting ready to come and say goodbye to me; 
or that a woman -- eyelashes quivering, slim-waisted, 
returning from southern ports, 
Smyrna Rhodes Syracuse Alexandria, 
from cities closed like hot shutters, 
with perfume of golden fruit and herbs -- 
climbs the stairs without seeing 
those who've fallen asleep under the stairs. 

Houses, you know, grow resentful easily when you strip them bare. 



          II 

                                                                Sensual Elpenor 

I saw him yesterday standing by the door 
below my window; it was about 
seven o'clock; there was a woman with him. 
He had the look of Elpenor just before he fell 
and smashed himself, yet he wasn't drunk. 
He was speaking fast, and she 
was gazing absently towards the gramophones; 
now and then she cut him short to say a word 
and then would glance impatiently 
towards where they were frying fish: like a cat. 
He muttered with a dead cigarette-butt between his lips: 

-- Listen. There's this too. In the moonlight 
the statues sometimes bend like reeds 
in the midst of ripe fruit -- the statues; 
and the flame becomes a cool oleander, 
the flame that burns one, I mean.' 

-- It's just the light. . . shadows of the night.' 

-- Maybe the night that split open, a blue pomegranate, 
a dark breast, and filled you with stars, 
cleaving time. 
                     And yet the statues 
bend sometimes, dividing desire in two, 
like a peach; and the flame 
becomes a kiss on the limbs, then a sob, 
then a cool leaf carried off by the wind; 
they bend; they become light with a human weight. 
You don't forget it.' 

                              -- The statues are in the museum.' 

-- No, they pursue you, why can't you see it? 
I mean with their broken limbs, 
with their shape from another time, a shape you don't recognize   
yet know. 
                        It's as though 
in the last days of your youth you loved 
a woman who was still beautiful, and you were always afraid, 
as you held her naked at noon, 
of the memory aroused by your embrace; 
were afraid the kiss might betray you 
to other beds now of the past 
which nevertheless could haunt you 
so easily, so easily, and bring to life 
images in the mirror, bodies once alive: 
their sensuality. 
                              It's as though 
returning home from some foreign country you happen to open 
an old trunk that's been locked up a long time 
and find the tatters of clothes you used to wear 
on happy occasions, at festivals with many-coloured lights, 
mirrored, now becoming dim, 
and all that remains is the perfume of the absence 
of a young form. 
                               Really, those statues are not 
the fragments. You yourself are the relic; 
they haunt you with a strange virginity 
at home, at the office, at receptions for the celebrated, 
in the unconfessed terror of sleep; 
they speak of things you wish didn't exist 
or would happen years after your death, 
and that's difficult because. . .' 

                                       -- The statues are in the museum. 
Good night.' 

      -- . . . because the statues are no longer 
fragments. We are. The statues bend lightly. . . Good night.' 

At this point they separated. He took 
the road leading uphill toward the North 
and she moved on towards the light-flooded beach 
where the waves are drowned in the noise from the radio: 

                                                                   The radio 

-- Sails puffed out by the wind 
are all that stay in the mind. 
Perfume of silence and pine 
will soon be an anodyne 
now that the sailor's set sail, 
flycatcher, catfish and wagtail. 
O woman whose touch is dumb, 
hear the wind's requiem. 

Drained is the golden keg 
the sun's become a rag 
round a middle-aged woman's neck 
who coughs and coughs without break; 
for the summer that's gone she sighs, 
for the gold on her shoulders, her thighs. 
O woman, O sightless thing, 
Hear the blind man sing. 

Close the shutters: the day recedes; 
make flutes from yesteryear's reeds 
and don't open, knock how they may: 
they shout but have nothing to say. 
Take cyclamen, pine-needles, the lily, 
anemones out of the sea; 
O woman whose wits are lost, 
listen, the water's ghost. . . 

-- Athens. The public has heard 
the news with alarm; it is feared 
a crisis is near. The prime 
minister declared: "There is no more time. . . 
Take cyclamen. . . needles of pine. . . 
the lily. . . needles of pine. . . 
O woman. . . 
-- . . . is overwhelmingly stronger. 
The war. . .'

This wood that cooled my forehead 
at times when noon burned my veins 
will flower in other hands. Take it. I'm giving it to you; 
look, it's wood from a lemon tree. . .' 
                                                                  I heard the voice 
as I was gazing at the sea trying to make out 
a ship they'd sunk there years ago; 
it was called Thrush', a small wreck; the masts, 
broken, swayed at odd angles deep underwater, like tentacles, 
or the memory of dreams, marking the hull: 
vague mouth of some huge dead sea-monster 
extinguished in the water. Calm spread all around. 

And gradually, in turn, other voices followed, 
whispers thin and thirsty 
emerging from the other side of the sun, the dark side; 
you might say they were asking to drink a drop of blood; 
familiar voices, but I couldn't distinguish one from the other. 
And then the voice of the old man reached me; I felt it 
falling into the heart of day, 
quietly, as though motionless: 
And if you condemn me to drink poison, I thank you. 
Your law will be my law; how can I go 
wandering from one foreign country to another, a rolling stone. 
I prefer death. 
Whose path is for the better only God knows.' 

Countries of the sun yet you cannot face the sun. 
Countries of men yet you cannot face man.   

                                                                     The light 

As the years go by 
the judges who condemn you grow in number; 
as the years go by and you converse with fewer voices, 
you see the sun with different eyes: 
you know that those who stayed behind were deceiving you 
the delirium of flesh, the lovely dance 
that ends in nakedness. 
It's as though, turning at night into an empty highway, 
you suddenly see the eyes of an animal shine, 
eyes already gone; so you feel your own eyes: 
you gaze at the sun, then you're lost in darkness. 
The Doric chiton 
that swayed like the mountains when your fingers touched it 
is a marble figure in the light, but its head is in darkness. 
And those who abandoned the stadium to take up arms 
struck the obstinate marathon runner 
and he saw the track sail in blood, 
the world empty like the moon, 
the gardens of victory wither: 
you see them in the sun, behind the sun. 
And the boys who dived from the bowsprits 
go like spindles twisting still, 
naked bodies plunging into black light 
with a coin between the teeth, swimming still, 
while the sun with golden needles sews 
sails and wet wood and colours of the sea; 
even now they're going down obliquely 
toward the pebbles on the sea floor, 
white oil-flasks. 

Light, angelic and black, 
laughter of waves on the sea's highways 
tear-stained laughter, 
the old suppliant sees you 
as he moves to cross the invisible fields -- 
light mirrored in his blood, 
the blood that gave birth to Eteocles and Polynices. 
Day, angelic and black; 
the brackish taste of woman that poisons the prisoner 
emerges from the wave a cool branch adorned with drops. 
Sing little Antigone, sing, O sing. . . 
I'm not speaking to you about things past, I'm speaking about love; 
adorn your hair with the sun's thorns, 
dark girl; 
the heart of the Scorpion has set, 
the tyrant in man has fled, 
and all the daughters of the sea, Nereids, Graeae, 
hurry toward the shimmering of the rising goddess: 
whoever has never loved will love, 
in the light; 
                      and you find yourself 
in a large house with many windows open 
running from room to room, not knowing from where to look out first, 
because the pine trees will vanish, and the mirrored mountains, and the chirping of birds 
the sea will empty, shattered glass, from north and south 
your eyes will empty of the light of day 
the way the cicadas all together suddenly fall silent. 


                                          Poros, Galini', 31 October 1946





The Composers Winter Dream
 

for my father
Vivid and heavy, he strolls through dark brick kitchens 
Within the great house of Esterhazy: 
A deaf servant's candle 
Is tipped toward bakers who are quarreling about 
The green kindling! The wassail is 
Being made by pouring beer and sherry from dusty bottles 

Over thirty baked apples in a large bowl: into 
The wassail, young girls empty their aprons of 
Cinnamon, ground mace, and allspice berries. A cook adds 
Egg whites and brandy. The giant glass snifters 
On a silver tray are taken from the kitchen by two maids. 
The anxious pianist eats the edges of a fig 

Stuffed with Devonshire cream. In the sinks the gallbladders 
Of geese are soaking in cold salted water. 
Walking in the storm, this evening, he passed 
Children in rags, singing carols; they were roped together 
In the drifting snow outside the palace gate. 
He knew he would remember those boys' faces. . . 

There's a procession into the kitchens: larger boys, each 
With a heavy shoe of coal. The pianist sits and looks 
Hard at a long black sausage. He will not eat 

Before playing the new sonata. Beside him 
The table sags with hams, kidney pies, and two shoulders 
Of lamb. A hand rings a bell in the parlor! 

No longer able to hide, he walks 
Straight into the large room that blinds him with light. 
He sits before the piano still thinking of hulled berries. . . 
The simple sonata which 

He is playing has little 
To do with what he's feeling: something larger 
Where a viola builds, in air, an infinite staircase. 
An oboe joins the viola, they struggle 
For a more florid harmony.   
But the silent violins now emerge 

And, like the big wing of a bird, smother everything 
In a darkness from which only a single horn escapes-- 
That feels effaced by the composer's dream. . . 
But he is not dreaming, 
The composer is finishing two performances simultaneously! 

He is back in the dark kitchens, sulking and counting 
His few florins--they have paid him 
With a snuffbox that was pressed 
With two diamonds, in Holland! 
This century discovers quinine. 
And the sketchbooks of a mad, sad musician 

Who threw a lantern at his landlord who was standing beside 
A critic. He screamed: Here, take the snuffbox, I've filled 
It with the dander of dragons! He apologizes 
The next morning, instructing the landlord to take 
This stuff (Da Ist Der Wisch) to a publisher, 
And sell it! You'll have your velvet garters, Pig! 

The composer is deaf, loud, and feverish. . . he went 
To the countryside in a wet sedan chair. 
He said to himself: for the piper, seventy ducats! He'd curse 
While running his fingers through his tousled hair, he made 
The poor viola climb the stairs. 
He desired loquats, loquats with small pears!   

Ludwig, there are Spring bears under the pepper trees! 
The picnic by the stone house. . . the minnows 
Could have been sunlight striking fissures 
In the stream; Ludwig, where your feet are 
In the cold stream 
Everything is horizontal like the land and living. 

The stream saying, "In the beginning was the word 
And without the word 
Was not anything made that was made. . . 
But let us believe in the word, Ludwig, 
For it is like the sea grasses 
Off which with giant snails eat, at twilight! But then 

The dream turns to autumn; the tinctures he 
Swallows are doing nothing for him, and he shows 
The physicians his spoon which has dissolved 
In the mixtures the chemist has given him! 
After the sonata was heard: the standing for applause 
Over, he walked out where it was snowing. 

It had been dark early that evening. It's here that the 
Dream becomes shocking: he sees a doctor 
In white sleeves 
Who is sawing at the temporal bones of his ears. There is 
A bag of dampened plaster for the death mask. And 
Though he is dead, a pool of urine runs to the 

Middle of the sickroom. A brass urinal is on the floor, it is 
The shape of his ears rusting on gauze. The doctors 

Drink stale wassail. They frown over the dead Beethoven. Outside, 
The same March storm that swept through Vienna an hour before 
Has turned in its tracks like the black, caged panther 
On exhibit in the Esterhazys' candlelit ballroom. The storm crosses 
Over Vienna once more: lightning strikes the Opera House, its eaves 
And awnings filled with hailstones, 

Flames leaping to the adjacent stables! Someone had known, 
As thunder dropped flower boxes off windowsills, 
Someone must have known 
That, at this moment, the violins would emerge 
In a struggle with the loud, combatant horns.





In the Goddesss Name I Summon You. . .
 

Oil on limbs, 
maybe a rancid smell 
as on the chapel's 
oil-press here, 
as on the rough pores 
of the unturning stone. 

Oil on hair 
wreathed in rope 
and maybe other scents 
unknown to us 
poor and rich 
and statuettes offering 
small breasts with their fingers. 

Oil in the sun 
the leaves shuddered 
when the stranger stopped 
and the silence weighed 
between the knees. 
The coins fell: 
In the goddess's name I summon you...' 

Oil on the shoulders 
and the flexing waist 
legs grass-dappled, 
and that wound in the sun 
as the bell rang for vespers 
as I spoke in the churchyard 
with a crippled man.





Helen
 

Teucer: . . . in sea-girt Cyprus, where it was decreed  by Apollow that I should live, giving the city  the name of Salamis in memory of my island home.  .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  Helen: I never went to Troy; it was a phantom.  .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  Servant: What? You mean it was only for a cloud  that we struggled so much?   -- Euripides, Helen  
The nightingales won't let you sleep in Platres.' 

Shy nightingale, in the breathing of the leaves, 
you who bestow the forest's musical coolness 
on the sundered bodies, on the souls 
of those who know they will not return. 
Blind voice, you who grope in the darkness of memory 
for footsteps and gestures -- I wouldn't dare say kisses -- 
and the bitter raving of the frenzied slave-woman. 

The nightingales won't let you sleep in Platres.' 

Platres: where is Platres? And this island: who knows it? 
I've lived my life hearing names I've never heard before: 
new countries, new idiocies of men 
or of the gods; 
                      my fate, which wavers 
between the last sword of some Ajax 
and another Salamis, 
brought me here, to this shore. 
                                              The moon 
rose from the sea like Aphrodite, 
covered the Archer's stars, now moves to find 
the heart of Scorpio, and alters everything. 
Truth, where's the truth? 
I too was an archer in the war; 
my fate: that of a man who missed his target. 

Lyric nightingale, 
on a night like this, by the shore of Proteus, 
the Spartan slave-girls heard you and began their lament, 
and among them -- who would have believed it? -- Helen! 
She whom we hunted so many years by the banks of the Scamander. 
She was there, at the desert's lip; I touched her; she spoke to me: 
It isn't true, it isn't true,' she cried. 
I didn't board the blue bowed ship. 
I never went to valiant Troy.' 

Breasts girded high, the sun in her hair, and that stature 
shadows and smiles everywhere, 
on shoulders, thighs and knees; 
the skin alive, and her eyes 
with the large eyelids, 
she was there, on the banks of a Delta. 
                                                         And at Troy? 
At Troy, nothing: just a phantom image. 
That's how the gods wanted it. 
And Paris, Paris lay with a shadow as though it were a solid being; 
and for ten whole years we slaughtered ourselves for Helen. 

Great suffering had desolated Greece. 
So many bodies thrown 
into the jaws of the sea, the jaws of the earth 
so many souls 
fed to the millstones like grain. 
And the rivers swelling, blood in their silt, 
all for a linen undulation, a filmy cloud, 
a butterfly's flicker, a wisp of swan's down, 
an empty tunic -- all for a Helen. 
And my brother? 
                         Nightingale nightingale nightingale, 
what is a god? What is not a god? And what is there in between them? 

The nightingales won't let you sleep in Platres.' 

Tearful bird, 
                  on sea-kissed Cyprus 
consecrated to remind me of my country, 
I moored alone with this fable, 
if it's true that it is a fable, 
if it's true that mortals will not again take up 
the old deceit of the gods; 
                                       if it's true 
that in future years some other Teucer, 
or some Ajax or Priam or Hecuba, 
or someone unknown and nameless who nevertheless saw 
a Scamander overflow with corpses, 
isn't fated to hear 
messengers coming to tell him 
that so much suffering, so much life, 
went into the abyss 
all for an empty tunic, all for a Helen.





The Companions in Hades
 

fools, who ate the cattle of Helios Hyperion;  but he deprived them of the day of their return.  -- Odyssey 
Since we still had some hardtack 
how stupid of us 
to go ashore and eat 
the Sun's slow cattle, 

for each was a castle 
you'd have to battle 
forty years, till you'd become 
a hero and a star! 

On the earth's back we hungered, 
but when we'd eaten well 
we fell to these lower regions 
mindless and satisfied.





Erotikos Logos
 

I 

Rose of fate, you looked for ways to wound us 
yet you bent like the secret about to be released 
and the command you chose to give us was beautiful 
and your smile was like a ready sword. 

The ascent of your cycle livened creation 
from your thorn emerged the way's thought 
our impulse dawned naked to possess you 
the world was easy: a simple pulsation. 



          II 

The secrets of the sea are forgotten on the shores 
the darkness of the depths is forgotten in the surf; 
the corals of memory suddenly shine purple. . . 
O do not stir. . . listen to hear its light 

motion. . . you touched the tree with the apples 
the hand reached out, the thread points the way and guides you. . . 
O dark shivering in the roots and the leaves 
if it were but you who would bring the forgotten dawn! 

May lilies blossom again on the meadow of separation 
may days open mature, the embrace of the heavens, 
may those eyes alone shine in the glare 
the pure soul be outlined like the song of a flute. 

Was it night that shut its eyes? Ashes remain, 
as from the string of a bow a choked hum remains, 
ash and dizziness on the black shore 
and dense fluttering imprisoned in surmise. 

Rose of the wind, you knew but took us unknowing 
at a time when thought was building bridges 
so that fingers would knit and two fates pass by 
and spill into the low and rested light. 



          III 

O dark shivering in the roots and the leaves! 
Come forth sleepless form in the gathering silence 
raise your head from your cupped hands 
so that your will be done and you tell me again 

the words that touched and merged with the blood like an embrace; 
and let your desire, deep like the shade of a walnut tree, bend 
and flood us with your lavish hair 
from the down of the kiss to the leaves of the heart. 

You lowered your eyes and you had the smile 
that masters of another time humbly painted. 
Forgotten reading from an ancient gospel, 
your words breathed and your voice was gentle: 

The passing of time is soft and unworldly 
and pain floats lightly in my soul 
dawn breaks in the heavens, the dream remains afloat 
and it's as if scented shrubs were passing. 

With my eyes' startling, with my body's blush 
a flock of doves awakens and descends 
their low, circling flight entangles me 
the stars are a human touch on my breast. 

I hear, as in a sea shell, the distant 
adverse and confused lament of the world 
but these are moments only, they disappear, 
and the two-branched thought of my desire reigns alone. 

It seemed I'd risen naked in a vanished recollection 
when you came, strange and familiar, my beloved 
to grant me, bending, the boundless deliverance 
I was seeking from the wind's quick sistrum. . .' 

The broken sunset declined and was gone 
and it seemed a delusion to ask for the gifts of the sky. 
You lowered your eyes. The moon's thorn blossomed 
and you became afraid of the mountain's shadows. 

. . . In the mirror how our love diminishes 
in sleep the dreams, school of oblivion 
in the depths of time, how the heart contracts 
and vanishes in the rocking of a foreign embrace. . . 



          IV 

Two serpents, beautiful, apart, tentacles of separation 
crawl and search, in the night of the trees, 
for a secret love in hidden bowers; 
sleepless they search, they neither drink nor eat. 

Circling, twisting, their insatiable intent 
spins, multiplies, turns, spreads rings on the body 
which the laws of the starry dome silently govern, 
stirring its hot, irrepressible frenzy. 

The forest stands as a shivering pillar for night 
and the silence is a silver cup where moments fall 
echoes distinct, whole, a careful chisel 
sustained by carved lines. . . 

The statue suddenly dawns. But the bodies have vanished 
in the sea in the wind in the sun in the rain. 
So the beauties nature grants us are born 
but who knows if a soul hasn't died in the world. 

The parted serpents must have circled in fantasy 
(the forest shimmers with birds, shoots, blossoms) 
their wavy searching still remains, 
like the turnings of the cycle that bring sorrow. 



          V 

Where is the double-edged day that had changed everything? 
Won't there be a navigable river for us? 
Won't there be a sky to drop refreshing dew 
for the soul benumbed and nourished by the lotus? 

On the stone of patience we wait for the miracle 
that opens the heavens and makes all things possible 
we wait for the angel as in the age-old drama 
at the moment when the open roses of twilight 

disappear. . . Red rose of the wind and of fate, 
you remained in memory only, a heavy rhythm 
rose of the night, you passed, undulating purple 
undulation of the sea. . . The world is simple. 


                                          Athens, October '29--December '30





Letter of Mathios Paskalis
 

The skyscrapers of New York will never know the coolness that comes down on Kifisia 
but when I see the two cypress trees above your familiar church 
with the paintings of the damned being tortured in fire and brimstone 
then I recall the two chimneys behind the cedars I used to like so much when I was abroad. 

All through March rheumatism wracked your lovely loins and in summer you went to Aidipsos. 
God! what a struggle it is for life to keep going, as though it were a swollen river passing through the eye of a needle. 
Heavy heat till nightfall, the stars discharging midges, I myself drinking bitter lemonades and still remaining thirsty; 
Moon and movies, phantoms and the suffocating pestiferous harbour. 

Verina, life has ruined us, along with the Attic skies and the intellectuals clambering up their own heads 
and the landscapes reduced by drought and hunger to posing 
like young men selling their souls in order to wear a monocle 
like young girls -- sunflowers swallowing their heads so as to become lilies. 

The days go by slowly; my own days circulate among the clocks dragging the second hand in tow. 
Remember how we used to twist breathless through the alleys so as not to be gutted by the headlights of cars. 
The idea of the world abroad enveloped us and closed us in like a net 
and we left with a sharp knife hidden within us and you said Harmodios and Aristogeiton'. 

Verina, lower your head so that I can see you, though even if I were to see you I'd want to look beyond. 
What's a man's value? What does he want and how will he justify his existence at the Second Coming? 
Ah, to find myself on a derelict ship lost in the Pacific Ocean alone with the sea and the wind 
alone and without a wireless or strength to fight the elements. 



                                                      Kokkinaras, 5 August 1928





Epiphany, 1937
 

The flowering sea and the mountains in the moon's waning 
the great stone close to the Barbary figs and the asphodels 
the jar that refused to go dry at the end of day 
and the closed bed by the cypress trees and your hair 
golden; the stars of the Swan and that other star, Aldebaran. 

I've kept a rein on my life, kept a rein on my life, travelling 
among yellow trees in driving rain 
on silent slopes loaded with beech leaves, 
no fire on their peaks; it's getting dark. 
I've kept a rein on my life; on your left hand a line 
a scar at your knee, perhaps they exist 
on the sand of the past summer perhaps 
they remain there where the north wind blew as I hear 
an alien voice around the frozen lake. 
The faces I see do not ask questions nor does the woman 
bent as she walks giving her child the breast. 
I climb the mountains; dark ravines; the snow-covered 
plain, into the distance stretches the snow-covered plain, they ask nothing 
neither time shut up in dumb chapels nor 
hands outstretched to beg, nor the roads. 
I've kept a rein on my life whispering in a boundless silence 
I no longer know how to speak nor how to think; whispers 
like the breathing of the cypress tree that night 
like the human voice of the night sea on pebbles 
like the memory of your voice saying happiness'. 

I close my eyes looking for the secret meeting-place of the waters 
under the ice the sea's smile, the closed wells 
groping with my veins for those veins that escape me 
there where the water-lilies end and that man 
who walks blindly across the snows of silence. 
I've kept a rein on my life, with him, looking for the water that touches you 
heavy drops on green leaves, on your face 
in the empty garden, drops in the motionless reservoir 
striking a swan dead in its white wings 
living trees and your eyes riveted. 

This road has no end, has no relief, however hard you try 
to recall your childhood years, those who left, those 
lost in sleep, in the graves of the sea, 
however much you ask bodies you've loved to stoop 
under the harsh branches of the plane trees there 
where a ray of the sun, naked, stood still 
and a dog leapt and your heart shuddered, 
the road has no relief; I've kept a rein on my life. 

                                                                        The snow 
and the water frozen in the hoofmarks of the horses.





Our Sun
 

This sun was mine and yours; we shared it. 
Who's suffering behind the golden silk, who's dying? 
A woman beating her dry breasts cried out: Cowards, 
they've taken my children and torn them to shreds, you've killed them 
gazing at the fire-flies at dusk with a strange look, 
lost in blind thought.' 
The blood was drying on a hand that a tree made green, 
a warrior was asleep clutching the lance that cast light against his side. 

It was ours, this sun, we saw nothing behind the gold embroidery 
then the messengers came, dirty and breathless, 
stuttering unintelligible words 
twenty days and nights on the barren earth with thorns only 
twenty days and nights feeling the bellies of the horses bleeding 
and not a moment's break to drink the rain-water. 
You told them to rest first and then to speak, the light had dazzled you. 
They died saying We don't have time', touching some rays of the sun. 
You'd forgotten that no one rests. 

A woman howled Cowards', like a dog in the night. 
Once she would have been beautiful like you 
with wet mouth, veins alive beneath the skin, 
with love. 

This sun was ours; you kept all of it, you wouldn't follow me. 
And it was then I found out about those things behind the gold and the silk: 
we don't have time. The messengers were right.





Hard Rock Returns to Prison from the Hospital for the Criminal Insane
 

Hard Rock / was / "known not to take no shit 
From nobody, and he had the scars to prove it: 
Split purple lips, lumbed ears, welts above 
His yellow eyes, and one long scar that cut 
Across his temple and plowed through a thick 
Canopy of kinky hair. 

The WORD / was / that Hard Rock wasn't a mean nigger 
Anymore, that the doctors had bored a hole in his head, 
Cut out part of his brain, and shot electricity 
Through the rest. When they brought Hard Rock back, 
Handcuffed and chained, he was turned loose, 
Like a freshly gelded stallion, to try his new status. 
And we all waited and watched, like a herd of sheep, 
To see if the WORD was true. 

As we waited we wrapped ourselves in the cloak 
Of his exploits: "Man, the last time, it took eight 
Screws to put him in the Hole. "Yeah, remember when he 
Smacked the captain with his dinner tray? "He set 
The record for time in the Hole--67 straight days! 
"Ol Hard Rock! man, that's one crazy nigger. 
And then the jewel of a myth that Hard Rock had once bit 
A screw on the thumb and poisoned him with syphilitic spit. 

The testing came, to see if Hard Rock was really tame. 
A hillbilly called him a black son of a bitch 
And didn't lose his teeth, a screw who knew Hard Rock 
From before shook him down and barked in his face. 
And Hard Rock did nothing. Just grinned and looked silly, 
His eyes empty like knot holes in a fence. 

And even after we discovered that it took Hard Rock 
Exactly 3 minutes to tell you his first name, 
We told ourselves that he had just wised up, 
Was being cool; but we could not fool ourselves for long, 
And we turned away, our eyes on the ground. Crushed. 
He had been our Destroyer, the doer of things 
We dreamed of doing but could not bring ourselves to do, 
The fears of years, like a biting whip, 
Had cut deep bloody grooves 
Across our backs.





A Wasp Woman Visits a Black Junkie in Prison
 

After explanations and regulations, he 
Walked warily in. 
Black hair covered his chin, subscribing to 
Villainous ideal. 
"This can not be real, he thought, "this is a 
Classical mistake; 
This is a cake baked with embarrassing icing; 
Somebody's got 
Likely as not, a big fat tongue in cheek! 
What have I to do 
With a prim and proper-blooded lady? 
Christ in deed has risen 
When a Junkie in prison visits with a Wasp woman. 

"Hold your stupid face, man, 
Learn a little grace, man; drop a notch the sacred shield. 
She might have good reason, 
Like: I was in prison and ye visited me not,' or--some such. 
So sweep clear 
Anachronistic fear, fight the fog, 
And use no hot words. 

After the seating 
And the greeting, they fished for a denominator, 
Common or uncommon; 
And could only summon up the fact that both were human. 
"Be at ease, man! 
Try to please, man!--the lady is as lost as you: 
You got children, Ma'am?' he said aloud. 

The thrust broke the dam, and their lines wiggled in the water. 
She offered no pills 
To cure his many ills, no compact sermons, but small 
And funny talk: 
"My baby began to walk... simply cannot keep his room clean... 
Her chatter sparked no resurrection and truly 
No shackles were shaken 
But after she had taken her leave, he walked softly, 
And for hours used no hot words.





For Freckle-Faced Gerald
 

Now you take ol Rufus. He beat drums, 
was free and funky under the arms, 
fucked white girls, jumped off a bridge 
(and thought nothing of the sacrilege), 
he copped out--and he was over twenty-one. 

Take Gerald. Sixteen years hadn't even done 
a good job on his voice. He didn't even know 
how to talk tough, or how to hide the glow 
of life before he was thrown in as "pigmeat 
for the buzzards to eat. 

Gerald, who had no memory or hope of copper hot lips-- 
or firm upthrusting thighs 
to reinforce his flow,

of his river from south to north. 

(No safety in numbers, like back on the block:

plus, Gerald could never quite win 
with his precise speech and innocent grin

Gerald, sun-kissed ten thousand times on the nose

didn't even know that the loss of his balls 
had been plotted years in advance 
by wiser and bigger buzzards than those 
who now hover above his track 
and at night light upon his back.





For Malcolm, A Year After
 

Compose for Red a proper verse; 
Adhere to foot and strict iamb; 
Control the burst of angry words 
Or they might boil and break the dam. 
Or they might boil and overflow 
And drench me, drown me, drive me mad. 
So swear no oath, so shed no tear, 
And sing no song blue Baptist sad. 
Evoke no image, stir no flame, 
And spin no yarn across the air. 
Make empty anglo tea lace words-- 
Make them dead white and dry bone bare. 

Compose a verse for Malcolm man, 
And make it rime and make it prim. 
The verse will die--as all men do-- 
but not the memory of him! 
Death might come singing sweet like C, 
Or knocking like the old folk say, 
The moon and stars may pass away, 
But not the anger of that day.





A Fable
 

Once upon a today and yesterday and nevermore there were 7 men and women all locked / up in prison cells. Now these 7 men and women were innocent of any crimes; they were in prison because their skins were black. Day after day, the prisoners paced their cells, pining for their freedom. And the non-black jailers would laugh at the prisoners and beat them with sticks and throw their food on the floor. Finally, prisoner #1 said, "I will educate myself and emulate the non-colored people. That is the way to freedom--c'mon, you guys, and follow me. "Hell, no, said prisoner #2. "The only way to get free is to pray to my god and he will deliver you like he delivered Daniel from the lion's den, so unite and follow me. "Bullshit, said prisoner #3. "The only way / out is thru this tunnel i've been quietly digging, so c'mon, and follow me. "Uh-uh, said prisoner #4, "that's too risky. The only right / way is to follow all the rules and don't make the non-colored people angry, so c'mon brothers and sisters and unite behind me.   "Fuck you! said prisoner #5, "The only way / out is to shoot our way out, if all of you get / together behind me. "No, said prisoner #6, "all of you are incorrect; you have not analyzed the political situation by my scientific method and historical meemeejeebee. All we have to do is wait long enough and the bars will bend from their own inner rot. That is the only way. "Are all of you crazy, cried prisoner #7. "I'll get out by myself, by ratting on the rest of you to the non-colored people. That is the way, that is the only way! "No-no, they / all cried, "come and follow me. I have the / way, the only way to freedom. And so they argued, and to this day they are still arguing; and to this day they are still in their prison cells, their stomachs / trembling with fear.





Apology for Apostasy?
 

Soft songs, like birds, die in poison air 
So my song cannot now be candy. 
Anger rots the oak and elm; roses are rare, 
Seldom seen through blind despair. 

And my murmur cannot be heard 
Above the din and damn. The night is full 
Of buggers and bastards; no moon or stars 
Light the sky. And my candy is deferred 

Till peacetime, when my voice shall be light, 
Like down, lilting in the air; then shall I 
Sing of beaches, white in the magic sun, 
And of moons and maidens at midnight.





Last Words by "Slick
 

(or a self / sung eulogy)
Now, when I / die, dont you bury me 
On no lone prairie; 
And dont put me in no plain pine box 
(cause I left plenty cold cash!); 
And throw my cold butt in the deep blue see. 
Whatever you do, dont plant me / in no six feet of dirt; 
Just mash me, mash me, except for my dick, 
Which I want wrapped in a white / woman's skirt. 

I dont want no preacher / man a-preaching 
Over me--cause I know where I am going. 
I dont want no tears, no flowers, 
No standing around and waiting / up / all hours. 
Just get a golden trumpet, and have Dizzy blow it. 
Cause I / wuz / Slick--and you damn well know it. 

No piano playing, no blues please; 
No moaning and groaning; 
Just lay me on the table, mash me 
Into my two-hundred-dollar suit, 
Red socks, black patent leather shoes, 
Polka-dot tie (make damn sure it's silk-- 
And dont forget it!) 

Take me out to my pink cadillac 
Prop me up / under the steering wheel, 
Tow me out to real high hill, 
Dig a hole--twenty feet long and twenty feet wide, 
Place a giant joint of reefer / weed by my side; 
Then leave me alone-- 
And let me drive to hell in style!

The Carpenter
 

1    I look at my hands 
      In a dark hour. 
      They are my wife, 
      Another life, 
      Fawnal, 
      Explicitly made. 
      I compare responsibility 
      To journey: 
      They are pitch-black 
      Whirling in the outside world 
      Left behind like a native-- 
      Possessed. 

2    We are older: 
      Toil is our long way 
      Back home. 
      It works. 
      Causes the space to beat 
      Like a heart. 
      It is a part of the poem 
      That appears 
      And appears on its own. 
      It goes on 
      On its own, 
      Mystical as evil 
      But, it is called freedom. 

3    I'm sorry: 
      I was telling you about my hands. 
      How well we are married. 
      It follows, 
      I recognize all truth 
      As some part of ten. 
      Spirit is my thumb, 
      Passionately. 
      Without thumb 
      I would be nothing. 
      I have met some who believe in reason. 
      They have had too much wine, 
      Confess cause and effect-- 
      It has been painful. 

4    I told you it is unreasonable: 
      I guess I should say here, 
      I am your carpenter. 
      Ethnically, dark wood 
      Is my life. 
      I could show you my story better, 
      Sanding, 
      Then where I speak 
      You would hear 
                     Africa 
                     Africa 
      One more thing, my love. 
      I have discovered in this dark wood 
      A skill you have called our loneliness. 
      I sand it down for you 
      Until our bodies fall off.

Dear Folks, 

(Smile) 
Enclosed, is the Ordinary River. 
It is called "That Devil, 
In whose name the locals are baptized. 
Finally that river twists 
Like a hurt thing-- 
They say it's nothing. 
It has become a new road 
In a naked place. 
Then, I am nothing 
And it is that dream 
I dreamed I dreamed. 

               Sincerely,

I have just passed "Doubt, 
It is near "Milk Teeth, 
And "Nothing, and "Falling Out. 
There are flowers and evidence 
Of ambiguous winds. 
"Doubt is like a man 
Walking in his sleep, seriously. 
Offhand, it reminds me 
Of a Jamesian novel 
With the motives, the motives, the motives. 

               Have Mercy,

               Say, 

To get to Innocence, 
You take the narrow trail 
From Deep. 
You squeeze into the mountain's waves. 
If you meet savage rock, 
It is the wrong way. 
Turn left. . . 
There, then, in our hearts' 
Honeymoon, lay I.

I seem to see,

Of my heart. 
There is no museum here, 
And in a convertible, 
Where birds can sing, 
Anything is possible.

And are always reborn 
Is a magnificent horn 
And the strangely uneven voice 
Of her life

               Bill, 

I checked this out. . . 
You know that ridge up there 
Is north, because you know 
For no reason (except this). 
A great wind blows. 
Behind it, the stars come out 
Virtually human. 
And here you are, apparently 
Crude, like the sound 
Of a breaking string 
That seems to come from the sky. 

               So Long,





Grand Illusion
 

My father had several times expressed a fear of being  buried alive. I insisted that the doctor should do whatever  was necessary. The doctor asked me to leave the  room. When I came back, he was able to assure me that  Renoir was dead!   jean renoir
It is not 1937 for long. A clump of ash trees and a walk 
Down the the boathouse: inside linen is tacked up 
In a long blank mural; the children sit on the wings 
Of the dry dock, and then, over the water in a circle 
Of rowboats, the aunts and uncles wait while 
At their center the projectionist, Jean Renoir, 
On a cedar raft, casts silhouettes of rabbits, birds, 
And turtles for the sleepy children. Corks 
Come out of old bottles, it is a few minutes past sunset 
And, now, a swimmer beside the raft looks 

Into the boathouse to the linens: at last, it is 1915! 
A bird screams over the lake, two bats 
Flitter back and forth through the beam of the lamp, 
Interrupting the images, the grand illusion, cast over 
Water the the acceptance of white tablecloths 
On the darkening shore of the lake. A torch is lit 
For its kerosene smoke is repugnant to the swarming insects. 
This film and its prisoners exist between extreme borders, 
Not music and algebra but 
A war and, then, yet another war. . . 

But we begin with the captured officers digging 
A tunnel that will soon be outside the garden wall. 
The Boches observe the Frenchmen working 
With their hoes as from the trousers of a boy 
Dirt from the tunnel secretly spills onto horse manure! 
The prisoners dream of crossing a meadow filled 
With snow, in the moonlight it is jade-green snow 
While Germans with rifles on a hill 
Are unable to kill them, for they have escaped 
Into Switzerland with its feather-brushed trees 

And patina of copper rooftops along a hillside village. 
Isn't this the ending of the film? 
No! I'm sorry but 
There is a single blossom 
On the geranium, and when it falls, Captain de Boeldieu 
Dies, discovering his afterlife along a November road-- 
He does not know that two men are hiding in the marsh 
Beside him; nevertheless, it is at this moment that the film 
Suffers its true conclusion. The two men hiding 
In the marsh will escape across the border, only 
To be returned to the continuing war. This is why there 
Is no importance to your version of the story. And there 
Will be another war. And more horror for the geranium! 
So, to pass the time, the imprisoned soldiers receive 
A steamer trunk filled with women's clothing, 
They will all perform in a revue: a chorus 
Of boys and men, rouge and talcum, black stockings, 
Garters, the tonneau dresses, false breasts and 
Large paper carnations riding up like epaulets 

On their broad shoulders. These poignant inversions 
Are not ridiculous: the third boy from the right 
Has delicate milky thighs, these women are not ridiculous 
Until they begin to stiffen into men as they sing, 
In this comedy, their national anthem! The Russian 
Prisoners have been given a trunk, also, from their 
Mysterious Czarina; the men open it expecting vodka 
And sausages. The box is filled with straw 
And books on cooking, painting, and algebra. In disgust 
They burn these books--kiss good-bye the frontier 

Of algebra and the desire for wedding tripe! 
Now, these officers who are escape artists are moved 
As an elite corps and north to Wintersborn. Later, 
They are taken to a damp limestone castle   
From which no one will escape. The Commandant 
Is the stoic aristocrat, Rauffenstein, his head is in 
A brace like a white egg in a silver teaspoon. 
I mean no disrespect, but the balding Rauffenstein is 
An abject picture of suffering. His villa has but one 
Flower, a tall laden geranium. 

Rauffenstein and the other aristocrat, Boeldieu, 
Are friends. Both would know that to clear a monocle 
One uses spirits of vinegar. They stand confirmed 
In manner beside a squirrel cage. Rauffenstein feels 
Superior to the other two principals, the rich 
Jew, Rosenthal, and the charming emotional Marechal. 
These two hide in the marsh while Boeldieu dies 
Of a bullet wound. Only a king may kill a king! 
And Rauffenstein did it with his pistol; taking aim 
But missing the leg; he severed in three places 
Boeldieu's intestine! 

The Captain is given a room in the turret that holds 
The flowering geranium. Now comes the oratio obliqua 
Of the marksman, Rauffenstein; the disfigured Commandant 
Is sincerely saddened 
At having killed the noble Captain. But before 
The shooting and escape we sensed the Captain's 
Sacrifice was not sacrifice, or suicide, but 
The grand escape--a country road into another landscape. . . 
There are bells tolling down in the village. 
Rosenthal and Marechal with ropes have dropped 

Past the castle's battlements to the ground. 
They run away across snowy farmland. Marechal's teeth 
Are stained from chewing licorice-flavored tobacco. 
Rosenthal and Marechal are extremes who have 
Strong feelings for each other. They are befriended 
By a German widow, Ulsa, and her daughter, Lotte; 
Ulsa sleeps with the tall handsome Jew. He promises 
To return for her when the war is over. He 
Will lose both his legs at Mgglise. 
This is not known within the story, but he'll bleed 

To death beside a little bridge. He lived his illusion 
In the Orient of Delacroix, his servants were Syrians 
And Negroes. He loved the little ivory spoons that 
Chinese women in the open markets use to bathe 
And freshen the exotic tiny fish they sell out 
Of huge clay bowls. . . 
In the boathouse the children sleep, while Jean's 
Oldest cousin, drunken, falls out of a rowboat. 
The lone swimmer has joined Renior on the raft. 
The film now reveals the first diversion 
As all of the prisoners of the fortress begin playing 
Several hundred wooden flutes, the noise is like women 
Crying over the fresh mounds at Verdun. This diversion 
Is not illusion 
And as the Boches collect the flutes, the drunken cousin 
Tries to join Renior on the raft. Boeldieu flees 
To the heights of the castle, the second diversion! 
We hear: Halt! Halt! Halt! 
A gunshot, and chowder with blood falls from Boeldieu's 
Opened stomach all the way down to the courtyard. 

There are small fish bones in the viscera on the cobbled 
Courtyard floor. Scissors cut the blue blossom 
From the geranium. Boeldieu will die. . . dead,   
He awakens on a country road where, now a peasant, 
He walks a white horse under the looming, bare trees. 
Rosenthal and Marechal are watching 
As they hide in the dead marsh flowers of 
An early November. They are alive. They do not 
Recognize their friend. Renoir's cousin, asking for 
More wine, climbing onto the raft, spills 

Everything, and the projector with its crude lamp 
Sinks slowly to the bottom of the lake-- 
Its dusky lighted windows like a bathysphere 
Lost off a cable that frayed, whoever is alive 
Inside the iron bell is experiencing 
An eternal falling through water without the promise 
Of a bottom. . . it's 1937, the children 
Asleep in the boathouse are being aroused, they wake 
To a bat caught in the wall of linen, they think it's 
Their uncle still casting images of animals for them. . .





Like van Gogh, I Cant Begin in Prose
 

1    Dear Milton, 

      Rain. But when you are here, alone, what does it 
      mean. It means psalm -- that song sung to the harp. 
      Like trees, we too hold on to the earth -- pull and 
      twang for another tongue. It (whatever it is, and 
      who knows that) is a sacred song. It is strange for 
      we are the ones who glorify mystery with our arms. 
      We call it testament because it pries at our souls 
      with many branches, and so you say with a huge 
      eye, we must practice our art like the third stomach 
      of a cud-chewing animal: 

                     "Myrtle, Woodbine, Appletrees, Trillium, 
                      here they are, the strength of your arm 
                      stalls at the open gate of the stars. 

                      Feel everything, trust everything! 

         We are always limited to what we ask for (so why 
      not ask for wings). Therefore, desire becomes a flight 
      marker. For surely we hover over what we have done 
      as though we have wings -- looking for signs that will 
      tell us where to go, and if we have gone somewhere, 
      what it means. Milton, like David of old, like David 
      of old or any child, we live on the tip of that lean 
      tongue of invocation with our sling, saying: 

                     "I am small in this bright cataract of pine. 
                      I stand on the smallest stone. 
                      I am a standing prairie dog 
                      praying for my song. 

         And so we have come to know: what is sacred is 
      the storm, how the winds shimmer in the pool. . . 
      how "brushes are frightened. 
         Milton, it is right to say: 

                   "I'm lucky, I'm always lucky. 

      for though 

                     "Now, somewhere, as if I were really holy, 
                     I know that my savior is lonely. 

      you also know 

                     "The wind has given me its child to hold -- 
                     riding on my shoulders with its stars. 

      Of course I'm biased; what's a friend for! But I 
      think you have done what you should have done -- 
      gone to the fountainhead and glorified in psalm. 
         It may please you to know that out there, rain, 
      too, gives in large quantities. 

               Love to family, 


2    Dear Love to Family, 

                     "O mother, momma, 
                      how can I eat this? 
                      My teeth are in my grave, 
                      my promises broken. 

         On that anvil called home, we beat out family. It 
      is enough and lovely to learn from our own. To say, 
      "Grandma Celia. . . to say, "Davey, Davey. . . Paula, 
      my Paula. 
         On that anvil called home, we are like van Gogh 
      -- thinking always in vivid colors that are both silent 
      and raging. For without it we would have no capac- 
      ity for peace -- or war. We would be unable to settle 
      or plan, or to love and fear tales. 
         This is the center that allows us to pass among 
      people -- the beautiful black night with all the stars. . . 


3    Dear Beautiful Black Night with All the Stars, 

      Swimming in the pool it occurs to you, "I am no one 
      else. In this context, completely surrounded, every- 
      thing must live. 


4    Dear Everything Must Live, 

      No country, no culture, no person, can give us more 
      than the "rant of the ordinary life. 


5    Dear Rant of the Ordinary Life, 

      What we hand to our children is our truth. As large 
      as we are, it is small. Fragile in a bed, you learn 
      about infirmity's strong arms: 

                     "What is it? Who's there? 

         Your heart is the real house you breathe in. Old 
      love's fantasy is there; it has young feet: 

                     "It is strange: 
                      I want to weep. 

      We are never at peace. Because, all our work comes 
      back. It spies on us as round as the moon: 

                     "Boy, look at the moon! 
                      Look at that moon! 
                      It looks like it's right 
                      On top of us. 


6    Dear Right on Top of Us, 

      Around us, life and death. Someone born like us -- 
      gone. Blackburn, like a magician's stroke of the 
      wand -- gone. 
         On a freighter, you stare into the water and go to 
      your ancestral home. You think about small Selma, 
      all the occupied zones we are, how our fingertips are 
      almost like birds. 
         Once, when you were a boy, you let go of the 
      fence. You are still falling. 


7    Dear You Are Still Falling, 

      You are a cantor whose strange songs absorb 
      mystery, and that is not sailing too far. 

                So long. . . 

                P.





After That
 

Every story has its lean meat 
and its solid church 
so he started to rape her for years. 
However, owls close their eyes 
in the daytime 
because they're awake all night, 
and she waited for him 
at the handle of his hunting knife 
the bells ringing afterward 
with the kind of lust 
she's always known. 
After that her flights were silent 
and her voice, of rats and mice. 
I don't understand sorcery or omens 
even eyes as penetrating as hers, 
but under her feathers 
and all along the tips of her flight 
where she's let me touch her, 
I've kissed her fright.





Dreamer
 

1    There are few probabilities through 
      Which dreamers do not pass. . . 

      The first dream 
      Is the bright red dream 
      Of our mother's heart. 
      It is her sacrifice 
      Of something eternal 
      In herself, for us. 
      The Arabs say 
      Blood has flowed 
      Let us begin again. 

      The heart is like a cup, or a coffer, 
      or a cave. It holds the image of the 
      sun within us. It is a center of illumination 
      and happiness and wisdom. To dream 
      of the heart is always to dream of 
      the importance of love. . . 

      The second dream is the inauguration 
      Of the soul. In this dream we are 
      Confronted by a host of birds. . . 

      Some were guileless 
      Like the doves, 
      Said Odo of Tusculum, 
      Cunning 
      Like the partridges. 
      Some came to the hand 
      Like the hawks. 
      Others fled from it 
      Like the hens, 
      Some enjoyed the company 
      Of people 
      Like swallows, 
      Others preferred solitude 
      Like the turtledoves, 
      But all eventually flew away. 

      "Living is not necessary, but navigation 
      is, said Pompey the Great. 

      B. 1725, London 
      Mother devout as gunpowder 
      Seemingly clairvoyant 
      Taught her only child 
      To read by four 
      Arithmetic and Latin by six 
      Dies when he is seven. 

      I am dreaming 
      I am in the dark 
      And it is raining 
      And she is the rain. 

      To dream that you are in the dark 
      is a sign of difficulties ahead; if 
      you fall or hurt yourself you can expect 
      a change for the worse, but if you 
      succeed in groping to the light, that 
      is another matter. . . 

      Father, master of ships, 
      Lively in the Mediterranean trade, 
      Unusual qualities -- 
      Educated in Spain, stern. 

      I listen to nothing 
      But the silence 
      Of my father; the dream 
      Says 
      He is the rudder 
      And the compass. 

      If, in your dreams, you see your 
      father and he speaks to you, it is 
      a sign of coming happiness. If he is 
      silent, or if he appears to be ill or 
      dead, then you may expect trouble. . . 

      Sent to sea at ten, 
      Acted like a verb in disagreement, 
      Of course 
      Bright, 
      But no eagle -- 
      A mess. 

      I have vague 
      Dreams now 
      Of intelligent flowers. 
      I cannot say 
      If their roots 
      Are in the ground 
      Or in the air. 

      By seventeen 
      A wildflower 
      In the field of Jesus. 
      Pious, books, fasting, 
      Abstinence from meat, 
      A canon in his meditation 
      And silence, 
      But like the weeds 
      Loved to curse. 

      Flowers, one of nature's best dreams. 
      This foretells great happiness, unless 
      you throw away the blossoms. . . 

      1742 
      A lot more flexible, 
      Falls in love, 
      Misses his ship, 
      A freethinker now, 
      Less of a thorn 
      In the side of God. 

      I dream that I 
      Am always with her, 
      A freckle on her wrist, 
      A flower in her hair, 
      A ridiculous flying fish -- 
      Sliced 
      And dressed 
      And set on the table. 

      As I told you before, 
      He missed his ship, 
      Became a lover 
      Rather than a Jamaican 
      Planter, 
      Father as expected 
      Furious. 

      Love is a dream of contraries as far 
      as sweethearts are concerned. To dream 
      that you do not succeed in love is a 
      sign that you will marry and have 
      a happy life. To dream that you are in 
      the company of your lover is also fortunate. . . 

      Late 1743 
      Kidnapped into the Navy 
      (What else) 
      Coming from Mary's house. 
      Taken from his own life, 
      Focused into new pieces. 

      I dream about my fortune, 
      A fragrance captured 
      In a jar, 
      A freckle without a wrist, 
      A wisp 
      Foxlike at the edge 
      Of the wind. 

      Fortune is a dream of contraries: the more 
      fortunate and successful you are in imagination, 
      the greater will be your real struggles. . . 

      How do we fit together 
      When we are not free? 
      What kind of animal are we? 
      How many heads do we have? 
      How many tails? 
      The sea 
      Is a strange piece of property 
      On which to discuss this, 

      On the hms Hardwick 
      One month later 
      Midshipman John Newton: 
      I have eaten war 
      Like a cluster 
      Of delicious fruit. 
      The ironic juices 
      Running from my lips 
      That was my dream. 

      The reality of war is the dream of it. Beware 
      of those things that appear so friendly 
      but have no reason. . . 

      1774 
      The Hardwick 
      Ordered to the East Indies. 
      First our hero visits Mary again. 
      (You're wrong) 
      Almost misses ship, 
      Completely misses the point. 
      Given small boat of men 
      To go ashore at Plymouth, 
      Deserts. 

      My dreams here 
      Were father, compass, 
      Fog, leakage, 
      And ultimately, learning, 
      With us 
      Like our laundry. 

      We are always pulling from our past. Fossils 
      are the dream of the sickness of someone 
      you have not met for a long time. When 
      this happens brew herbs, add honey 
      and lemon, sip and inhale deeply. . . 

      Captured like a frog, 
      Returned, put in irons, 
      Stripped, flogged, degraded, 
      Returned to foremast. 

      This is that point many people would 
      call a black moment, an unfortunate 
      color on things. I will not do that. For 
      black is a contrary at funerals and our 
      hero has just died a little as we 
      all tend to from time to time. And even 
      though that is true I will not do 
      that either. I will not talk of the great 
      white moment of death, I will not talk 
      of the great blue and purple moments 
      in the prosperity of pain. I will not 
      talk of the great red or scarlet moments 
      of quarrels and loss of friends, or 
      the crimson pleasure of the unexpected, 
      the mental tints of yellow and orange 
      that show you should always expect 
      change, or the feeling of knowing green 
      because you have been on a long journey. 
      All the colors are conjurers when our 
      mysteries are being solved. And if this could 
      not be his dream then by now it should 
      be ours. . . 

      We are not holy 
      The wind says in the sails 
      As he works. 
      It has never been otherwise 
      Though we live in the most 
      Devout of stories like litmus paper 
      Constantly changing color 
      Just to prove something 
      Is happening. 

      The sadness in his dream is a good omen 
      for the future. It is a quest for lasting joy, 
      and so is punishment a dream of unexpected 
      pleasure. . . 

      Works quietly for weeks. 
      His silence 
      Darns a temperate 
      Healing thread 
      His eyes 
      Become an elaborate 
      Decorative art 
      Avoiding everyone. 

      "Every month, said Cicero 
      "the moon contemplates 
      its trajectory 
      and the shrubs 
      and animals grow. 

      He has done to himself 
      What is easy. 
      He must now blossom 
      Out of his new secrets 
      Even if joy is ephemeral. 

      Suddenly 
      He begins to sing, 
      Creates songs about fish 
      And clouds. 

      Fish are a dream of penetrative motion, 
      clouds are a dream of appearances always 
      in a state of change. . . 

      We must be patient 
      With the overfecundity 
      Of his youth. 
      We must let him 
      Climb and descend the mast 
      Like a weapon. 
      Trade him 
      To a slaver's ship 
      To subdue the threat 
      To discipline 
      In his strangely awakening 
      Joy. 
      We must let him 
      Choose his monsters 
      And the myths 
      Of his own worth -- 
      The enemy always being 
      The forces threatening 
      From within. 

      Paul said, "We wrestle not against flesh 
      and blood, but against principalities, against 
      powers, against the rulers of the darkness 
      of this world, against spiritual wickedness in 
      high places. . . 

      Suddenly, 
      Begins to breathe 
      Different songs 
      In his six-months' stay 
      Along the Sierra Leone coast. 
      Troublesome songs, 
      Songs of quick wit 
      And devastating rhymes 
      Ridiculing ship's officers, 
      Crew loves them, 
      Becomes a choir. 

      To dream that you hear other people 
      singing shows that the difficulties 
      that will come for you will come through 
      your dealings with other people. . . 

      The irate mate 
      Assuming command 
      After the death of the captain 
      Threatens 
      To put Newton 
      On a man-o'-war. 

      The Royal Navy is not an obstacle dream; 
      it is an elaborate exhibition of the 
      nuances of living death. . . 
      Occupation: slave dealer 
      Place: Sierra Leone 
      On one of the Plantanes 
      Features: Short, white male 
      Name: Clow 
      Other information: Black wife 
      Name: sounds like P.I. 

      John Newton 
      Bargains his life 
      Into this extravagant story. 
      He will become a slave 
      Because P.I. will hate him. 
      He will become ill 
      With fever. 
      He will be denied 
      Food, 
      Denied water, 
      Tormented by Black slaves 
      On command, 
      Put to work 
      On a lime tree plantation 
      Enjoying only the scents 
      And dreaming 
      Of his earthly desires, 
      Will master the six books 
      Of Euclid, 
      Drawing the diagrams 
      With a long stick 
      In the wet sand. 

      Six is, like two, a particularly ambiguous 
      number to dream about, but it 
      establishes equilibrium. It unifies 
      the triangles of fire and water and 
      symbolizes the human soul. Six is 
      the hermaphrodite, a personality integrated 
      despite its duality. 

      If this is a story 
      Of the reasoning of slavery, 
      Where are we? 
      What have we been doing 
      To people, 
      To the light 
      From which life emanates? 

      Slavery is a story 
      Of procreation, 
      Of magic religious thinking, 
      Of the androgynous divinity 
      Within us. 
      No story can be this happy 
      Unless it is married 
      To something deeply within us. 
      It is not them 
      Who have done it to us, 
      Or us 
      Who have done it to them. 
      It is the antagonistic dream 
      Of unreconciled love. 

      To dream of erotic love is to dream of 
      the desire to die in the object of desire, to 
      dissolve in that which is already 
      dissolved. The Book of Baruch says erotic 
      desire and its satisfaction is the key 
      to the origin of the world. Disappointment 
      in love and the revenge which follows 
      in its wake are the roots of all the evil 
      and selfishness in the world. The whole 
      of history is the work of love. 

2    "The character of the image, said Shukrchrya, 
      "is determined by the relationship between 
      the worshipper and the worshipped. 

      On the beach, 
      He eats the fruit 
      Of his own way; 
      He fills himself 
      With his own devices; 
      He continues to draw 
      In the sand. 

      Each grain 
      Is a small, 
      Precise form 
      Of salvation 
      That has occurred, 
      A god come to earth 
      In another form, 
      A private, 
      Innate sacrifice. 
      Providence does not tire. 
      We are ready to go on 
      With the story. 

      It has come to this: 
      When his father dreams 
      He only sees 
      The broad face 
      Of sadness, 
      The soft grassland 
      Where only asphodels grow, 
      And the idea of water 
      Expanding into tears. 

      But to dream of sadness is a good 
      omen, a transportation of suffering to the 
      spiritual: this dream is like an herb, 
      a seasoning, a bitter root, medicinal, 
      something poisonous, but nevertheless 
      something that eventually withers away. 

      When you 
      Come on to squally weather, 
      When the wind 
      Is about SW, 
      When 
      You sway up the yard 
      Fix the trysail, 
      Put people to making 
      Sennit and swab, 
      Ask for my son. 
      Ask the Lamb, 
      The Beverly, the Golden Lyon, 
      Ask Job Lewis, 
      Have you seen my boy? 
      Have you seen my boy? 

      One thousand years before Christ, Solomon 
      said that the way of a ship in the midst 
      of the sea was too wonderful for him 
      to understand. 

      Meanwhile, 
      Clow: shamed 
      Into freeing his fellow 
      White man. 
      After all 
      They share the same hair, 
      The same instinctual life, 
      The same irrational power. 
      There is no victim here: 
      This is a story of love's 
      Sadness, 
      Of the spirit of love's ferocity 
      And savage insensibility, 
      And the name of Jesus 
      Turned in hymns, 
      Spewed into the fringes 
      Of the forest, 
      Spewed on the deep blue sea. 

      What dream is this, is that what you said? 
      My God, this is the dream of the dragon, 
      the fabulous animal, the amalgam of 
      aggression, the serpent, the crocodile, the 
      lion, what we like to think is the 
      antediluvian nature of love. 

      John is free now. 
      John is free to slave, 
      Free to be reluctant, 
      To give up profit 
      and return home. 

      Ask the master of the Greyhound. 
      Have you seen my boy? 
      Have you seen my boy? 

      To find money in your dream is not fortunate 
      at all. There will be some sudden advancement 
      or success, but it will prove 
      disappointing. Reader, remember this 
      statement by Virgil, "It will be pleasant 
      to remember these things hereafter. 

      You cannot blame 
      The sea on a woman. 
      Unlike the seasons 
      It has no ribs 
      Though 
      It has a crown, 
      Wears a sheath, 
      Swings a sickle, 
      Adores the sun, 
      And is known 
      As bareheaded and leafless. 
      The sea is the emblem 
      Of the great capricious world; 
      The naked image of flux 
      Vibrating between life and death. 

      There is a dream called "Dire is the tossing 
      deep the groans; come let us heel, list 
      and stoop. And when John heard this 
      on his way home, it was as if he 
      had read 2 Kings 10:16, "Come with me 
      [brother] and see my zeal for the lord. 

      For twelve months 
      The Greyhound 
      Sought gold, 
      Ivory, dyer's wood, 
      Beeswax, 
      And Newton sought the Lord. 

      The way of a ship in the midst of the sea 
      is too wonderful to understand. 

      Youth is not innocence. 
      It is not a militant puzzlement. 
      It is a methodological initiation 
      Into the ubiquitous life 
      Of sin. 
      For a life without sin 
      Is no life at all. 
      And so he wanders on 
      Like Paul, 
      So very Christian about it, 
      At once wretched and delivered. 
      Thinking with his mind 
      He is serving God, 
      But with his flesh 
      The law of sin.

      Call out 
      To Joshua, Ruth, 
      Samuel, Obadiah, 
      Esther, Zechariah, 
      Luke and Timothy. 
      The world 
      Is a masterfully round 
      Secret 
      That embraces everything, 
      And it is time 
      To reach into the horizon, 
      Now. 
      It is time to choose 
      Your ship, 
      And the triangle of your life 
      Upon the salty sea. 

      As you can see, dreams are without reason, 
      without solution, without proof, the 
      unedited version of our love, our aspiration, 
      our hurt. . . Call out John Newton. Call out. . .

      Marriage is the dream of sulfur and 
      mercury. Some believe it is a most fortunate 
      omen, a volatile conciliation, a fragile 
      union. They are right. It is one of the great 
      uncharted seas of individuation. It is 
      said, "If you are separated from your 
      opposite you consume yourself away. . .

      The dream of questions is a bright necklace 
      with two ornaments on it: liberty and 
      love, not truth.

                  Treatment of me. 

      The trouble with atonement is it is like 
      a sphinx, several parts human, several 
      parts bull, dog, lion, dragon, or bird. 
      When we are dreaming of atonement, no 
      matter how subtly, we must remember 
      we are not dreaming of a verb. 

      "I watch them work 
      The tie, tackle,

      Little mystics or snakes. 

      When you dream the dream of square-sail 
      rigging you are dreaming the dream 
      that the same side is always before 
      the wind. At the dawn of Swedish history 
      it was believed Erik Vdderhatt, the 
      King of the Svear, could turn the wind 
      and cruise endlessly. Ships are supposed 
      to be emblems of transcendental joy. . .

      Ever dance 
      Under these circumstances?

      "Dear Mary, 
                  I watched the land wind 
                  Do to the sails 
                  What it does 
                  To our hair. 
                  I dreamed of dancing 
                  With you 
                  Into the cold water, 
                  Our wet clothes

                  Around our desire. 

      They would call them up 
      Two by two, equivocal, 
      Unmasked, 
      Making it possible 
      To be classified 
      Forever: 
      Pairs of birds, 
      Pairs of oxen, 
      Pairs of sheep, 
      Reptiles, lions, 
      Elephants, antediluvian, 
      Carnivorous, herbivorous, 
      Fabulous, beautiful, 
      Ugly, strange, 
      Cocks, locusts, bears, 
      Foxes, and even flies, 
      All of them black; 
      All of them in colonnade 
      To the gates of hell. 

      John did baptize 
      In the wilderness, 
      Did call out to Juda 
      And Jerusalem 
      Come lay down 
      Your life 
      In the River Jordan, 
      Participate in his death 
      And his resurrection. 

      They said 
      They were refreshing them, 
      But the shackles still clanged, 
      And most of them still stank, 
      And many finding holes 
      In the netting 
      Jumped overboard 
      And baptized themselves 
      Bobbing in the adoring 
      Loins of the sea. 

      "Dear Mary, 
                  The three greatest blessings 
                  Of which human nature is capable 
                  Are undoubtedly religion, 
                  Liberty and love. 

      The shape of a ship's hull is determined by 
      the materials, methods of construction, 
      means of propulsion, use, fashion, and 
      whim. This is a dream of law and 
      the minute verities of justice, the eighth 
      enigma of the tarot. 

      First part fair, 
      The latter cloudy, 
      Winds becoming unusual, 
      Clouds dark, great lightning. . . 
      I think of what we've done, 
      My own illumination 
      Before it is too late: 

      The palm and needle whippings, 
      The short splice, 
      Blackwall hitches, 
      Sheet bends. 

      Quickly rummage 
      The rigging details, 
      The yardarm blocks, 
      The tackles. 

      Recall work 
      On the pintles, 
      The rudder head. 

      Have Billinge 
      Check barricado and stores, 
      Especially powder and slaves. 

      On this day 
      Of the second voyage 
      Of The African, 1754, 
      Weighed, 
      Bound by God's permission 
      To St. Christophers, 
      We are ready for our justice, 
      To be winnowed like barley 
      On the threshing floor. 

      The great dream of the dark, with the 
      lonely extroverted lamp, the intuitive ship, 
      and the wind tossing on the innovative sea 
      should moor somewhere. "Why is this 
      so? asked Kuo Hsi. For in our landscapes 
      and our seascapes are the personalized items 
      of our consciousness, the coarse grist 
      of our imagination, the flirtatious metaphors 
      stirring our ethics, and the boldly stroked 
      delineations of our unraveling possibilities 
      and original nature. 

      Through the night 
      We were played with 
      Like kittens. 
      The slaves spilled 
      Out nightmares of themselves 
      And groans. 
      We will all 
      Need dawn's shawl 
      This morning. 
      I hope 
      She is good to us. 

      Osiris was slain by Set and put 
      together again by Isis. John will dream 
      like this, off and on, and then quit the 
      sea. This is his last voyage. He will 
      lose no slaves and no crew, and it will 
      be called a blessing. At a time like 
      this the Egyptians would build a 
      monolith to marry the enigmatic tension 
      between life and death. John will 
      change his dreams, now, from the menstrual 
      dreams of the slaver to the menthol dreams 
      of the minister. Showing the devastating evil 
      we do, like a storm, is only a stepping- 
      stone to something else. 
      Sing brother. 

      I will become sermons, 
      He says, 
      That understand what I've done. 
      Sing 
      I will become hymns 
      Bound in the skin 
      Of what I've done. 
      I will be patient with Cowper, 
      Inspiring to Wilberforce 
                      And Wordsworth; 
      I will attract the awakened crowds, 
      The abolitionist. 
      I will stand at the altar. 
      Sing brother 
      Dressed in black, 
      Testifying, 
      Testifying. . . 

      I dream I will not be forgiving him 
      for the timeliness of his innocence, for 
      betrothing the dead to the dead, 
      but will be lifting 
      up my hands to an appetite for life 
      that will take slavers and slaves with me. 

      I wish 
      There was no timelessness, 
      That slavery was over 
      And so far away 
      It was an incredibly mysterious 
      Jungle -- 
      Somewhere else. 
      An uncharted river 
      Canopied by extensive moss -- 
      Somewhere else. 
      A spectacular ragged 
      Waterfall 
      Mystically expressed 
      Over an enormous 
      Obsidian wall, 
      But it is right here 
      In my pouch, today, 
      Like the acori beads 
      I have been swimming with 
      For hours -- 
      Presidential, prime ministerial, 
      Corporate, grassroots based. 
      Right here, 
      Racist, imperial, and sexist. 
      Right here, 
      Woefully spendthrift 
      And Democratic, 
      Anally retentive 
      And Republican, 
      Militantly inappropriate, 
      And so good to itself 
      That it jogs.





Elizabeths War with the Christmas Bear
 

The bears are kept by hundreds within fences, are fed cracked 
Eggs; the weakest are 
Slaughtered and fed to the others after being scented 
With the blood of deer brought to the pastures by Elizabeth's 
Men--the blood spills from deep pails with bottoms of slate. 

The balding Queen had bear gardens in London and in the country. 
The bear is baited: the nostrils 
Are blown full with pepper, the Irish wolf dogs 
Are starved, then, emptied, made crazy with fermented barley: 

And the bear's hind leg is chained to a stake, the bear 
Is blinded and whipped, kneeling in his own blood and slaver, he is 
Almost instantly worried by the dogs. At the very moment that 
Elizabeth took Essex's head, a giant brown bear 
Stood in the gardens with dogs hanging from his fur. . . 
He took away the sun, took 
A wolfhound in his mouth, and tossed it into 
The white lap of Elizabeth I--arrows and staves rained 

On his chest, and standing, he, then, stood even taller, seeing 
Into the Queen's private boxes--he grinned 
Into her battered eggshell face. 
Another volley of arrows and poles, and opening his mouth 
He showered 
Blood all over Elizabeth and her Privy Council. 

The very next evening, a cool evening, the Queen demanded 
Thirteen bears and the justice of 113 dogs: she slept 

All that Sunday night and much of the next morning. 
Some said she was guilty of this and that. 
The Protestant Queen gave the defeated bear 
A grave in a Catholic cemetery. The marker said: 
Peter, a Solstice Bear, a gift of the Tsarevitch to Elizabeth. 

After a long winter she had the grave opened. The bear's skeleton 
Was cleared with lye, she placed it at her bedside, 
Put a candle inside behind the sockets of the eyes, and, then 
She spoke to it: 

You were a Christmas bear--behind your eyes 
I see the walls of a snow cave where you are a cub still smelling 
Of your mother's blood which has dried in your hair; you have 
Troubled a Queen who was afraid 
When seated in shade which, standing, 
You had created! A Queen who often wakes with a dream 
Of you at night-- 
Now, you'll stand by my bed in your long white bones; alone, you 
Will frighten away at night all visions of bear, and all day 
You will be in this cold room--your constant grin, 
You'll stand in the long, white prodigy of your bones, and you are, 

Every inch of you, a terrible vision, not bear, but virgin!





The Huts at Esquimax
 

for Dave Smith
Our clothes are still wet from wading 
The Chickamunga last evening. 
There is heavy frost. We have 
Walked on the dead all night. 
Now in the firelight 
We are exchanging shells and grapeshot. 

I can still hear our loud huzzah 
When late in the day 
The enemy fell into full retreat 
Along the pine ridge to the east. . . 

We chased them until we were weary. 
Each night this week 
There's been something 
To keep me from sleep. Just an hour ago 
I saw 

A dead sharpshooter sitting 
Against a rock with a scallop 
Of biscuit still lodged in his mouth. 
He wore one silk sock. 

Snedikerhas returned from Chattanooga 
With five thousand convalescents 
For the left wing of their musketry. 

We have roasted a deer 
With a molasses sauce and pepper. 
Magrill and zandt have returned 
From horse hunting with a sack of sugar. 

By morning we will have buried our dead 
And fed the prisoners: Joe Cotton 

Will hang all seven of them in one tree 
When he sees they're done 
Licking their fingers. . . 

I shot a Rebel yesterday 
In high water just for cursing me. 
Just six months ago 
For that alone it would have meant 
Three days in stockade. 

We can see now that cannonading 
Has set the hillside on fire. 
The wounded Grays 
Will be burned 
Beyond their Christian names. . . 

Joe Cotton says he'd ask God 
For rain, but he's got no tent 
And river water 
Has chilled him straight through 

To the very quick of his being.





An Annual of the Dark Physics
 

The Baltic Sea froze in 1307. Birds flew north 
From the Mediterranean in early January. 
There were meteor storms throughout Europe. 

On the first day of Lent 
Two children took their own lives: 
Their bodies 
Were sewn into goatskins 
And were dragged by the hangman's horse 
The three miles down to the sea. 
They were given a simple grave in the sand. 

The following Sunday, Meister Eckhart 
Shouted that a secret word 
Had been spoken to him. He preached 

That Mary Magdalene 
Sought a dead man in the tomb 
But, in her confusion, found 
Only two angels laughing. . . 

This was a consequence of her purity 

And her all too human grief. 
The Baltic Sea 
Also froze in 1303-- 
Nothing happened that was worthy of poetry.





Confession
 

for Hank
The General's men sit at the door. Her eyes 
Are fat with belladonna. She's naked 
Except for the small painted turtles 
That are drinking a flammable cloud 
Of rum and milk from her navel. 

The ships out in the harbor 
Are loosely allied 
Like casks floating in bilge. 
The occasional light on a ship 
Winks. In the empty room of the manuscript 
Someone is grooming you 
For the long entrance into the dark city. 

They'll hang the General. 
Then with torches they'll search for his children. 
Men and women 
Are seen jumping from the burning hotel. 
Journalists, in no hurry, 
Elect to take the elevator. They walk 
Out of the building, stepping over corpses. . . 
You are listening to loud bells. 

The corpses get up and follow the journalists. 
It's unfair that while rehearsing 
For death they actually succumbed to it. 
But no one sobs. 
Shirts and dresses billowing as they fall. 
Something inhuman in you watched it all. 
And whatever it is that watches, 
It has kept you from loneliness like a mob.





Homage to Philip K. Dick
 

for Paul Cook
The illegal ditch riders of the previous night 
Will deliver ice today. 
The barbers up in the trees are Chinese. 
They climb with bright cleats, bearing machetes-- 
It's a season 
Of low self-esteem for date palms on the street. 

My visitor was at the door yesterday. 
In a blue sere of a sucker suit. 
An I Like Ike button 
On the lapel. Holding a cup of sawdust. 
He breathed through his eyes, crusted 
With pollen. 

I was not confused. It was God 
Come to straighten my thoughts. 
Whole celestial vacuums 
In the trunk of his pink Studebaker. 
We would smoke and cough. 
I sat very still, almost at peace with myself. 

He had shot a deer in the mountains. He thought 
Last year's winterkill was worse than usual. 
I told him I didn't know about guns. 
Something forming on his forehead--a gloriole 
Of splattered sun over snow. 
We drank our lemonade in silence. 

He asked if he could go. He joked 
About his wife's tuna casserole. As a gift 
I signed for him my last paperback. 
He left the book of matches. I'll not enroll 
In the correspondence course it offers 
For commercial artists. What a relief 

That the barbers in the trees are Chinese. 
Green fronds are dropping in twos and threes 
Around the bungalow, lessons 
In the etiquette of diseased parrots. Bill Cody 
Said it first, "If there is no God, then I am 
His prophet. Stop it. Please stop it.





Margarets Speech
 

I'm a frogman. Naked by the water 
Under a lean of canvas she'd sewn 
With a thick paraffin thread, 
She gestured. When we pulled him 
From the river 
His left leg was meal. Crayfish in the hair. 
The river bottom left his shoulder 
Layered and crocheted-- 
My sister's pearl knitting needles 
Clicking in my head. I told 
The sheriff I wouldn't do it again. 

I knew him once. His Chevy threw a rod. 
I made it with him 
On the hood of the old truck. 
It was out at the dump beyond Yuma. 
It felt like I had bread crumbs 
All over my mouth. Wacky with the sun, 
I sure did it with him enough 
That afternoon. I didn't 

Know it was him who'd drowned. 
They said it was his cousin. 
He had a three-cornered scar 
At the small of his back. And a deposit 
Of calcium on the tailbone. 
We're not much, you know? 

He was tangled in yellow tree roots, 
He spun in the currents, 
A fishhook and line running 
From his thumb. 
A whole new ball of wax, I thought. 

I wanted to be an astronaut. 
But failed the mathematics 
Twice in one summer. 
So I raise Nubian goats. 
My favorite has a purple manure 
That comes out like steaming packets 
Of tobacco mulch. He sprays 
The shack with his seed-- 
It hasn't needed paint in three years. 

I just took my shorts off 
When you two came down the hill. 
It's that rubber suit I wear 
When I dive into the chute and cave. 
Sometimes I just feel 
Like old air in a patched tire. Then, 
I get my Seagram's and come out here. 
You two look married. Not that I care. 
You wouldn't believe what I was just thinking-- 
Your husband's the only living man 
Left in this country 
Who knows that I bleach my hair.





A Fifteenth-Century Zen Master
 

for Stephen
A blind girl steps over the red staves 
Of a tub. Steam rising from her shoulders and hair, 
She walks across a dirt floor to you. 
I think you are not her grandfather. 
You watch with her a pink man 
Who has avoided taxes for two winters-- 
He is being judged by roosters 
And has been chased this far into the countryside. Above him 

Burning sacks of bat dung are arranged 
In the purple branches of the thistle trees. 
The river is indifferent to him. 
And so are we. 
You tell your mistress the burning bags of shit 
Are like inert buddhas 
Dissolving in a field of merit. 

She giggles. A front tooth is loose. 
With the river bottom clear as the night air, 
The bargeman sings through the hungry vapors 
Rising now like white snakes behind him. 
You told his wife that Lord Buddha made wasps 
From yellow stalks of tobacco with a dark spit. 

Down in the cold bamboo a starving woman 
Has opened a small pig-- 
The old moons climb from its blue glistening stomach, 
Or is it light 
From the infinitely receding sacks of shit? 

Master, where is the difference?





The Perfect Mother
 

1 

The perfect mother lets the cat 
sleep on her head. The 
children laugh. 
Where is she? 
She is not carefully ironing the starched 
ruffles of a Sunday dress. 
What does she say? 
She does not speak. 
Her head is under the cat and 
like the cat, she sleeps. 


       2 

But her children are in a marsh! 
Bogged, they have gone wild. 
Yet, no one should worry. 
See, they are there, in a sunny kitchen. 
They drink cups of soup and wipe 
their faces with yellow napkins. 
What does it matter if 
they are hatching plots, if 
in their waking dreams 
the poor cat is trapped 
its hair 
standing on end? 


       3 

Where shall we go? We ask the perfect 
mother. What 
do you want of us? She is no 
where to be found. 
Not in the cookie jar 
we have broken to bits 
not under the shiny kitchen floor 
not on our lips. 
Here we are transfixed, 
mourning the perfect mother, and she 
is caught in the trapped cat 
of her children's dreams.





The Bad Mother
 

The bad mother wakes from dreams 
of imperfection trying to be perfection. 
All night she's engineered a train 
too heavy with supplies 
to the interior. She fails. 
The child she loves 
has taken on bad habits, cigarettes 
maybe even drugs. She 
recognizes lies. You don't 
fool me, she wants to say, 
the bad mother, ready to play 
and win. 
This lamb who's gone  
this infant she is 
pinioned to  does not listen, 
she drives with all her magic down a 
different route to darkness where 
all life begins.





Great As You Are
 

Be like a bear in the forest of yourself. 
Even sleeping you are powerful in your breath. 
Every hair has life 
and standing, as you do, swaying 
from one foot to the other 
all the forest stands with you. 
Each minute sound, one after another, 
is distinct in your ear. Here 
in the blur of mixed sensations, you can 
feel the crisp outline of being, particulate. 
Great as you are, huge as you are and 
growling like the deepest drum, 
the continual vibration that makes music 
what it is, 
not some light stone skipped on the surface of things, 
you travel below 
sounding the depths where only the dauntless go. 
Be like the bear and 
do not forget 
how you rounded your 
massive shape over the just ripened 
berry which burst 
in your mouth that moment 
how you rolled in 
the wet grass, cool and silvery, mingling 
with your sensate skin, 
how you shut 
your eyes and swam far and farther 
still, starlight 
shaping itself to your body, 
starship rocking the grand, slow waves 
under the white trees, in the 
snowy night.

Autumn
 

I walk outside the stone wall
Looking into the park at night
As armed trees frisk a windfall
Down paths that lampposts light





The Dead of Winter
 

In my coat I sit
At the window sill
Wintering with snow
That did not melt
It fell long ago
At night, by stealth
I was where I am
When the snow began





[He stopped part way across the field to]
 

He stopped part way across the field to 
sit down and rest. An eagle 
descended from the sky and an angel with the face of death 

Before I had a name 
I came out of a place where there wasn't a door 
holding my breath 

in slippery hands. Door to wall 
and back again. The things these were   
The modified currents of air 

at which the dancers are taught to stare 
whenever they turn 
to go but instead fall over 

at the idea of taking an ordinary walk 
for example to the Post Office 
or a restaurant. And all the original atoms 

of water and skin 
we think we can find there 
if we try. This is not Alaska 

and the sun-dial   
is not the sun secretly dying 
during the night





Triptych
 

When my mother                     She who is not               All at once
Was a young girl                     Who she was                  I could see
Before the War                        Waits to be                     My mother
Reading sad books                  Yet she is                        In eternity
By the river                            Already                           I told her
Sometimes, she                      Mother                            She always
Looked up, wisely                   Whose child                      Would be
But did not dream                   Though not yet                The one
The day I would                      Could not be                   Whose son
Be born to her                        An other                         You see





Prose 22
 

Plan of the City of O. The great square 
curves down toward the cathedral. The 
water runs out into night where the patron 
saint still maintains his loft. He enters 
from the lower level and pulls up the ladder 
after him. The woman and children and 
most of the old men spend their time painting 
pictures of the ladder. The rest lay the 
three kinds of stone or type the performance 
for the eastern quarter. There the first 
colony left its box-shaped mark. But   
the sun always goes down in several places, 
so the clocks serve as maps. And at the 
end of the nearest mountain stands the 
larger and less perfect box.





Forever and a Day
 

No more than that
Dead cat shall I
Escape the corpse
I kept in shape
For the day off
Immortals take





Prose 31
 

The Logic of Contradictions
A logical principle is said to be an empty 
or formal proposition because it can add 
nothing to the premises of the argument it 
governs. This leads to the logic of contra- 
dictions. It is an anacoluthon to say that 
a proposition is impossible because it is 
self-contradictory. (It is also ambiguous.) 
The definition of the possible as that which 
in a given state of information (real or 
pretended) we do not know not to be true 
conceals another anacoluthon.





Curriculum Vitae
 

1 

Scribe out of work 
At a loss for words 
Not his to begin with, 
The man life passed by 
Stands at the window 
Biding his time 


       2 

Time and again 
And now once more 
I climb these stairs 
Unlock this door-- 
No name where I live 
Alone in my lair 
With one bone to pick 
And no time to spare





Sonnet: Now I see them
 

Now I see them sitting me before a mirror. 
There's noise and laughter. Somebody 
mentions that hearing is silver 
before we move on to Table One 
with the random numbers. I look down 
a long street containing numbers. 
A white four leans against the fence 
and disappears. In the doorway 
is the seven, then the x 
painted red so you can find it 
more easily. Five goes by 
without its cap. My father wears 
the second x. He has a grey cloud 
for a face, and dark lines for arms.





At a Standstill
 

The statue, that cast 
Of my solitude 
Has found its niche 
In this kitchen 
Where I do not eat 
Where the bathtub stands 
Upon cat feet-- 
I did not advance 
I cannot retreat





Mirror Image
 

Ribs ripple skin
Up to the nipples--
Noah, equipped, knew
Every one has two--
This ark I am in
Embarks my twin





Adam Means Earth*
 

I am the man
Whose name is mud
But what's in a name
To shame one who knows
Mud does not stain
Clay he's made of
Dust Adam became--
The dust he was--
Was he his name





Landscape
 

Boughs berserk
Spin one hill
Into space
Standing still
Olive trees race

On the field below
Moulded white oxen
Ponder each furrow
A man behind them
Cries Via, Via





Ruins
 

Stone worn
Overgrown
Pristine thorns
Sheep shorn
Tinkling below
Roofless walls
Rooks overlook
I told you so 
Babbles the brook





Twilight Blues
 

(Morton St. Pier)
Lying here
Flat on my back
I can almost see
Myself in the morgue
On a slab, tagged

I am the corpse
No one will have
Not stabbed, stored
No one takes my life
It goes by the board





So they stood
 

So they stood
Upon ladders
With pruning hooks
Backs to the king
Who took his leave
Of gardening

This morning 
I am forlorn
As he was then
No one born
After the war
Remembers when





White hair does not weigh
 

more than the black
which it displaces--
Upon any fine day
I jump these traces





A pot poured out
 

A pot poured out
Fulfills its spout





Simon Says
 

In a doorway
Staring at rain
Simple withstands
Time on his hands





Small Kingdom
 

In their doorways women sit sewing
By the good light of afternoon
And nothing is beyond knowing
Though the sun shall go down soon

A shepherdess near a bramble ditch
And the Princess in the Alcazar
Keep the same precise stitch
And they both can see far

And when the knell tolls
All are wondering who--
If it is a lady, many bells
For a beggar, one will do





Salt and Pepper
 

Here and there
White hairs appear
On my chest--
Age seasons me
Gives me zest--
I am a sage
In the making
Sprinkled, shaking





The Living End
 

Before long the end
Of the beginning
Begins to bend
To the beginning
Of the end you live
With some misgivings
About what you did.





The Visitation
 

His body ahead
Of him on the bed
He faces his feet
Sees himself dead,
A corpse complete
With legs and chest
And belly between
Swelling the scene
Of the crime you left,
Taking your time,
Angel of Death





The Niche
 

The niche narrows 
Hones one thin 
Until his bones 
Disclose him





Commemoration
 

Old as I am 
This candle I light 
For you today 
May be the last one 
Of your afterlife 
With me, your son-- 
With me you die twice.





A Farewell
 

Good-bye!--no, do not grieve that it is over, 
   The perfect hour; 
That the winged joy, sweet honey-loving rover, 
   Flits from the flower. 

Grieve not--it is the law. Love will be flying-- 
   Yes, love and all. 
Glad was the living--blessed be the dying. 
   Let the leaves fall.





Awe of Everything
 

Do you know what's the unluckiest thing 
In the world, a differential grasshopper 
Said to me. I paused, I put down the 
Diesel grinder I'd been trying to fix, 
I turned off the stealth bomber, I faded 
Away from the faded away pedals, I put up 
Finely embroidered silk panels over the 
Faces of the statues, I pulled the green 
Vacillating amplifier into the hallway, 
I swiveled seven of the chains and 
Loosened the bolts in the balcony, I went 
Into the barn to unlace the cattle and 
Overturn the empty buckets, I put the 
White flag on the mailbox, I cut the 
Telephone wires, I fed the ducks better 
Than I usually feed them, I adjusted the 
Faucets so they'd drip a little, I waved 
At old Mr. Wiley with his smokeless pipe 
And his manpowered plough across the field, 
I moved a claypot off of a narrow ledge, 
I taped the key to the bulldozer to the 
Roof of the canopy, I took the cup of 
Auger bits away from the rabbit hutch,   
I put a padlock on the children's playhouse, 
I picked up a stick by the sideyard gate, 
I broke it over my knee, I went to the well 
To fill a stone pitcher with cool water,   
I let the donkey & the goats go. I took 
A ladder to the hayloft and took down a   
Suitcase. I could see across the valley 
Down to the river from up there.

Mythistorema
 

1 

The angel -- 
three years we waited for him, attention riveted, 
closely scanning 
the pines the shore the stars. 
One with the blade of the plough or the ship's keel 
we were searching to find once more the first seed 
so that the age-old drama could begin again. 

We returned to our homes broken, 
limbs incapable, mouths cracked 
by the tastes of rust and brine. 
when we woke we traveled towards the north, strangers 
plunged into mist by the immaculate wings of swans that wounded us. 
On winter nights the strong wind from the east maddened us, 
in the summers we were lost in the agony of days that couldn't die. 

We brought back 
these carved reliefs of a humble art. 



             2 

Still one more well inside a cave. 
It used to be easy for us to draw up idols and ornaments 
to please those friends who still remained loyal to us. 

The ropes have broken; only the grooves on the well's lip 
remind us of our past happiness: 
the fingers on the rim, as the poet put it. 
The fingers feel the coolness of the stone a little, 
Then the body's fever prevails over it 
and the cave stakes its soul and loses it 
every moment, full of silence, without a drop of water. 



             3 

                        Remember the baths where you were murdered 

I woke with this marble head in my hands; 
it exhausts my elbow and I don't know where to put it down. 
It was falling into the dream as I was coming out of the dream 
so our life became one and it will be very difficult for it to separate again. 

I look at the eyes: neither open nor closed 
I speak to the mouth which keeps trying to speak 
I hold the cheeks which have broken through the skin. 
That's all I'm able to do. 

My hands disappear and come towards me 
mutilated.

                                                                     Argonauts 

And a soul 
if it is to know itself 
must look 
into its own soul: 
the stranger and enemy, we've seen him in the mirror. 

They were good, the companions, they didn't complain 
about the work or the thirst or the frost, 
they had the bearing of trees and waves 
that accept the wind and the rain 
accept the night and the sun 
without changing in the midst of change. 
They were fine, whole days 
they sweated at the oars with lowered eyes 
breathing in rhythm 
and their blood reddened a submissive skin. 
Sometimes they sang, with lowered eyes 
as we were passing the deserted island with the Barbary figs 
to the west, beyond the cape of the dogs 
that bark. 
If it is to know itself, they said 
it must look into its own soul, they said 
and the oar's struck the sea's gold 
in the sunset. 
We went past many capes many islands the sea 
leading to another sea, gulls and seals. 
Sometimes disconsolate women wept 
lamenting their lost children 
and others frantic sought Alexander the Great 
and glories buried in the depths of Asia. 

We moored on shores full of night-scenes, 
the birds singing, with waters that left on the hands 
the memory of a great happiness. 
But the voyages did not end. 
Their souls became one with the oars and the oarlocks 
with the solemn face of the prow 
with the rudder's wake 
with the water that shattered their image. 
The companions died one by one, 
with lowered eyes. Their oars 
mark the place where they sleep on the shore. 

No one remembers them. Justice 



             5 

We didn't know them 
                                                 deep down it was hope that said 
we'd known them since early childhood. 
We saw them perhaps twice and then they took to the ships: 
cargoes of coal, cargoes of grain, and our friends 
lost beyond the ocean forever. 
Dawn finds us beside the tired lamp 
drawing on paper, awkwardly, painfully, 
ships mermaids or sea shells; 
at dusk we go down to the river 
because it shows us the way to the sea; 
and we spend the nights in cellars that smell of tar. 

Our friends have left us 
                                                      perhaps we never saw them, perhaps 
we met them when sleep 
still brought us close to the breathing wave 
perhaps we search for them because we search for the other life, 
beyond the statues.

The garden with its fountains in the rain 
you will see only from behind the clouded glass 
of the low window. Your room 
will be lit only by the flames from the fireplace 
and sometimes the distant lightning will reveal 
the wrinkles on your forehead, my old Friend. 

The garden with the fountains that in your hands 
was a rhythm of the other life, beyond the broken 
statues and the tragic columns 
and a dance among the oleanders 
near the new quarries -- 
misty glass will have cut it off from your life. 
You won't breathe; earth and the sap of the trees 
will spring from your memory to strike 
this window struck by rain 
from the outside world.

                                                             South wind 

Westward the sea merges with a mountain range. 
From our left the south wind blows and drives us mad, 
the kind of wind that strips bones of their flesh. 
Our house among pines and carobs. 
Large windows. Large tables 
for writing you the letters we've been writing 
so many months now, dropping them 
into the space between us in order to fill it up. 

Star of dawn, when you lowered your eyes 
our hours were sweeter than oil 
on a wound, more joyful than cold water 
to the palate, more peaceful than a swan's wings. 
You held our life in the palm of your hand. 
After the bitter bread of exile, 
at night if we remain in front of the white wall 
your voice approaches us like the hope of fire; 
and again this wind hones 
a razor against our nerves. 

Each of us writes you the same thing 
and each falls silent in the other's presence, 
watching, each of us, the same world separately 
the light and darkness on the mountain range 
and you. 
Who will lift this sorrow from our hearts? 
Yesterday evening a heavy rain and again today 
the covered sky burdens us. Our thoughts  
like the pine needles of yesterday's downpour 
bunched up and useless in front of our doorway -- 
would build a collapsing tower. 

Among these decimated villages 
on this promontory, open to the south wind 
with the mountain range in front of us hiding you, 
who will appraise for us the sentence to oblivion? 
Who will accept our offering, at this close of autumn? 



             8 

What are they after, our souls, travelling 
on the decks of decayed ships 
crowded in with sallow women and crying babies 
unable to forget themselves either with the flying fish 
or with the stars that the masts point our at their tips; 
grated by gramophone records 
committed to non-existent pilgrimages unwillingly 
murmuring broken thoughts from foreign languages. 

What are they after, our souls, travelling 
on rotten brine-soaked timbers 
from harbour to harbour? 

Shifting broken stones, breathing in 
the pine's coolness with greater difficulty each day, 
swimming in the waters of this sea 
and of that sea, 
without the sense of touch 
without men 
in a country that is no longer ours 
nor yours. 

We knew that the islands were beautiful 
somewhere round about here where we grope, 
slightly lower down or slightly higher up, 
a tiny space. 



             9 

The harbour is old, I can't wait any longer 
for the friend who left the island with the pine trees 
for the friend who left the island with the plane trees 
for the friend who left for the open sea. 
I stroke the rusted cannons, I stroke the oars 
so that my body may revive and decide. 
The sails give off only the smell 
of salt from the other storm. 

If I chose to remain alone, what I longed for 
was solitude, not this kind of waiting, 
my soul shattered on the horizon, 
these lines, these colours, this silence. 

The night's stars take me back to Odysseus, 
to his anticipation of the dead among the asphodels. 
When we moored here we hoped to find among the asphodels 
the gorge that knew the wounded Adonis. 



             10 

Our country is closed in, all mountains 
that day and night have the low sky as their roof. 
We have no rivers, we have no wells, we have no springs, 
only a few cisterns -- and these empty -- that echo, and that we worship. 
A stagnant hollow sound, the same as our loneliness 
the same as our love, the same as our bodies. 
We find it strange that once we were able to build 
our houses, huts and sheep-folds. 
And our marriages, the cool coronals and the fingers, 
become enigmas inexplicable to our soul. 
How were our children born, how did they grow strong? 

Our country is closed in. The two black Symplegades 
close it in. When we go down 
to the harbours on Sunday to breathe freely 
we see, lit in the sunset, 
the broken planks from voyages that never ended, 
bodies that no longer know how to love. 



             11 

Sometimes your blood froze like the moon 
in the limitless night your blood 
spread its white wings over 
the black rocks, the shapes of trees and houses, 
with a little light from our childhood years. 



             12 

                                                                         Bottle in the sea 

Three rocks, a few burnt pines, a lone chapel 
and farther above 
the same landscape repeated starts again: 
three rocks in the shape of a gateway, rusted, 
a few burnt pines, black and yellow, 
and a square hut buried in whitewash; 
and still farther above, many times over, 
the same landscape recurs level after level 
to the horizon, to the twilit sky. 

Here we moored the ship to splice the broken oars, 
to drink water and to sleep. 
The sea that embittered us is deep and unexplored 
and unfolds a boundless calm. 
Here among the pebbles we found a coin 
and threw dice for it. 
The youngest won it and disappeared. 

We put to sea again with our broken oars. 



             13 

                                                                         Hydra 

Dolphins banners and the sound of cannons. 
The sea once so bitter to your soul 
bore the many-coloured and glittering ships 
it swayed, rolled and tossed them, all blue with white wings, 
once so bitter to your soul 
now full of colours in the sun. 

White sails and sunlight and wet oars 
struck with a rhythm of drums on stilled waves. 

Your eyes, watching, would be beautiful, 
your arms, reaching out, would glow, 
your lips would come alive, as they used to, 
at such a miracle: 
that's what you were looking for 
                                           what were you looking for in front of ashes 
or in the rain in the fog in the wind 
even when the lights were growing dim 
and the city was sinking and on the stone pavement 
the Nazarene showed you his heart, 
what were you looking for? why don't you come? what were you looking for? 



             14 

Three red pigeons in the light 
inscribing our fate in the light 
with colours and gestures of people 
we once loved. 



             15 

                                                             Quid  opacissimus 

Sleep wrapped you in green leaves like a tree 
you breathed like a tree in the quiet light 
in the limpid spring I looked at your face: 
eyelids closed, eyelashes brushing the water. 
In the soft grass my fingers found your fingers 
I held your pulse a moment 
and felt elsewhere your heart's pain. 

Under the plane tree, near the water, among laurel 
sleep moved you and scattered you 
around me, near me, without my being able to touch the whole of you -- 
one as you were with your silence; 
seeing your shadow grow and diminish, 
lose itself in the other shadows, in the other 
world that let you go yet held you back. 

The life that they gave us to live, we lived. 
Pity those who wait with such patience 
lost in the black laurel under the heavy plane trees 
and those, alone, who speak to cisterns and wells 
and drown in the voice's circles. 
Pity the companion who shared our privation and our sweat 
and plunged into the sun like a crow beyond the ruins, 
without hope of enjoying our reward. 

Give us, outside sleep, serenity.

                                                                         The name is Orestes 

On the track, once more on the track, on the track, 
how many times around, how many blood-stained laps, how many black 
rows; the people who watch me, 
who watched me when, in the chariot, 
I raised my hand glorious, and they roared triumphantly. 

The froth of the horses strikes me, when will the horses tire? 
The axle creaks, the axle burns, when will the axle burst into flame? 
When will the reins break, when will the hooves 
tread flush on the ground 
on the soft grass, among the poppies 
where, in the spring, you picked a daisy. 
They were lovely, your eyes, but you didn't know where to look 
nor did I know where to look, I, without a country, 
I who go on struggling here, how many times around? 
and I feel my knees give way over the axle 
over the wheels, over the wild track 
knees buckle easily when the gods so will it, 
no one can escape, what use is strength, you can't 
escape the sea that cradled you and that you search for 
at this time of trial, with the horses panting, 
with the reeds that used to sing in autumn to the Lydian mode 
the sea you cannot find no matter how you run 
no matter how you circle past the black, bored Eumenides,   
unforgiven. 



             17 
                                                                                                            
                                                                               Astyanax 

Now that you are leaving, take the boy with you as well, 
the boy who saw the light under the plane tree, 
one day when trumpets resounded and weapons shone 
and the sweating horses 
bent to the trough to touch with wet nostrils 
the green surface of the water. 

The olive trees with the wrinkles of our fathers 
the rocks with the wisdom of our fathers 
and our brother's blood alive on the earth 
were a vital joy, a rich pattern 
for the souls who knew their prayer. 

Now that you are leaving, now that the day of payment 
dawns, now that no one knows 
whom he will kill and how he will die, 
take with you the boy who saw the light 
under the leaves of that plane tree 
and teach him to study the trees. 



             18 

I regret having let a broad river slip through my fingers 
without drinking a single drop. 
Now I'm sinking into the stone. 
A small pine tree in the red soil 
is all the company I have. 
Whatever I loved vanished with the houses 
that were new last summer 
and crumbled in the winds of autumn. 



             19 

Even if the wind blows it doesn't cool us 
and the shade is meagre under the cypress trees 
and all around slopes ascending to the mountains; 

they're a burden for us 
the friends who no longer know how to die. 



             20 

In my breast the wound opens again 
when the stars descend and become kin to my body 
when silence falls under the footsteps of men. 

These stones sinking into time, how far will they drag me with them? 
The sea, the sea, who will be able to drain it dry? 
I see the hands beckon each drawn to the vulture and the hawk 
bound as I am to the rock that suffering has made mine, 
I see the trees breathing the black serenity of the dead 
and then the smiles, so static, of the statues. 



             21 

We who set out on this pilgrimage 
looked at the broken statues 
became distracted and said that life is not so easily lost 
that death has unexplored paths 
and its own particular justice; 

that while we, still upright on our feet, are dying, 
affiliated in stone 
united in hardness and weakness, 
the ancient dead have escaped the circle and risen again 
and smile in a strange silence. 



             22 

So very much having passed before our eyes 
that even our eyes saw nothing, but beyond 
and behind was memory like the white sheet one night in an enclosure 
where we saw strange visions, even stranger than you, 
pass by and vanish into the motionless foliage of a pepper tree; 

having known this fate of ours so well 
wandering among broken stones, three or six thousand years 
searching in collapsed buildings that might have been our homes 
trying to remember dates and heroic deeds: 
will we be able? 

having been bound and scattered, 
having struggled, as they said, with non-existent difficulties 
lost, then finding again a road full of blind regiments 
sinking in marshes and in the lake of Marathon, 
will we be able to die as we should? 



             23 

A little farther 
we will see the almond trees blossoming 
the marble gleaming in the sun 
the sea breaking into waves 

a little farther, 
let us rise a little higher. 



             24 

Here end the works of the sea, the works of love. 
Those who will some day live here where we end -- 
should the blood happen to darken in their memory and overflow -- 
let them not forget us, the weak souls among the asphodels, 
let them turn the heads of the victims towards Erebus: 

We who had nothing will school them in serenity.





Three Trees
 

The aqua green goes with the pink 
in a way no one knows what will happen. 
Every step is a dangerous taking. 
Amazing the time span of a trunk 
(a door opens in it and suddenly, 
someone is asking how this came to be). 
The green curtain is a pressed chime 
which when rung rings in a dogwood 
white as if a storm were approaching 
its green extreme. 

Brick crumbles into living pond particle 
while a bent hook holds back 
the last dissolve. 
An uneasy leap over a sharky sea. 
Gravity plays its little emotive role. 
It's Elm Street all over 
again, ragged walkways lead to Toon Town. 
Hello kids. Hello Jimmy Neutron. 
The blanket rises, and under it, 
a fetishistic pompadour 

green, greener and paler than bluebird. 
But hush, the nuclear power plant 
is about to blow unless 
Jimmy can locate the elusive button. 
A siren and standing-by fire truck. 
It looks like a lost cause until presto, 
a messenger. A racketing aside. 
The day is dragged here and there but still 
can't be saved. BAM. Immediately 
the next second clicks into the skyscape 
apocalypse. In the dust, a celluloid woman 
mows a multilayered lawn. 
The arch overhead reads, O Art 
Still Has Truth Take Refuge. Where? There. 
There, there, says someone.





The Role of Elegy
 

The role of elegy is 
To put a death mask on tragedy, 
A drape on the mirror. 
To bow to the cultural 

Debate over the aesthetization of sorrow, 
Of loss, of the unbearable 
Afterimage of the once material. 
To look for an imagined 

Consolidation of grief 
So we can all be finished 
Once and for all and genuinely shut up 
The cabinet of genuine particulars. 

Instead there's the endless refrain 
One hears replayed repeatedly 
Through the just ajar door: 
Some terrible mistake has been made. 

What is elegy but the attempt 
To rebreathe life 
Into what the gone one once was 
Before he grew to enormity. 

Come on stage and be yourself, 
The elegist says to the dead. Show them 
Now--after the fact-- 
What you were meant to be: 

The performer of a live song. 
A shoe. Now bow. 
What is left but this: 
The compulsion to tell. 

The transient distraction of ink on cloth 
One scrubbed and scrubbed 
But couldn't make less. 
Not them, not soon. 

Each day, a new caption on the cartoon 
Ending that simply cannot be. 
One hears repeatedly, the role of elegy is.





Definitely
 

What is desire 
But the hardwire argument given 
To the mind's unstoppable mouth. 

Inside the braincase, it's I 
Want that fills every blank. And then the hand 
Reaches for the pleasure 

The plastic snake offers. Someone says, Yes, 
It will all be fine in some future soon. 
Definitely. I've conjured a body 

In the chair before me. Be yourself, I tell it. 
Here memory makes you 
Unchangeable: that shirt, those summer pants. 

That beautiful face. 
That tragic beautiful mind. 
That mind's ravenous mouth 

That told you, This isn't poison 
At all but just what the machine needs. And then, 
The mouth closes on its hunger. 

The heart stops.





How Beautiful
 

A personal lens: glass bending rays 
That gave one that day's news 
Saying each and every day, 

Just remember you are standing 
On a planet that's evolving. 
How beautiful, she thought, what distance does 

For water, the view from above or afar. 
In last night's dream, they were back again 
At the beginning. She was a child 

And he was a child. 
A plane lit down and left her there. 
Cold whitening the white sky whiter. 

Then a scalpel cut her open for all the world 
To be a sea.





Concord Hymn
 

Your joke

Is like a lake

That lies there without any thought

And sees

Dead seas

The birds fly

Around there

Bewildered by its blue without any thought of water

Without any thought

Of water.





The Paradox of Jeromes Lion
 

Local his discourse, not yet exemplary, 
Nowadays he is old, the translator, 
So old he is practically transparent. 

Good things and otherwise, evils done 
Come home to him, too close to the bone 
And so little transformed, 
Him so transparent, 
They float in and out of his window. 

Killing fields and the pumpkin patch, 
The combat boot putrid in a cherry tree, 
Stroke on stroke the mortal build-up, 
All the constraint, all the letting go, 

So insistent in his attentions 
That he needs a breathing block. 
For lack of a monitor he might levitate, 
The testy old bird, at his wondow; 
He needs an animal, a sure thing, 
One to imagine, at last. Speechless 
As bedrock, a rough reminder of that. 

A dog might be vigilant enough, 
Intact, all heart, a yellow desert dog. 
Avoirdupoids. A leopard? Markings 
Regular, talons to swat 
Any hurt away. Knowing 
Hunger, not the greed. Sufficient 

Unto itself, svelte, clean of limb; 
Free through self-discipline, yes, 
Yes, through self-discipline free, 

And fierce, yet doing no violence 
The wild by right he will restore 
To a holy place, in time. 

For want of that sort of a beast, 
He might make do with a frog.





The Diving Apprentices
 

Sometimes you watch them going out to sea 
On such a day as this, in the worst of weathers, 
Their boat holding ten or a dozen of them, 
In black rubber suits crouched around the engine housing, 
Tanks of air, straps and hoses, and for their feet 
Enormous flippers. 

                                 The bow, with such a load on board, 
Hammers through the whitecaps, while they talk; 
Junonian girls, Praxitelean boys, pelted on 
By bursting clouds, by spray, eventually heave 
The tanks upon their backs, the boat drifts at anchor, 

And down they go to the sea floor, by the foggy headland. 
At least, you can presume they kick the flippers 
And plunge to where the water is more calm. The cool 
Instructors must keep eyes and ears 
Open. Accidents out there, they happen. 

                                        You might imagine scraps 
Of cultural dbris, a broken pot, a ring, a cogwheel 
Come up, clutched in a palm, and interesting, 
A wave pattern in it, the blade of a sword, 
When a lucky diver breaks again the surface. Time, 
Time and again frigate and schooner cracked 
Blown against the rocks, holed below the water line. 

                                        Even an inscription 
Might now be coming up from those green deeps. 
Yet the divers do their silent thing. On the sea floor 
Expect only the sea, a multitude of sand without an hourglass. 
Round somebody's ankle idly it swarms. A diver 
Hangs by a thread of breath in solitude there. Some go down 
In all simplicity curious; to have tales to tell; 
And who knows, what they learn 
Just might, long after this, be usable.





Charles Meryon
 

1 
Meryon saw it coming (who was he?): 
No people, so no noise. As it should be. 
The Bridge. The Morgue. Ghostly round his bed 
Antipodean atolls and tattoos had fluted, 

Volcanoes puffed. Then borborygmic sea 
Forked, at its last gasp, into a V: 
Down that black gallery and backward slid 
A syrup, foul, ovum and sperm concocted, 
The foggy groan of Antichrist. 1863: 
People mattered nothing, live or dead. 

Paris by his impeccable etchings emptied: 
Pointy turrets, windows, not a single head 
Poking out--and there across the sky, 
Tortuous, the skeleton birds creak by. 

2 
As if all the steps had stopped 
As if all the takes had token 
As if all the creaks had croaken 
As if all that weeps had wopped 

As if all that flips had flopped 
As if all that mocks had moaken 
As if all that speaks had spoken 
As if all that drips had dropped 

As if all that hopes had hopped 
As if all that leaps had lopped 
As if all that aches had oaken 
As if all that peaks had poken 
As if all that creeps had cropped 
As if all that peeps had popped

The old aquaforte art is back, thought Baudelaire. 
Multiple majesty of stone piled on stone; 
Obelisks of industry discharge into the air 
Their coalescent smoke. Almost airborne 
Scaffoldings roped to monuments under repair-- 
Very poetic, beauty so paradoxical 
I never saw the like; 

                        and the sky over it all-- 
Eagles. Tumult. Perspective deepens there 
With all the dramas that have come and gone. 

The artist: Once a sailor, now he'll seek 
In nooks of masonry a sphinx. 

                            I think you'd get a scare 
To hear him talk: "Poe did not exist, aha! 
Poe was a syndicate! 

                            To Madame Aupick: 
Au fait tu as peut-tre oubli tous a.

How should people promenade on maps? 
My map--I image what goes up, like steeple... 
On map there is no space, no time, for people... 
With window slot I thicken this faade, perhaps? 

I map the time. These arches, tenements-- 
Voice the design of fate, exact. Why folks? 
They are confusion. Burin cannot coax 
Their hollow little solids to make sense. 

The earth, a globe. On it Paree, immense 
Phantom, or ulcer. So I map excrescence. 
I probe its twisted fibres till I find 
The core of its cabala, in my mind. 

Ah, you are being faraway too kind. 
Dark, beautiful cabala! 
                              Goodbye, gentlemens.





Nietzsches Hands
 

Celebrated, the moustache, 
And near enough ignored 
His "beautiful hands. 

Capable on a keyboard, improvised 
A polonaise, his own artistic 
Compositions "dull and decent. 

He could see, some, but much swam, out there: 
Knives and forks, print, street signs. 
Then, his mind made up, he laid about, 

Sank immense nets into the cultural acid. 
When we winched them back in, on fingertips, 
They rippled with rainbows--herring and sprat 

He could fling, raw, in the teeth 
Of the Brgertum, God rot it. Ah, no God: 
So to invoke the impact of quanta on quanta 

And extirpate for keeps the German cabbage, 
His fingers, subject to whim, and rounded 
Like objects in a metephor, made good the feeble 

Peering eyes. Each tip housed a labyrinth, 
Circling in or out, from ivories an octopod 
Pressed the torrent of a tune. From Cretan pots 

Their gestures, snaking out, apprehended, 
Turn on turn, a tumbril in the stars. 
Those fingers must have held, no less, the comb 

To bush his hairy icon out, to primp. 
On long mountain walks they jotted Gothic 
Letters on a page, deleted angrily 

Brainwaves, on a page one trouser leg 
Segregated from his knee. What a joy, 
At long last, to know the knower not deceived 

But disobedient, at his word. Underneath 
The creams of language here's a tongue can taste 
A universe, cyclopic, but propulsive, alien 

To a species blocked by self-torment, 
To shopping, authority--all the cockahoop 
Engines of flesh not fuelled by despair. 

When Nietzche, squinting, trimmed his fingernails, 
Did he care for suchlike slighter things? 
To a turning pot a potter's fingers do not cling.





January 1919
 

What if I know, Liebknecht, who shot you dead. 
Tiegarten trees unroll 
staggering shadow, in spite of it all. 
I am among the leaves; the inevitable 
voices 
have nothing left to say, the holed head 
bleeding across a heap of progressive magazines; 
torn from your face, 
trees that turned around, 
we do not sanctify the land with our wandering. 
Look upon our children, they are mutilated.





Feuilleton 5: The Buskers
 

Four buskers almost balkanized, tonight, 
August 4th, the Place de la Contrescarpe. 

Every one of them in wind and limb complete, 
The accordionist all but a hunchback-- 

After the first melodious flourishes were done, 
The clarinet began to take his instrument apart, 

Blowing shorter tunes, to show the way it worked; 
But on a keyboard hanging from his neck 

The carpenter pianist banged out routine chords 
And the violin a beanpole man was fingering 

Sliced through the edges of catalpa leaves 
With long shrieks, rat trills, and all in fun. 

Cars now orbiting the quadrangle of trees 
Turned into tubes filled with human meat, 

Notes took the scent of carnage from their lager 
(Even so, the buzz of talk, no way to stop it) 

And cherry red the track suit of its rider, 

The sliced leaves, iron chains that link 
Old mooring posts around the beds of flowers. 

Fogged the eye with fright, and meaning trouble 
Identical white camper caravans 


Rolled into view, the one behind the other, 
For things to jump from, us to be flung into. 

Rohmahniyah! he shouts, shaking his money pot, 
The clarinettist, Ceausescu, fini! Whereupon, 

Classic features, stepping light and fresh 
From reeds that told secrets of a beauty parlour. 

A nice Missouri girl, in gree, with pearls 
To plug each earlobe, pushed her wicker chair aside; 

Showing a dainty midriff, on steady legs 
She strolled across the street, as if to depollute 

With every breath, every stride, the air 
Our music for a moment had iunhabited. 

Then the white, lost caravans came back again, 
Carnation milk inside, stringbags of potatoes, 

Family snug inside, in each a Belgian grandpa, 
Peering every which way, at the wheel.





Elegy a Little
 

Linoleum and half a dozen eggs 
In 1960 
            Many towered Ilium 
A brand name and a shopping list too 

Memory distinguishes all things from 
Only nothing 
                   I was born and grew 
Rooms stacked up into houses 
A few trees (maples) welted in their seasons 
Wildly like sea birds in crude oil 
                                              What amazes 
Me now amazed me always but never 
Often eyesight is prophetic instantly 

Seeing broken eggs on the linoleum 
In the kitchen 1960 
I saw a broken lifetime further 
On as I see now my happy sister





Deola Thinking
 

Deola passes her mornings sitting in a cafe, 
and nobody looks at her. Everyone's rushing to work, 
under a sun still fresh with the dawn. Even Deola 
isn't looking for anyone: she smokes serenely, breathing 
the morning. In years past, she slept at this hour 
to recover her strength: the throw on her bed 
was black with the boot-prints of soldiers and workers, 
the backbreaking clients. But now, on her own, 
it's different: the work's more refined, and it's easier. 
Like the gentleman yesterday, who woke her up early, 
kissed her, and took her (I'd stay awhile, dear, 
in Turin with you, if I could) to the station 
to tell him goodbye. 
                              She's dazed this morning, but fresh-- 
Deola likes being free, likes drinking her milk 
and eating brioches. This morning she's nearly a lady, 
and if she looks at anyone now, it's just to pass the time. 
The girls at the house are still sleeping. The air stinks, 
the madam goes out for a walk, it's crazy to stay there. 
To work the bars in the evening you have to look good; 
at that house, by thirty, you've lost what little looks you had left. 

Deola sits with her profile turned toward a mirror 
and looks at herself in the cool of the glass: her face pale, 
and not from the smoke; her brow a bit furrowed. 
To survive at that house, you'd need a will 
like Mar used to have (because, honey, these men 
come here to get something they can't get at home 
from their wives or their lovers) and Mar used to work 
tirelessly, full of good cheer and blessed with good health. 
The people who pass the cafe aren't distracting Deola-- 
she only works evenings, making slow conquests 
to music, in her usual bar. She'll make eyes. 
at a client, or nudge his foot, while enjoying the band 
that makes her seem like an actress doing a love scene 
with a young millionaire. One client each evening 
is enough to scrape by on. (Maybe that gentleman from last night 
really will take me with him.) To be alone, if she wants, 
in the morning. To sit in a caf. To not look for anyone.





Atlantic Oil
 

The drunk mechanic is happy to be in the ditch. 
From the tavern, five minutes through the dark field 
and you're home. But first, there's the cool grass 
to enjoy, and the mechanic will sleep here till dawn. 
A few feet away, the red and black sign that rises 
from the field: if you're too close, you can't read it, 
it's that big. At this hour, it's still wet dew. 
Later, the streets will cover it with dust, as it covers 
the bushes. The mechanic, beneath it, stretches in sleep. 

Silence is total. Shortly, in the warmth of the sun, 
one car after another will pass, waking the dust. 
At the top of the hill they slow down for the curve, 
then plunge down the slope. A few of the cars 
stop at the garage, in the dust, to drink a few liters. 
At this time of the morning, the mechanics, still dazed, 
will be sitting on oil drums, waiting for work. 
It's a pleasure to spend the morning sitting in the shade, 
where the stink of oil's cut with the smell of green, 
of tobacco, of wine, and where work comes to them, 
right to the door. Sometimes it's even amusing: 
peasants' wives come to scold them, blaming the garage 
for the traffic--it frightens the animals and women-- 
and for making their husbands look sullen: quick trips 
down the hill into Turin that lighten their wallets. 
Between laughing and selling gas, one of them will pause: 
these fields, it's plain to see, are covered with road dust, 
if you try to sit on the grass, it'll drive you away. 
On the hillside, there's a vineyard he prefers to all others, 
and in the end he'll marry that vineyard and the sweet girl 
who comes with it, and he'll go out in the sun to work, 
but now with a hoe, and his neck will turn brown, 
and he'll drink wine pressed on fall evenings from his own grapes. 

Cars pass during the night, too, but more quietly, 
so quiet the drunk in the ditch hasn't woken. At night 
they don't raise much dust, and the beams of their headlights, 
as they round the curve, reveal in full the sign in the field. 
Near dawn, they glide cautiously along, you can't hear a thing 
except maybe the breeze, and from the top of the hill 
they disappear into the plain, sinking in shadows.





Affairs
 

Dawn on the black hill, and up on the roof 
cats drowsing. Last night, there was a boy 
who fell off this roof, breaking his back. 
The wind riffles the cool leaves of the trees. 
The red clouds above are warm and move slowly. 
A stray dog appears in the alley below, sniffing 
the boy on the cobblestones, and a raw wail 
rises up among chimneys: someone's unhappy. 

The crickets were singing all night, and the stars 
were blown out by the wind. In dawn's glow, 
even the eyes of the cats in love were extinguished, 
the cats the boy watched. The female is crying, 
no toms are around and nothing can soothe her: 
not the tops of the trees, not the red clouds. 
She cries to the wide sky, as if it were still night. 

The boy was spying on cats making love. 
The stray dog sniffs the boy's body and growls; 
he got here at dawn, fleeing the glow 
that crept down the far hill. Swimming the river 
that drenched him as dew drenches fields, 
he was finally caught by the light. The bitches 
were still howling. 
                           The river runs smoothly, 
skimmed by birds that drop from red clouds, 
elated to find their river deserted.





The Country Whore
 

The big front wall that blocks off the courtyard 
often catches the newborn light of the sun 
like the side of a barn. The body awakes 
in the morning to a room, messy and empty, 
that smells of the first, clumsy perfume. 
Even that body, wrapped now in sheets, 
is the same that it was when it thrilled in discovery. 

Her body wakes alone to the extended call 
of morning, the languor of another morning 
returning in the heavy shadows: the barn 
of childhood and the heavy tiredness of sun 
hot in the indolent doorways. A perfume 
worked itself into the usual sweat 
of her hair, a smell the animals knew. 
Her body took secret pleasure in the sun's 
suggestive, serene caress--like a real touch. 

The languor of bed saps the sprawled limbs, 
still youthful and plump, like a child's. 
The clumsy child used to smell the mixed scent 
of tobacco and hay, used to tremble when touched 
by the man's quick hands: she liked playing games. 
Sometimes she played lying down with the man 
in the hay, but he wasn't smelling her hair: 
he'd find her closed legs in the hay and pry 
them open, then crush her like he was her father. 
The perfume was flowers ground upon stones. 

It often returns, in the slow rise from sleep, 
that undone aroma of far-off flowers, 
of barns and of sun. No man can know 
the subtle caress of that sour memory. 
No man can see, beyond that sprawled body, 
that childhood passed in such clumsy anxiety.





Words from Confinement
 

We would go down to the fish market early 
to cleanse our vision: the fish were silver, 
and scarlet, and green, and the color of sea. 
The fish were lovlier than even the sea 
with its silvery scales. We thought of return. 

Lovely too the women with jars on their heads, 
olive-brown clay, shaped softly like thighs: 
we each thought of our women, their voices, 
their laughs, the way they walked down the street. 
And each of us laughed. And it rained on the sea. 

In vineyards that cling to cracks in the earth, 
water softens the leaves and the grape-stems. The sky 
is colored by occasional clouds that redden 
with pleasure and sun. On earth, flavors and smells; 
in the sky, color. And we were alone there. 

We thought of return the way a man thinks 
of morning after an utterly sleepless night. 
We took pleasure in the color of fish and the glisten 
of fruit, all so alive in the musk of the sea. 
We were drunk on the thought of impending return.





"And then we cowards
 

And then we cowards 
who loved the whispering 
evening, the houses, 
the paths by the river, 
the dirty red lights 
of those places, the sweet 
soundless sorrow-- 
we reached our hands out 
toward the living chain 
in silence, but our heart 
startled us with blood, 
and no more sweetness then, 
no more losing ourselves 
on the path by the river-- 
no longer slaves, we knew 
we were alone and alive.





Cancer and Complaint at Midsummer
 

Because the silence of the dead, 
that blue expanse of sky about 
to ashen here above my head, 
is easily ignored, our tears 
are blamed on flowers whitening limbs 
of trees, the very air, with hymns 
of summer pollen no one hears 
except for women--old, devout. 

And now, these humid months, dispute 
them not: midsummer has no name 
among the dead, no Latin root 
to which it can be traced, no swarm 
of conjugations to decipher. 
So little left to write this summer, 
my mind now weak in handling form, 
which I still cling to just the same.





Devon House
 

Kingston, Jamaica
Lamps have begun to light as evening,   
alluvial, fills every crevice in the courtyard,   

fills Devon House, alone with its marble columns, 
its verandas and esplanades empty, 

the plantation gone, and the fields,   
the courtyard a tourist attraction now:   

glass ashtrays etched with boys 
too large to be clambering coconut trees, 

statuettes of women too smooth to be burdened   
with baskets of fruit on their heads, stoneware 

with doctor birds captured in the shallowest bas-relief, 
key rings carved in the rough shape of the island; 

and now even the hummingbirds are spoken of as jewels 
where once everyone drowned in leaf-filtered sunlight.





Ode to a Yellow Onion
 

And what if I had simply passed you by, 
your false skins gathering light in a basket,   
those skins of unpolished copper, 
would you have lived more greatly? 

Now you are free of that metallic coating, 
a broken hull of parchment, 
the dried petals of a lily-- 
those who have not loved you 
will not know differently. 

But you are green fading into yellow-- 
how deceptive you have been. 

Once I played the cithara, 
fingers chafing against each note. 
Once I worked the loom, 
cast the shuttle through the warp. 
Once I scrubbed the tiles 
deep in the tub of Alejandro. 
Now I try to deciper you. 

Beyond the village, within a cloud 
of wild cacao and tamarind, 
they chant your tale, how you, 
most common of your kind, 
make the great warrior-men cry 
but a woman can unravel you.





Port Royal
 

Jamaica, 1960
Ignoring the local reliquiae-- 
neoclassical arches in ruin, 
courtyards, their fountains toppled, 

prados flourishing in prickle-weed, esplanades 
no longer level enough to collect rainwater, 
much less respect for the Imperio de Espaa  

tarnished by an islander's mock-British accent-- 
two fisherman returned at sundown. 
Antiquaries themselves, these fishermen 

schooled in the currents, the tide, 
the tunneled limestone of the coral reefs, 
preferred the graceful curves of the . 

At the landing, five children, single file, 
marched away the birds like soldiers, 
the learned lyrics escaping their lips: 

Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves.





At the Moment
 

Suddenly, I stopped thinking about Love, 
after so many years of only that, 
after thinking that nothing else mattered. 

And what was I thinking of when I stopped 
thinking about Love? Death, of course--what else 
could take Love's place? What else could hold such force? 

I thought about how far away Death once 
had seemed, how unexpected that it could 
happen to someone I knew quite well, 

how impossible that this should be the 
normal thing, as natural as frost and 
winter. I thought about the way we'd aged, 

how skin fell into wrinkles, how eyes grew 
dim; then (of course) my love, I thought of you.





Casino
 

My mind is shuffling its deck tonight,   
slipping one card over another,   
letting them all fall together at the corners;   
the random hand of memory 
is dealing from the bottom of the pack. 

First: a bearded man emptying 
the dragon kiln, then a woman 
whistling, her face turned away   
as she opens the oven. Next:   
a big cat, six toes on each paw,   
climbing up the yardpole. Last:   
a pair of workhorses circling a tree 
until they grind themselves to dust. 

There is no one home in the world 
tonight. Everyone is out of range. 
The cradles are empty, the boughs 
broken down. Trees go helter-skelter 
and the wheel is creaking on its shaft. 
Hit me, I say to the dealer. Hit me again.





A Kind of Villanelle
 

I will have been walking away: 
no matter what direction I intended, 
at that moment, I will have been walking 

Away into the direction that you now say 
I have always intended, no matter what my 
intention was then, I will have been 

Walking away, though it will not be clear 
what it was that I was leaving or 
even why, it seems that you will say 

That always, I was walking away, 
intending a direction that was not towards 
you, but moving away with every step, 

Or, even when I pretended to be walking 
towards you, only making the place 
for my feet to go backwards, 

Away, where I will have been walking, 
always away:   intention and direction 
unknown, but knowing you will always 
say I will have been walking away.





The Exorcism
 

It was homemade and primitive,   
like pulling a tooth with a string 
and a slamming door, like taking out 
an appendix by kerosene light 
where dogs wandered in and out 
the dirt-floored room. 
Nothing for the pain that 
everyone wanted to examine,   
the twisted heart they thought 
they could shout back into place. 

Moaning and fluttering their fleshy hands 
on the wind, on the wail of the soul possessed,   
they certified her in a manner Inquisitional,   
frantic when she held to the grip of darkness,   
grimly determined to wait the thing out,   
something learned from movie sheriffs,   
white hats ghostly in the moonlight. 

When she would not answer (though they 
conjured her by heaven and by the all 
mighty names they knew), they laid hands 
on her and shouted down the well of her eyes. 
Many tongues twisted in their mouths when 
she went, leaving behind only   
the smallest tooth of wickedness.





Older, Younger, Both
 

I feel older, younger, both 
at once. Every time I win, 
I lose. Every time I count, 
I forget and must begin again. 

I must begin again, and again I 
must begin. Every time I lose, 
I win and must begin again. 

Everything I plan must wait, and 
having to wait has made me old, and 
the older I get, the more I wait, and everything 
I'm waiting for has already been planned. 

I feel sadder, wiser, neither 
together. Everything is almost 
true, and almost true is everywhere. 
I feel sadder, wiser, neither at once. 

I end in beginning, in ending I find 
that beginning is the first thing to do. 
I stop when I start, but my heart keeps on beating, 
so I must go on starting in spite of the stopping. 

I must stop my stopping and start to start-- 
I can end at the beginning or begin at the end. 
I feel older, younger, both at once.





Charles Graner Is Not America
 

Let's get this straight: Charles Graner   
is not America. America would never   
hold a knife to his wife's throat, then say 
when she woke that he was considering 
killing her. And America's wife in turn 
would never call her husband "my own 
Hannibal Lecter. Am I right, or what?   
Charles Graner may be Hannibal Lecter,   
but he is not America. America is not that   
kind of husband. Nor would America email 
his adolescent children photos of himself 
torturing naked Iraqi prisoners and say 
"look what Daddy gets to do! Am I right? 
America is not that kind of father. America   
would never torture naked Iraqi prisoners.   
Let's be absolutely clear about all of this. 
And America's ex-lover and co-defendant 
would never whisper to the sketch artist   
at America's trial: "You forgot the horns.   
Charles Graner may or may not have horns, 
but America is horn-free. America does not 
torture prisoners. America may render them,   
fully clothed, to Egypt or Syria, for further   
interrogation, or to men like Charles Graner,   
but America is not, ipso facto, Egypt or Syria,   
and Charles Graner is not now nor has he ever 
been America. And don't talk to me about 
Guantanamo. Please! Let's get this straight.   
You and I know who America is. We know   
what America does and doesn't do, because we 
(not Charles Graner!) are America. Am I right?   
Is this all clear? Tell me--am I right, or what?





Flesh of John Brown's Flesh: 2 December 1859
 

We knew the rules and punishments: 
three lashes for lack of diligence, 
eight for disobeying mother 

or telling lies.... No blood, he'd say, 
and no remission. Came a day 
he started keeping my account, 

as at a store. And came another 
he called me to the tannery: 
a Sunday, day of settlement. 

I'd paid one-third the owed amount 
when he, to my astonishment, 
handed the blue-beech switch to me. 

Always, the greatest of my fears 
were not his whippings, but his tears, 
and he was tearful now. I dared 

not disobey, nor strike him hard. 
"I will consider a weak blow 
no blow at all, rather a show 

of cowardice, he said. No blood 
and no remission. Thus he paid 
himself the balance that I owed, 

our mingled blood a token of 
a thing that went unnamed: his love. 
This nation, too, is his bad child, 

fails him utterly, drives him wild 
with rage and grief and will be scourged 
nearly to death before she, purged, 

may rise and stand. No blood, I hear 
him saying still, and no remission. 
So hang him today, Virginia; cheer 

his body swaying in the air-- 
tomorrow you will learn what's true: 
hanging's a thing he's done for you.





Cruising 99
 

for Lawson Fusao Inada and Alan Chong Lau
I. 

A Porphyry of Elements  

Starting in a long swale between the Sierras 
   and the Coast Range, 
Starting from ancient tidepools of a Pleistocene sea, 
Starting from exposed granite bedrock, 
From sandstone and shale, glaciated, river-worn, 
   and scuffed by wind, 
Tired of the extremes of temperature, 
   the weather's wantonness, 
Starting from the survey of a condor's eye 
Cutting circles in the sky over Tehachapi and Tejon, 
Starting from lava flow and snow on Shasta, 
   a head of white hair, 
   a garland of tongue-shaped obsidian, 
Starting from the death of the last grizzly, 
The final conversion of Tulare County 
   to the internal-combustion engine, 
Staring from California oak and acorn, 
   scrubgrass, rivermist, 
   and lupine in the foothills, 
From days driving through the outfield clover 
   of Modesto in a borrowed Buick, 
From nights drinking pitchers of dark 
   in the Neon Moon Bar & Grill, 
From mornings grabbing a lunchpail, work gloves, 
   and a pisspot hat, 
From Digger pine and Douglas fir and aspen around Placerville, 
From snowmelt streams slithering into the San Joaquin, 
From the deltas and levees and floods of the Sacramento, 
From fall runs of shad, steelhead, and salmon, 
From a gathering of sand, rock, gypsum, clay, 
   limestone, water, and tar, 
From a need or desire to throw your money away 
   in The Big City, 
From a melting of history and space in the crucible 
   of an oil-stained hand-- 
Starting from all these, this porphyry of elements, 
   this aggregate of experiences 
Fused like feldspar and quartz to the azure stone 
   of memory and vision, 
Starting from all of these and an affectionate eye 
   for straight, unending lines, 
We hit this old road of Highway Ninety-Nine!

Cruising in the Greater Vehicle/A Jam Session 

"Well, goddamnit, Lawson! Whyn't you play in key and keep to the 
rhythm? First you say you wanna go back to Fresno, back to the fish store 
and Kamaboko Gardens on the West Side, and then you say, forget it, I 
take it back, let's go to the Sacto Bon-Odori instead. 

"Yeah. And this ain't even shoyu season yet, chump! 

"Awww, hell. What's wrong with you two? Can't you improvise? You 
know, I'm just laying down a bass, man. Just a rhythm, a scale, 
something to jam on, something to change, find our range, something to 
get us going. Once we get started, we can work our way around to Weed, 
put on some tire chains, or break down in Selma, refuse to buy grapes, 
raisins, or Gallo, do a pit-stop at a Sacto sporting goods, pick up some air 
mattresses shaped like pearl-diving women, and float all day downriver to 
the deltas, sipping Cokes and sak in the summer heat. 

"Shit. Whyn't you just solo and forget the rest of us? You start chanting 
and pretty soon we're hearing the entire Lotus Sutra. 

"You two Buddhaheads just a pair of one-eyed Japs with dishpan hands 
and deadpan minds, man. This is the Champ Chonk talking, and we're 
playing Chinese anaconda. Eight-card, no-peek pak-kai, roll your own, 
hi-lo, three for sweep, four for hot-sour soup stud, and neither of you's 
put down your ante yet. So shit or get off the shu-mai, fellas. 

"Calm down and watch the road, Alan. 

"Who's driving this heap, anyway? 

"I thought you were. 

"I thought Lawson was. 

"Don't worry. This is a dodo-driven, autopiloted, cruise-controlled, Triple- 
A-mapped, Flying-A-gassed, dual-overhead-cam, Super-Sofistifunktified, 
Frijole Guacamole, Gardena Guahuanco, Chonk Chalupa Cruiser with 
Buddha Bandit Bumpers, Jack! 

"Where we going, Alan? 

"Where do you think? We're going to Paradise. 

IV. 

On the Road to Paradise 

Distances don't matter 
nor the roll of the road past walnut groves. 
It's sky that counts, 
the color of it at dawn or sunset, 
a match more true to the peach 
than a mix of oils by Matisse. 
Or maybe it's actually the weather 
we love most, the way it shifts 
and scatters over the state 
like radio waves bouncing off the face of the moon. 
The one over there, near Yuba City, 
rising over a backyard garden 
of onions, tomatoes, squash, and corn. 
The one with the spider 
scrambling through celery, 
harvesting moths and mayflies 
from the web it has strung between stalks. 
Sometimes I wish I could harvest the weather, 
reap it like wheat or rice, 
store it in a silo 
announcing steady rain or clear skies on its sides. 
When the prices rise, 
I could ship hailstorms or Santanas in orange crates, 
make Safeway go broke, 
do something politically efficacious for a change. 
But all I really do besides write these poems 
is allow my mind to wander while I drive. 
There it goes, down the arroyo, 
through manzanita and Mormon tea. 
Or there, up the mustard and Indian pipe on the hill. 
Might as well let it. 
Nothing but God and Country on the radio now. 
Wolfman Jack's syndicated and the Dodgers 
haven't made it to Vero Beach. 
I wish this road would turn or bend, 
intersect with a spy movie some Spanish galleon, 
or maybe a Chinese poem with landscapes 
in brocade, mist, wine, and moonlight. 
This California moon is yellow most of the time, 
like it was stained with nicotine, 
or sealed in amber like an insect. 
Why is it always better somewhere else? 
Why do I always wish I were Tu Fu?

 Palmistry Fantasia 
 

There, the pasteboard and neon hand! 
Just past the interchange by the bowling alley. 
The one with silver rockets, small green stars, 
and a trail of red comets flashing through the smog. 

It's still here, the hand 
held up in greeting or command. 
"Halt! it says, or 
"Peace be with you, brother, 
while the map across its palm 
traces excursions into blue trees, 
green skies, and mushroom-colored lives. 

Blue dun is the color of its neon, 
the same as the throat feathers of a teal 
scudding over the marshes of Merced. 
It matches the purple mascara the gypsy woman wears, 
matches the pools of velvet-blue darkness in her eyes. 

Her name is Alma Josephina, 
and she designed the sign herself, 
imitating the figure of her own hand, 
the neon indicative of its natural aura. 

That was twenty years ago 
when Eisenhower was President 
and all her customers wore pedal pushers 
or Bermudas, and never noticed 
the fireflies in the marshes at night. 

                           * 

You're Oriental, aren't you? 
Can you read tea leaves? 
I tried to once, years ago, 
had a Chinese woman teaching me, 
but her fees were too steep. 

I like a joke. 
It loosens up the customers. 

Well, come here towards the light. 
Let me get a good look 
at the ghosts in the grave of your palm. 
They're there, you know. 
All the people you've ever been, 
all the trips you've taken 
and the towns you've settled in, 
back before the birth of Christ, 
back before people were people, 
before this paw was a hand. 

You see?   The whole palm glows 
like purple mist over a cemetery. 
Move closer.   Clamp it around the glass. 
See it flare on the inside? 
That's the light your bones make, 
not the crystal at all. 

Look at your hand now. 
You can see yourself dancing 
on the heel just above the wrist. 
You must be a happy man. 
You'll be born again and again, 
get to the threshold of Heaven, 
never enter but keep coming back, 
here, for fun, for friends, 
until this will be Paradise, 
and Paradise just an old resort 
the highway's passed by. 

Well, have a nice trip. 
You'll make it yet. 
Says so right in that curvy line 
around the Mound of Venus, 
that thumbstump there, 
right where the long straight line 
cuts across like an interstate.

Postcards Sent Home 

1.    
Dust rolls out of the hills like fog, 
and it's too hot for shoes or shirts. 
I'd like to take my hair off too, 
peel it from my head, dip it in a bucket of ice, 
and wear it around my neck like a bandana. 

2. 
Crickets attend the night, 
add a falsetto drone 
to the sound of us 
pissing in the tumbleweeds. 

3.    
There's a Tastee-Freeze in Fresno, 
A & Dub's closed down, 
Jack-in-the-Box keeps popping up, 
and McDonald's owns the town. 

4.    
Somebody's drying tobacco leaves 
on the laundry line. 
There, see them furl 
and flap next to the nylons? 

5. 
A giant oak uncurls over the road, 
sprinkles a fine yellow powder on the windshield. 
The sun hits, touches it off 
in a spasm of golden-red light.

Body & Fender/Body & Soul 

At the grill, the Indian girl with buckteeth and dimples serves us a round 
of coffee and sweet rolls. We're waiting for the guy at Henley's Texaco, 
down the street, to find us a fan belt that'll fit.   It's early, the sky's still in 
the john, shaving, and the sports page has to wait to get in. Everybody's 
grumpy. We sit around, jab at raisins with our forks, and try to look as 
tough as the waitresss. 

                           Her name's Rita. Her brothers jump fires and pump 
oil in Alaska. Her sisters string beads and make babies back on the Res. 
Her ex is white, a logger who threatened never to come back and didn't. 
She doesn't hold any grudges. That's why she's so nice, why she pops her 
gum filling the salt and pepper shakers, why she adjusts her girdle so we 
can see, why the egg spot on her dress doesn't show. 
                                              
                                             Outside, the sun eases up over 
the parking lot, scrambles across the freeway, and runs for cover behind a 
pile of pumpkin-colored clouds. 99 starts shuffling its deck of cars and 
pickups, getting set to deal a hand of nine-to-five stud. We don't watch.    
This is Redding, and ain't nothing thing going on besides the day shift. 

                                             Alan says, "Look, there's Venus, and 
points to a piece of light draining the sky. I want to order a country- 
fried steak, talk about the Dodgers, but there isn't time. Lawson hums a 
few chords, stirring the changes with his coffee spoon. 
                                     
                                                               Rita cruises back like 
a bus bound for Reno, starts dealing some ashtrays. She says, "How's it 
going boys? 

               I answer for all of us--"Hey, Rita. It's almost gone. 

VIII. 

Pilgrimage to the Shrine 

Six hours since 
the Paradise Cutoff 
and running on empty. 
No gas stations or rest stops, 
no weigh station, no cops. 
Just miles of straight road 
and a long double-yellow 
unrolling in front of us. 

Alan recognized nothing. 
Lawson pops the glove, 
pulls out a penlight, 
and fingers the map, 
pronouncing a few mantras. 

Our headlights slide 
over a scarecrow 
made of tumbleweeds 
standing by the road. 

He's wearing a kimono, 
a dark-blue stovepipe hat, 
his shoulders cloaked 
in a wreath of chrysanthemums. 

We pull over, 
back up, 
and he disappears 
into the pale- 
grey darkness. 

It's smoke. 
We can smell it, 
so somebody's 
got to be 
close by. 

But our eyes 
go blined, fill 
with tears and ashes 
as we stumble 
down the off-ramp. 

The smell of 
frying trout 
and steamed rice 
reaches us when 
we come to. 

An old hermit, 
dressed like the scarecrow, 
crawls out of his barracks 
and brings us tea. 

"Drink! he says, 
"It'll pick you up! 
And so we drink, 
feeling drugged. 

Soft blues 
in the key 
of sleep 
suffocates the air. 

From up the mountain, 
the sound of obsidian, 
flaking in the wind. 
Clouds of black glass 
waltz around us. 

We dress ourselves 
in shrouds of tule reeds 
stitched with barbed wire, 
stained with salt and mud. 

We refuse to cry. 

We drift back 
to the highway, 
holding our fists 
like rattles, 
shaking them 
like bones.

Confessions of the Highway/The Hermit Speaks 

I know the rituals, the spells of grapes, 
the ceremonies of tomatoes, celery, and rice. 
I know the color of wind dressed for fiesta, 
and the names of carnivals in Spanish and Japanese. 
I am familiar with the determination of campesinos 
who migrate up and down the stretch of the state 
in search of crops ready for harvest. 
It's all a dull ache in my back, 
small cuts on the throats of my fingers, 
and the alkali of a dry lake in my lungs. 
For me, the oracle of the giant orange 
always predicts good fortune, 
yet, it never comes true. 
My stomach is full of sand and tar, 
a little bit of paint, a few crickets. 
I stand in swampwater up to my hips, 
and the stink of rotting figs 
escapes my armpits in small brown clouds. 
Scrub oak and tumbleweed sprout from my scalp, 
make a small grove behind my left ear. 
I don't know why sparrows and starlings 
refuse to approach me, to take the grass seed 
tucked in the cuffs of my trousers. 
Maybe it's the stain of asphalt around my ankles, 
this copper sheen of sweat on my back. 
Sometimes, when the valley heat 
makes the bones in my feet 
start to hiss and burn, 
the desire to escape comes over me again. 
I can't help it. 
My arms pull down a few telephone posts, 
my shoulders churn against the bindings. 
I feel myself wanting to sit up, 
begin to walk again, and thresh my way 
across rice fields and acres of alfalfa. 
For once I'd like to lift my face 
straight above Shasta into the sky, 
shout in unison with thunder, 
roar with the assurance of Santana wind, 
leap out of these bonds of copper and steel, 
slough off this skin of cement, 
and walk south or north or even west 
into the weather and the sea.





Something Whispered in the Shakuhachi
 

No one knew the secret of my flutes, 
and I laugh now 
because some said I was enlightened. 
But the truth is 
I'm only a gardener 
who before the War 
was a dirt farmer and learned 
how to grow the bamboo 
in ditches next to the fields, 
how to leave things alone 
and let the silt build up 
until it was deep enough to stink 
bad as night soil, bad 
as the long, witch-grey 
hair of a ghost. 

No secret in that. 

My land was no good, rocky, 
and so dry I had to sneak 
water from the whites, 
hacksaw the locks off the chutes at night, 
and blame Mexicans, Filipinos, 
or else some wicked spirit 
of a migrant, murdered in his sleep 
by sheriffs and wanting revenge. 
Even though they never believed me, 
it didn't matter--no witnesses, 
and my land was never thick with rice, 
only the bamboo 
growing lush as old melodies 
and whispering like brush strokes 
against the fine scroll of wind. 

I found some string in the shed 
or else took a few stalks 
and stripped off their skins, 
wove the fibers, the floss, 
into cords I could bind 
around the feet, ankles, and throats 
of only the best bamboos. 
I used an ice pick for an awl, 
a fish knife to carve finger holes, 
and a scythe to shape the mouthpiece. 

I had my flutes. 

                           * 

When the War came, 
I told myself I lost nothing. 

My land, which was barren, 
was not actually mine but leased 
(we could not own property) 
and the shacks didn't matter. 

What did were the power lines nearby 
and that sabotage was suspected. 

What mattered to me 
were the flutes I burned 
in a small fire 
by the bath house. 

                           * 

All through Relocation, 
in the desert where they put us, 
at night when the stars talked 
and the sky came down 
and drummed against the mesas, 
I could hear my flutes 
wail like fists of wind 
whistling through the barracks. 
I came out of Camp, 
a blanket slung over my shoulder, 
found land next to this swamp, 
planted strawberries and beanplants, 
planted the dwarf pines and tended them, 
got rich enough to quit 
and leave things alone, 
let the ditches clog with silt again 
and the bamboo grow thick as history. 

                           * 

So, when it's bad now, 
when I can't remember what's lost 
and all I have for the world to take 
means nothing, 
I go out back of the greenhouse 
at the far end of my land 
where the grasses go wild 
and the arroyos come up 
with cat's-claw and giant dahlias, 
where the children of my neighbors 
consult with the wise heads 
of sunflowers, huge against the sky, 
where the rivers of weather 
and the charred ghosts of old melodies 
converge to flood my land 
and sustain the one thicket 
of memory that calls for me 
to come and sit 
among the tall canes 
and shape full-throated songs 
out of wind, out of bamboo, 
out of a voice 
that only whispers.

            What the fuck did they want, these men who needed the

It was casting time for The Young Lions. 
Brando wouldn't hesitate given this chance to dye 
his hair white and do a German 

accent. And while no one would hire Monty Clift 
after his facially disfiguring car-wreck, 
Brando convinced the studio that the other, slightly 

older, kid from Omaha was the right man. 
No one could play a more sensitive-tough than Monty, 
like the artist-bugler-boxer Prewitt 

mistaken for the enemy, gunned down 
by his own men in the Pearl Harbor dawn; 
or the way, as the seraphic cowboy Matt Dunson, 

he got a rise out of his demented empire builder 
father, John Wayne, by kicking over a tin cup, 
sloshing the coffee into the dust to show his disgust. 

Clift knew that Lions director Edward Dmytryk 
was searching for someone to play a key 
supporting role--as Frank Sinatra had in From Here To 

Eternity--yet he was stunned to hear it was 
"Jerry Lewis's partner in shlock. 
Clift softened, nauseated when he saw 

Martin's competition 
pander to the crowd on Broadway. 
Lucky for Monty that he let it go: the two men 

not only became friends; it was Dean 
who put the man with the wired-jaw to bed 
when he had the chloral hydrate and alcohol wobblies. 

Ignorant of Brando's intervention on his behalf, 
Monty told Dean that Marlon's fifty takes per scene 
were getting on his nerves more and more 

and he vowed to walk off the set if he tried 
ONE MORE TIME to have his German soldier die 
with arms spread wide to "echo the crucifixion. 

Clift, wasted with self-recrimination at forty-five. 
Martin, an actor for whom one run through a scene 
almost always sufficed. 

Dean got a chuckle out of Monty with his response. 
"It should be awful good with so many takes. 
Then the future flashed before him. 

"I guess there are directors who want us to do 
the same scene over and over again too. 
"Sure, lots. Some of the best. 

"I guess I got spoiled. Jerry and I got 
to where we pretty much called the shots. 
And then--without any foreknowledge 

that he'd be doing his only two other 
serious roles in the next two years 
and be subject to directorial rule on the sets of 

Some Came Running and Rio Bravo-- 
he vowed in the future to set up his golf net 
before shooting started on a picture. 

Dean appeared to float, perfection 
never an aspiration: that he was already as well known 
for his insouciance and drunk persona as for 

his singing and acting doesn't mean he was so well-defended 
that he didn't feel any pressure about working 
with such aces as Brando and Clift. 

He didn't have to stretch to play a would-be draft dodger, 
Michael Whiteacre: "a likeable coward like myself, 
a screenwriter in Shaw's novel, a singer in the movie. 

The army doctor feeds Dean his first line in Lions 
as if his future were visible in the instant: 
art and life exquisitely commingled. 

Doctor: "For a man your age and in your profession 
you're in excellent health. How do you manage it? 
Martin doesn't hesitate: "Clean liquor. 

But sauntering through this role didn't mean 
everything was swell: he felt so out-of-place 
on location in France he gave up the offer of 

a choice part in The Guns of Navarone 
because it meant going back to Europe. 
In his middle years, he ambled through the role 

of "Matt Helm in another toneless 
Bondian takeoff, and when Columbia 
wanted to shoot Murderers' Row 

on location in Cannes, Dino 
set the studio straight: "fuck no, 
just build some fake Riviera sets. 


                                                      2 

A diffident crooner, he needed a stooge. 
License to fuck around on stage. 
After his split with Jerry, Dino's drunk persona grew 

into a ghostly partner, and by the time he had his own TV show 
the public was so saturated with his presence, 
many conflated the persona and the person. 

When he landed the drunk's key role in Rio Bravo, 
he turned to Brando for help, "what should I do? 
Brando told him what to think about. 

The more inscrutable the subject 
the more this spectre stands out in relief. 
Part of Martin's appeal was that no one knew him. 

It wasn't a mask; his detachment was who he was. 
He showed up, his spirit remained elsewhere. 
His wives and children found him unknowable. 

It wasn't personal. When the Martins entertained, 
the guests carried on while Dino disappeared 
into his room to watch westerns on TV, alone. 

It wasn't personal. When the producer of 
"The Colgate Comedy Hour suggested they have lunch 
to get to know one another, Dino 

set him straight: "No one gets to know me. 
Martin was a man no one came close to knowing. 
What does it mean, to know someone? 


                                                      3 

Why ask such questions at all after Socrates 
beguiled us out of answers and set us on 
the inexhaustible path...dialectics? 

Don't you think I haven't wondered if I haven't 
strayed from my true path as I find myself 
tracking the trajectory of such non-exemplary lives? 

You're thinking it's a trick, and will not answer, 
but before you judge my dissolute subject-- 
who like the money but thought all the attention 

was a joke because "a singer is nothing-- 
as a derelict choice, consider how philosophy, 
while striving to become more concrete 

continues to recoil before the problem of other minds. 
And it is said that Monsieur Sartre turned paler 
than his martini, when Raymond Aron 

challenged the Husserlians, at the Bec de Gaz 
in Montparnasse, to make philosophy 
out of a cocktail glass. 


                                                      4 

There's something about everyone no one can know. 
There was no question of Dino taking orders 
and being bossed around was out of bounds: 

penalty shot incurred for the perpetrator, 
who was, this time, the imperious Billy Wilder 
whose streak of hits was breaking fast. 

Dino as always was doing his job, 
which was to literally play himself in Kiss Me, 
Stupid, and Billy had the balls 

to cap an interview at the Hollywood Press Club 
with this tactless pearl: "stars don't mean a thing. 
Was this because of what Stupid might have been 

had Marilyn, whose presence he had counted on, 
not done herself in? Was Wilder gambling 
that fellow exiles from the Reich, 

Lang, von Stroheim, and even the ghosts 
of Lubitsch, Brecht and Thomas Mann 
would have been there to applaud and acknowledge 

that he, from a younger generation of German exiles, 
was one of them? 
Dino didn't brood. Dino didn't blow. 

There would be no humiliating histrionics. 
He would put Wilder in his place 
with a letter, denouncing him as an arrogant 

and self-important son-of-a-bitch. 
Without angling for the director's respect, 
he got it, and more. 

After six weeks of delectable footage 
with Peter Sellers--whose American debut 
was to have been in Stupid-- 

as the small town piano teacher 
intent on writing a hit song 
and enlisting Dino to "get it in the right hands 

the tetchy "thirty-nine year old actor had a massive 
coronary, yet not long after landing in Heathrow 
found the breath to bitch to the press 

about crowds on the set, wrote a letter 
vilifying Wilder and Hollywood, 
and swore never to return. 

Wilder was used to being the abuser, not the abused. 
He had to take it out on someone and no one better 
to park at than Sellers' replacement, 

Ray Walston, as they reshot scenes. 
Ray was cowed.   Dino knew it. 
Ray observed that Dino was never without a glass 

in hand but assumed (wrongly) that it was filled 
with ginger ale instead of vodka. 
Which Dino was this, the persona or the person? 

Dino advised Ray, IN A VOICE LOUD ENOUGH 
SO THAT EVERYONE ONE THE SET COULD HEAR 
to "tell that cocksucker to go fuck himself and do it your own way. 

Wilder went wild. Martin practice putting. 
"If you wanted an actor, what the fuck did you get me for. 
Why didn't you get fucking Marlon Brando. 

It was as if Dino, who'd boxed in his youth 
under the pseudonym "Kid Crochet, 
had sucker-punched the dictator, who found himself 

disarmed by this unflappable and far from ugly, 
American. Dino's aplomb had Wilder 
on the floor, howling with laughter, just as night- 

club audiences used to crack up 
out of sheer anticipation of the antics to come 
while waiting for Martin and Lewis 

to begin their act...which knew no limits. 
They didn't break rules, they made them up 
as they went along, as when they leapt from the stage 

followed by floodlights in Fort Lee, New Jersey, 
to chase a slender tall brunette in a white dress 
down the aisle, chanting, in imitation moron-- 

"we know where you're going, we know where you're going-- 
because she had the nerve to leave her seat 
before they'd finished their act. 

She was mortified, but not for long. 
They had no way of knowing that a young 
woman who was that well put together 

could be as painfully self-conscious 
as this anonymous girl, who within a few 
years would become my mother. 


                                                      5 

There is something beautiful and horrible 
about Dino's incarnation of cool. 
Anger sublimated into a mask 

that would not harden, could not crack. 
Dino did not end in ruin, like the others. 
His falling away was gradual. 

His lifelong withdrawal, prelude to silence. 
Henry Miller had finally gotten Tropic of Cancer 
through the courts. He'd spent his life 

in quest of freer spirits than his own, 
and now, after Rimbaud and Lawrence 
and The Colossus of Maroussi, 

he found in Martin a priest of irreverence 
who was beyond nihilism, 
who shrugged off everything the doom culture 

deemed valuable, and pulled strings to be 
granted an audience with the man 
who made heavy weather of nothing. 


                                                      6 

Driving home to the suburbs during rush hour 
in the huge gas-guzzling cars that signified 
America's boom economy in the 1960's, 

married men without time sighed for the first 
time all day when "Houston came on the a.m. 
Then, back in their gaudy palaces at last, 

they stacked Martin's LP's 
on the turntable while mixing martinis. 
Was it the faade that never cracked, never changed guises? 

And isn't facade precisely the wrong term for one man's 
unchanging way of being in the world? 
Dean would say that's it's a waste to waste this wasted 

unasked for sojourn on earth thinking about shit 
like what others think of us, or depressing shit, 
like "the fucking Cold War or Vietnam, 

or rip-off artists like the Beatles 
("why do they spell it with an a'?). 
Jealous? Never. Only annoyed that they kept bugging him 

with questions. Why did he have to think? 
Wasn't it enough just to live? Dino didn't work 
to see his voice or image reproduced; 

he acted, sang, and hosted shows, on screen 
and in person, because it was easier than real 
work. 

Dino liked his inflated wages, but money 
meant nothing beyond what it could buy. 
"A singer is nothing. Why did he sing? 

It was the easiest way to make a bundle. 
When anyone complained that acting was hard word 
Dino responded as Crocetti, the barber's son 

from Steubenville: "You think acting's work? 
Try standing on your feet 
twelve hours a day dealing Blackjack. 


                                                      7 

If you agree that Dino lived to live on his own terms, 
and if his triumphs were in the significant films 
where he had allowed himself to take 

direction, listen, learn, tremble and transcend, 
then his second greatest trope 
after inventing himself 

was convincing producers and directors 
to let him play a character 
who sang and drank and thought about golf more than god, 

so that the actor and the part were entirely one. 
His string of walk-through roles 
was like a continuous aside 

to his audience, dissolving the boundary 
between actor and spectator 
and giving birth to a suspect and shadowy intimacy.





What is this about losing respect?
 

What is this about losing respect? 

Do I have to talk about it? 
He said he feared what I might 
write about him when he was gone, 
and I told him not to worry. 

He worried about the "streak of morbidity in your work. 

He was a man of God, not of imagination. 

And it wasn't his fault if he got the shakes. 
It was a familial tremor, not nerves. 

And it first happened at a gravesite. 

Near where Brigham Young did his number--"this is the place. 

He called him Friggin Young. 

Well, during his bleak tenure in Greenville, 
his congregants would tell nigger jokes 
and he would force a smile--afraid now to rock the boat-- 
a mere exercise in stretching 
                the corners of his lips-- 
a fake grin he would have noted 
on another face--false faces being 
            one of the things we loved 
to laugh about when together we observed congregants' idiosyncracies, 
their ruses, their guises, 

like one temple president, the son 
         of the "richest Jew in Salt Lake 
who, seated in the pulpit's other red velvet wing chair, 
         would expose the holes in the soles of his shoes 
while he batted his eyelashes to 
         wake himself up-- 

(though I owe him one: "Rosencavalier 
didn't turn me in for copying 
         the wrong answers from Mary Weinstein 
on our "final exam in Sunday 
         school prior to       confirmation. 

He was ashamed for me, 
                                          young Rosencavalier. 

He could hardly disguise 
         the curled lips and downcast eyes 
         of his contempt 
         for this lawless "Rabbi's son 
         whether or not my name 
         was Strome or Rudman, 

but where teaching Judaism was concerned 
         his plodding methodical 
reading to keep up each week 
         was a pathetic substitution 
for Sidney's well-wrought, impromptu riffs. 

                                              So there!) 

Marty was ashamed of me. 
I left town. 

As night was falling?

In Utah you can drive at fifteen so by age 
fourteen a lot of our talk 
was hard core car talk 

and somehow the word 
Volkswagen came up 
after confirmation class 

(it was no GTO but you could drive 
so far on so little gas...) 
and Marty's father--a redhead like his son-- 

made his way up the driveway's ice, 
smoke billowing from the exhaust 
of whatever sleek black foreign car he drove. 

Pulling on his elegant pigskin gloves 
he announced he'd "never buy a Kraut    car. 
I was    bewildered 

(what, hold against a country now 
something that happened so long    ago?) 
and he held my gaze 

and I shivered inside the shiver I felt 
from the cold    I thought he would 
transmogrify into a southern sheriff 

and ask "what kind of    Jew are you    boy 
but he didn't have to say 
another word. 


                                             * 

In other words you were ready to leave town. 

I'd had it with Utah. 

But you wanted to stay in the west, against your father's wishes?  

Yes. 

Unequivocally? 

Yes. Yes. Yes. 

But you did submit to psychiatrists and interviews with the heads of schools 
during your sojourn in the east that summer? 

Yes. I didn't say I wasn't ambivalent and/or confused. 

Nothing more, your honor. 


                                             * 

This was around the time, was it not, that a certain "Penny, from Los 
Angeles, a family friend of your grandfather's, came to dinner in Salt Lake 
City... 

She was a small woman, slightly hunchbacked, who spoke in a low 
voice. She was one of my mother's major confidantes. My mother had a 
great respect for her because she was the buyer for I. Magnin's. When 
the subject of my father came up, as it always did, Penny, fueled by 
several Scotches, seemed to retract her head into her chest and when it 
reemerged she spat out this sentence about Charles: "Why he'd stick his 
prick into anything! 

I blanched. My features stiffened with rage.   Sensual and tormented man 
that he was, whatever he was, what right did they have to tear him down 
in front of me! She put her leathered multi-braceleted hand on my hand 
and said, "It's all right, dahlink. I said, "I've never seen him do any- 
thing like that. And they continued. "Well he used to screw the maid, 
my mother threw in wearily. 

How did they know so much about him, this shadow, this spectre? 

Everyone knew. 

There she was, this tiny hunchback, almost a dwarf--this was how she 
conceived of loyalty to my mother. In reality, it was another patronizing 
blow, as if my mother had to hear the worst in order not to feel that the 
failure of the marriage might have been her failure. 

And while they sat there tearing him down the phone rang and it was-- 
guess who. Your mother handed the phone over to Sidney who, geared for 
battle, bourbon happy, quarreled with your father about the precise details 
as to where you should go when you "left town. They had come to an 
impasse in the conversation when it seems your father said something like 
"you can't talk to Charles K. Rudman that way and Sidney said--because 
this you overheard--"what does the K' stand for--and your father said-- 
according to Sidney--"cocksucker. 

And Sidney howled. He would rag him till the end of his days. "Is this 
Charles K. Rudman? 

I didn't call you a cocksucker, Sidney said, 
 
but since you said it i 
heard you were a cocksucker. 

 
I didn't say it! 

"I am, your father was rumored to have said, probably (possibly?) not 
meaning it literally, but more within the vernacular of street language, 
curse-words meaning "sonofabitch, not someone who literally "sucked 
cocks. 

I think so. 

Your heart went out to your poor father at that moment, didn't it? Sidney 
had a way of miscalculating the effect of these shots on you. You knew your 
father was writhing in an agony of frustration. 

Yes. 

But Sidney was running with it, relishing Charles' self-hatred, his masoch 
-ism which erupted at that moment out of frustration...And for years he 
loved to tell the story of how Charles "called himself a cocksucker, always 
underscoring the anecdote by absolving himself, by making it clear that it 
wasn't he who first used the word. 

He really rubbed it in. 

Can you forgive him? 


                                             * 

Only now that he's dead can I let myself feel 
how good we were at leaving each other alone.





Tomahawk
 

My deaf cousin had a hand in designing the Tomahawk Missile. 
The blueprints open on his desk for what was to become 
a show-and-tell-style reunion. 

I hadn't laid eyes on this exuberant man since chance 
threw us together at a party given by his best friend 
whose brother was your real father's best friend, 

and whose blind nephew appeared, shook my hand, 
and, unprompted, said my name:--it was like a blessing. 
The deaf men nodded at the blind boy's recognition. 

They held me captive, these two deaf friends, and took forever 
with frantic mimicry explaining how they knew each other, 
firmly guiding the silent dialogue toward the bizarre 

intersection of fates: theirs, mine, my father's, my mother's.... 
The deaf find ways of contacting each other. 
They have their on watering holes. 

Did he place this decisive warhead above all other 
constructions executed during a working life spent 
gratefully, perhaps too gratefully, in the government's 

employ designing, mainly, destroyers...? 
Final proof he was not handicapped by his handicap? 
He married a deaf woman, but his two daughters 

are normal; I mean not deaf.... Both were present 
and married. One was pregnant. The other became 
more and more voluble as this Sunday marathon wore on. 

Conversation meant--: asking each other questions. 
My cousin scribbled answers alongside the next question 
on a pad that rustled like a pet hamster in his back pocket. 

It was work, talking to that generation's deaf. 
It was hard not to raise your voice. 
I caught my mother trying to catch my eye 

across the smoked fish infested spread 
as she mouthed a lipsticky    YOU    MUST    E NUN   CI   ATE 
Brain-dead from the labor of "catching up 

with veritable strangers with whom I was linked 
by blood, I wandered, coffee balanced in saucer, 
toward my cousin's study, in vain hope of tte-a-tte. 

He followed, hauled down sheafs from shelves, 
while I studied the framed sketches of ship's interiors. 
Had deafness helped him achieve these heights of invention? 

His face brightened.   He strained with strangled voice to answer. 
Even I could understand "That's the ticket, 
before he scrawled with Bic on pad. "Deaf...can think better.... 

I was about to say "Not all, that I was asking 
about him personally, when his daughter intervened 
and said, aloud and in sign, that this was "deafism. 

He signed: "No no, not hearing forced me... 
She signed and spoke, indulgent, resigned, admiring: 
"So deafness makes you superior? 

I liked the way she stood up to him, and the way he took it. 
Trying not to sound like a boorish upstart in a Q & A 
disingenuously grilling Oppenheimer, Einstein or Bohr 

with how they felt about their elegant theorems 
culminating in so much death, I asked if 
he was ambivalent about designing warheads. Question 

from left field. Bewilderment squared. 
His honked "Wa was like an inaudible "Come again? 
Forehead painfully wrinkled. Deep-set ridges. 

My stomach contracted: Oh God, what have I done? 
It wasn't me asking discomfiting questions to hound 
this dear, sweet, ebullient man, who had done his best...; 

it was my...duty to ask, which appeared to perplex 
this...disembodied intelligence...schooled in 
focusing on the problem to be solved just as 

Husserl bracketed words, [postponed] 
this longing to belong to sentences that mimicked 
meaningful action, and to block out the politics and social 

contexts that could...derail...the (beautiful) concord 
between pure thought and necessity. He had the right to think: 
Anyone can design a ship, or a missile, that works 

like a bigger bullet shot from a bigger gun; 
but to invent one that can stop, turn around, 
change directions, now that's--invention. 

She repeated the question in sign and came back 
with: "My father doesn't understand your question. 
I spoke more slowly. "You must feel proud at how 

the Tomahawk conducted itself during the Desert War. 
The praise sent him rocking. So that's what I took so long 
to say! He nodded exuberantly in accord. 

"Wait. Even though it was for a good cause 
doesn't it bother you that the missile 
killed many people. Question from left field. 

Flurry of signs between father and daughter. 
"My dad says war is horrible but once you're in 
it's important to win. "That was true before, 

and true as it pertained to the two world wars, 
but Southeast Asian...was another story. 
Groan of dismay. Why should a deaf engineer 

be forced to deal with relative ethics too...? War 
made the mental challenge of his work more 
challenging, as it did the group holed up at Los Alamos. 

The heart sinks when these higher mathematical formulations 
become subject to weather, and the stray jackrabbits and homo sapiens 
"who weren't supposed to be anywhere near the test site... 

This pacific man could not have thought about what the Tomahawk 
did to real live--now dead--people. 
He was too immersed in the question of how 

to get the missile to think, to take into account--the wind.





The Way
 

Card in pew pocket

The Cats Will Know
 

Rain will fall again 
on your smooth pavement, 
a light rain like 
a breath or a step. 
The breeze and the dawn 
will flourish again 
when you return, 
as if beneath your step. 
Between flowers and sills 
the cats will know. 

There will be other days, 
there will be other voices. 
You will smile alone. 
The cats will know. 
You will hear words 
old and spent and useless 
like costumes left over 
from yesterday's parties. 

You too will make gestures. 
You'll answer with words-- 
face of springtime, 
you too will make gestures. 

The cats will know, 
face of springtime; 
and the light rain 
and the hyacinth dawn 
that wrench the heart of him 
who hopes no more for you-- 
they are the sad smile 
you smile by yourself. 

There will be other days, 
other voices and renewals. 
Face of springtime, 
we will suffer at daybreak.





Smokers of Paper
 

He's brought me to hear his band. He sits in a corner 
mouthing his clarinet. A hellish racket begins. 
Outside, through flashes of lightning, wind gusts 
and rain whips, knocking the lights out 
every five minutes. In the dark, their faces 
give it their all, contorted, as they play a dance tune 
from memory. Full of energy, my poor friend 
anchors them all from behind. His clarinet writhes, 
breaks through the din, passes beyond it, releasing 
like a lone soul, into a dry, rough silence. 

The poor pieces of brass have been dented too often: 
the hands working the stops also work in the fields, 
and the obstinate brows stay fixed on the ground. 
Miserable worn-out blood, weakened 
by too many labors--you can hear it groan 
in their notes, as my friend struggles to lead them, 
his own hands hardened from swinging a hammer, 
from pushing a plane, from scraping a living. 

He's lost all his old comrades, and he's only thirty. 
Part of the postwar group that grew up on hunger. 
They all came to Turin, to look for a life, 
and discovered injustice. He learned, without smiling, 
how to work in a factory. He learned how to measure 
the hunger of others with his own fatigue-- 
injustice was everywhere. He tried to find peace 
by walking, at night, down streets without ends, 
half-asleep, but found only thousands of streetlamps 
blazing down on iniquity: hoarse women and drunks, 
staggering puppets, far from their homes, He came, 
one winter, to Turin--factory lights, smoke and ash-- 
and he learned what work is. He accepted that work 
was part of a man's hard fate; if all men did that, 
there just might be some justice in this world. 
And he found new comrades. He suffered their long words, 
he listened and waited for them to be over. 
He made them his comrades. Families of them 
in each house, the city surrounded by them, the face 
of the world covered with them. And each of them 
felt desperate enough to conquer the world. 

They sound harsh tonight, despite all the time 
he spent coaching each player. He ignores the loud rain 
and the flickering lights. His face is severe, 
fixed on some grief, almost biting the mouthpiece. 
I've seen this expression before, one evening, just us 
and his brother, who's ten years sadder than him. 
We were up late in the dim light, the brother studying 
a lathe he had built that didn't work right, 
and my poor friend cursing the fate that kept him there, 
bound to his hammer and plane, feeding a pair 
of old people he never asked for. 
                                                That's when he yelled 
that it wasn't fate that made the world suffer 
or made the daylight spark blasphemous outbursts: 
man is the guilty one. If we only could just leave, 
and be hungry and free, and say no 
to a life that uses our love and our piety, 
our families, our patches of dirt, to shackle our hands.





Sad Wine (I)
 

It's a fine fact that whenever I sit in a tavern corner 
sipping a grappa, the pederast's there, or the kids 
with their screaming, or the unemployed guy, 
or some beautiful girl outside--all breaking 
the thread of my smoke. That's how it is, kid, 
I'm telling it straight, I work at Lucento. 
But that voice, that sorrowful voice of the old man 
(forty-ish, maybe?) who shook my hand 
one night in the cold and then walked with me back 
to my house, that tone like an old cornet-- 
I'll never forget it, not even in death. 
He said nothing of wine, but spoke to me then 
because I had suffered and was smoking a pipe. 
"And pipe smokers, he declared, shaking a little, 
"can always be trusted! I nodded my head. 

I came back to find the girls friendlier, healthier, 
their skirts cut higher--this after months of hunger-- 
and I went and got married because I was drunk 
on all their freshness--a senile love. 
I married the sassiest, most muscular girl 
so I'd taste life again, so I wouldn't die 
behind a desk, in an office, surrounded by strangers. 
But Nella too was a stranger to me, and a student pilot 
saw her with me once, and later laid hands on her. 
He's dead now, that coward--that poor kid-- 
spun out of the sky--I guess I'm the coward. 
Now she's got her baby--who knows if he's mine-- 
and she's home all the time and I'm just a stranger 
who can't keep her happy. I don't dare say a word 
and neither does Nella, she just looks at me. 

It was beautiful how he cried as he told it, 
the way a drunk cries, his whole body to it, 
and he hung on my shoulder saying, Between us, 
always respect, and there I was, shaking with cold, 
wanting to leave, and helping him walk. 

Sipping grappa is nice, but there's also a pleasure 
in listening to the venting of an impotent old man 
who's back from the front and asks your forgiveness. 
What satisfaction will I ever have in this life? 
I'm telling it straight, I work at Lucento. 
What satisfaction will I ever have in this life?





Sad Wine (II)
 

The hard thing's to sit without being noticed. 
Everything else will come easy. Three sips 
and the impulse returns to sit thinking alone. 
Against the buzzing backdrop of noise 
everything fades, and it's suddenly a miracle 
to be born and to stare at the glass. And work 
(a man who's alone can't not think of work) 
becomes again the old fate that suffering's good 
for focusing thought. And soon the eyes fix 
on nothing particular, grieved, as if blind. 

If this man gets up and goes home to sleep, 
he'll look like a blind man that's lost. Anyone 
could jump out of nowhere to brutally beat him. 
A woman--beautiful, young--might appear, 
and lie under a man in the street, and moan, 
the way a woman once moaned under him. 
But this man doesn't see. He heads home to sleep 
and life becomes nothing but the buzzing of silence. 

Undressing this man you'd find a body that's wasted 
and, here and there, patches of fur. Who'd think, 
to look at this man, that life once burned 
in his lukewarm veins? No one would guess 
that there was a woman, once, who gently touched 
that body, who kissed that body, which shakes, 
and wet it with tears, now that the man, 
having come home to sleep, can't sleep, only moan.





Destiny
 

The chicken I bought last night, 
Frozen, 
Returned to life, 
Laid the biggest egg in the world, 
And was awarded the Nobel Prize. 

The phenomenal egg 
Was passed from hand to hand, 
In a few weeks had gone all round the earth, 
And round the sun 
In 365 days. 

The hen received who knows how much hard currency, 
Assessed in buckets of grain 
Which she couldn't manage to eat 

Because she was invited everywhere, 
Gave lectures, granted interviews, 
Was photographed. 

Very often reporters insisted 
That I too should pose 
Beside her. 
And so, having served art 
Throughout my life, 
All of a sudden I've attained to fame 
As a poultry breeder.





Fountains in the sea
 

Water: no matter how much, there is still not enough. 
Cunning life keeps asking for more and then a drop more. 
Our ankles are weighted with lead, we delve under the wave. 
We bend to our spades, we survive the force of the gusher. 

Our bodies fountain with sweat in the deeps of the sea, 
Our forehead aches and holds like a sunken prow. 
We are out of breath, divining the heart of the geyser, 
Constellations are bobbing like corks above on the swell. 

Earth is a waterwheel, the buckets go up and go down, 
But to keep the whole aqueous architecture standing its ground 
We must make a ring with our bodies and dance out a round 
On the dreamt eye of water, the dreamt eye of water, the dreamt eye of water. 

Water: no matter how much, there is still not enough. 
Come rain, come thunder, come deluged dams washed away, 
Our thirst is unquenchable. A cloud in the water's a siren. 
We become two shades, deliquescent, drowning in song. 

My love, under the tall sky of hope 
Our love and our love alone 
Keeps dowsing for water. 
Sinking the well of each other, digging together. 
Each one the other's phantom limb in the sea.





The Magus
 

The pearls, mere reminders. 
The ocean's rapid recoil, a signal. 
The gulls appeared enormous 

in that way only things from above can-- 
such is presentation of the sudden. 
If only this were worthy of a frame, 

the wooden gesture announcing 
a moment past were cherished. 
But it was too late for that, too late 

to answer the surf's anxious Why? 
too late to decline the continuous life 
he had resigned himself, turning 

away from the grave, that plot 
being too familiar to so many. 
Of course immortality had its price: 

first his staff he had taped back together, 
then the sleeves of his robe 
he had reclaimed from the depths, then 

the magic leached nightly from his fingertips 
so that now his incantation for a storm 
brought only a slight breeze, 

a quick sun shower that frightened 
only the flowers struggling in the salt air. 
Now, showing his centuries, he insists: 

This is the wind out of which I bring clouds. 
These are my hands that gnarled though they be 
when lifted to the sky bring rain.





Sunday Afternoon
 

for donald justice
Beyond the strings of water 
clinging to the windowpane, 

there were no cranes, just rain, 
a sky blurred by wet glass, 

a pond corrugated by raindrops, 
and, inside, the smell of naphthalene bars, 

a Victrola with a broken arm, 
a spotty daguerreotype, a dusty crinoline-- 

O mildewed, seersucker suits 
draped over vacant chairs.





Fundamentals of Esperanto
 

The grammatical rules of this language can be learned in one 
sitting. 

Nouns have no gender & end in -o; the plural terminates in -oj 
(pronounced -oy) & the accusative, -on (plural 0ojn). 

Amiko, friend; amikoj, friends; amikon & amikojn, accusative 
friend & friends. 

Adjectives end in a & take plural & accusative endings to 
agree with things. 

Ma amiko is my friend. 

All verbs are regular & have only one form for each tense or 
mood; they are not altered for person or number. Mi havas 
bonajn amikojn is simply to say I have good friends. 

Adverbs end in e. 

La bonaj amiko estas ie. The good friend is here.

A new book appears in Esperanto every week. Radio stations in 
Europe, the United States, China, Russia & Brazil broadcast in 
Esperanto, as does Vatican Radio. In 1959, UNESCO declared the 
International Federation of Esperanto Speakers to be in accord with 
its mission & granted this body consultative status. The youth 
branch of the International Federation of Esperanto Speakers, UTA, 
has offices in 80 different countries & organizes social events where 
young people curious about the movement may dance to recordings 
by Esperanto artists, enjoy complimentary soft drinks & take home 
Esperanto versions of major literary works including the Old 
Testament & A Midsummer Night's Dream. William Shatner's first 
feature-length vehicle was a horror film shot entirely in Esperanto. 
Esperanto is among the languages currently sailing into deep space 
on board the Voyager spacecraft.

Esperanto is an artificial language 
constructed in 1887 by L. 
    L. Zamenhof, a polish 
         oculist. I first came 
across Fundamento Esperanto, the text 
    which introduced this system 
            to the world, as I travelled abroad 

following a somewhat difficult period 
in my life. It was twilight & snowing on the 
    railway platform just outside 
         Warsaw where I had missed 
my connection. A man in a crumpled track suit 
    & dark glasses pushed a cart 
            piled high with ripped & weathered volumes-- 

sex manuals, detective stories, yellowing 
musical scores & outdated physics textbooks, 
    old copies of Life, new smut, 
         an atlas translated, 
a grammar, The Mirror, Soviet-bloc comics, 
    a guide to the rivers & 
            mountains, thesauri, inscrutable 

musical scores & mimeographed physics books, 
defective stories, obsolete sex manuals-- 
         one of which caught my notice 
         (Dr. Esperanto, 
Zamenhof's pen name, translates as He Who Hopes) & 
    since I had time, I traded 
         my used Leaves of Grass for a copy. 

- 

Mi amas vin, bela amiko. 
I'm afraid I will never be lonely enough. 
There's a man from Quebec in my head, 

a friend to the purple martins. 
Purple martins are the Cadillac of swallows. 
All purple martins are dying or dead. 
Brainscans of grown purple martins suggest 
these creatures feel the same levels of doubt 

& bliss as an eight-year-old girl in captivity. 
While driving home from the brewery 
one night this man from Quebec heard a radio program 
about purple martins & the next day he set out 
to build them a house 
in his own back yard. I've never built anything, 
let alone a house, 

not to mention a home 
for somebody else. 

I've never unrolled a blueprint onto a workbench, 
sunk a post, 
or sent the neighbor's kid pedalling off 
to the store for a bag full of nails. 

I've never waited ten years for a swallow. 

Never put in aluminum floors to smooth over the waiting. 
Never piped sugar water through colored tubes 
to each empty nest lined with newspaper shredded 
with strong, tired hands. 
Never dismantled the entire affair 

& put it back together again. 
Still no swallows. 
I never installed the big light that stays on through the night 

to keep owls away. Never installed lesser lights, 
never rested on Sunday 

with a beer on the deck surveying 
what I had done 
& what yet remained to be done, listening to Styx 

while the neighbor kids ran through my sprinklers. 
I have never collapsed in abandon. 
Never prayed. 
But enough about purple martins. 

- 

As we speak, Esperanto is being corrupted 
by upset languages such as Interlingua, 
Klingon, Java & various cryptophasic tongues. 

Our only hope of reversing this trend is to write 
the Esperanto epic. Through its grandeur 
& homegrown humility, it will spur men 

to freeze the mutating patios so the children 
of our children's children may dwell in this song 
& find comfort in its true texture & frame. 

It's worth a try. As I imagine it, it ends 
in the middle of things. Every line of the work 
is a first & a last line & this is the spring 

of its action. Of course, there's a journey 
& inside that journey, an implicit voyage 
through the underworld. There's a bridge 

made of boats; a carp stuffed with flowers; 
a comic dispute among sweetmeat vendors; 
a digression on shadows; men clapping 

in fields to scare away crows; an unending list 
of warships: The Unternehmen, The Impresa, 
The Muyarchi, Viec Lam, The Przedsiebiorstwo, 

The Indarka, The Enterprise, L'Entreprise, 
Entrepeno... One could go on. But by now, 
all the characters have turned into swallows 

& bank as one flock in the sky--that is, 
all except one. That's how we finally learn 
who the hero was all along. Weary & old, 

he sits on a rock & watches his friends 
fly by one by one out of the song, 
then turns back to the journey they all began 

long ago, keeping the river to his right.





For the South
 

I hate your hills white with dogwood 
or pink with redbud in spring 
as if you invented hope, as if 
in the middle of red clay, 
limestone outcroppings, 
and oak trees dead with fungus 
something slight and beautiful 
should make us smile. 

I hate the way honeysuckle drapes 
fences, blooms in the ditch   
where everyone dumps garbage; 
the evening air sweet with cedar 
and fields of burley; 
the way irises and buttercups 
mark the old dimensions of a house 
destroyed a hundred years ago; 
how a span of Queen Anne's lace 
rocks the whole moon, and the sumac 
runs dark against the hill. 

I hate the drawl, the lazy voice 
saying I've been away so long 
I sound like I'm from nowhere; 
the old hand gathering snowballs or peonies 
or forking up an extra dish of greens, 
bitter, just the way I like them.





The Future
 

(Detroit, 1950)
Because the jobs were there 
and a man could get rich 
working on the line, the South 
retreated North to Michigan, 
whole families eating crackers and baloney 
by the side of the road, 
changing drivers to keep 
moving through corn fields 
and foreign towns, 
sundown and darkness, 
the moon a prophecy of chrome, 
the stars 10 million headlights 
of the cars they would build. 

Ahead lay a city bright with steel; 
behind, the dark fields folded 
over everything they knew; 
and when they dozed 
on cramped back seats, they dreamed 
such dreams as the road can make, 
of drifting on a lake or stream 
or lying down in hay to dream of traveling, 
so that when they woke to a bump, 
a couch, a voice saying, "It's your turn, 
they were lost to themselves 
and took a few moments 
to remember their names. 

Mostly behind their backs, 
the locals called them 
rednecks, crackers, goddamned rebs. 
Strange to be strange, 
in their new neighborhoods, 
to be ethnic with a thick accent 
and a taste for food the grocers didn't stock-- 
hog jowl and blackeyes, turnip greens, 
roasting ears, souse-meat-- 
the butcher shrugging, 
the produce man shaking his head. 
Sometimes their own voices 
took them by surprise, 
sounding odd and out of place 
in the din of a city bus, ringing 
lost in the evening air when 
they called their children in for supper. 

At work they touched 
parts of tomorrow, 
next year's models always 
taking shape and vanishing, 
the present obsolete, the past 
merely a rumor, 
all hours blurring 
into one continuous moment 
of finishing a fragment, 
each piece the same piece, 
movements identical, 
endless, like a punishment in hell. 

No way out but back 
to their old lives, a future 
they already knew by heart, 
a few on the road each month 
in cars they may have helped assemble, 
tokens of their failed success, 
legacies for boys to find 
years later rusting on some lot, 
banged up but still a dream 
and fast enough when overhauled 
to make them feel they could blast 
straight into tomorrow, 
as they raced their engines at each stoplight 
and cruised their towns in circles.





Communications
 

Sent in after new ground was taken, 
my father ducked from ditch to shell-hole, 
unwinding the telephone cable behind him, 
a pfc. cast as Mercury, connecting   
the gods with the lesser gods. 

Funny to think of him trailing 
the complex filament of speech, 
that man, neither shy nor sullen, 
who answered only "Yes, "No, "Maybe, 
and never volunteered a private thought. 

Standing off with his hands in his pockets 
or cupping a cigarette, he seemed to be waiting 
with the great rural patience of fields 
for whatever might rise pure and nameless 
or fall from the sky beyond explanation. 

If anyone asked what he was thinking, 
he said, "Nothing, and when he died 
he rushed out leaving everything unsaid, 
uncoiling a dark line into darkness 
down which a familiar silence roars.





Ghetto Funeral
 

Followed by his lodge, shabby men stumbling over the 
    cobblestones,   
and his children, faces red and ugly with tears, eyes and 
    eyelids red, 
in the black coffin in the black hearse the old man. 

No longer secretly grieving 
that his children are not strong enough to go the way he 
    wanted to go 
and was not strong enough.





[His mother stepped about her kitchen . . .]
 

His mother stepped about her kitchen, complaining in a low   
    voice; 
all day his father sat stooped at a sewing machine. 
When he went to high school Webber was in his class. 
Webber lived in a neighborhood where the houses are set in 
    lawns with trees beside the gutters.   
The boys who live there, after school, take their skates and 
    hockey sticks and play in the streets until nightfall. 
At twelve o'clock the boys ran out of school to a lunchroom 
    around the corner. 
First come, first served, and they ran as fast as they could. 
Webber would run up beside him and knock him against the 
    wall. 
He tried not to mind and thought Webber would tire of it.   
One day he hit Webber's side; his fist fell off Webber's over- 
    coat. Webber turned with a glad shout and punched him 
    as he cowered. 
His home was in a neighborhood of workingmen where there 
    were few Jews.   
When he came home from school he walked as quickly as he could, 
his head bowed and cap pulled low over his face. 
Once, a few blocks from home, a tall lad stopped him.   
"Are you a Jew? I knock the block off every Jew I meet. 
    "No, he answered. 
"I think you're a Jew. What's your name? He told him, 
glad that his name was not markedly Jewish and yet foreign 
    enough to answer for his looks.   
"Where do you live? He told him and added, "Come around 
    any old time and ask about me. So he got away. 
When he was through high school he worked in the civil 
    service as a typist, taken on until a rush of business was 
    over. 
He took the test for a steady job, but his standing on the list 
    was low, 
unlikely to be reached for a long time, if ever before the new list. 
Looking for work, he always came upon a group waiting for   
    the job. 
He was short and weak-looking, and looked peevish. He could 
    not get work for months.   
At last an old German storekeeper wanted to hire him and 
    asked at what he had been working. He told him. 
"It doesn't pay me to break you in, if you are going to leave 
    me. Have you taken another civil service test? Are you 
    waiting for a new appointment? 
"No, he answered.   
In a few months a letter came to his home from the civil 
    service board, asking him to report for work as a typist, a 
    permanent appointment.   
There was no hurry, but his father did not know and so 
    brought the letter to the store. 

There had been a boy in his class at school whose name was 
    Kore. 
Kore was short, too, but he had the chest of an old sailor and 
    thick, bandy legs. He shouted when he spoke and was 
    always laughing. 
Kore moved into the block. With Kore he was not afraid to 
    stand on the stoop after work or go walking anywhere. 
Once they went to Coney Island and Kore wanted to go 
    bathing. It was late at night and no one else was in. 
They went along the beach until they came to the iron pier the 
    steamboats dock at.   
Kore boasted that he would swim around the pier and slid 
    away into the black water. 
At last the people were gone. The booths were long darkened.   
He waited for Kore at the other side of the pier, watching the   
    empty waves come in.   






[Passing the shop after school...]
 

Passing the shop after school, he would look up at the sign 
    and go on, glad that his own life had to do with books. 
Now at night when he saw the grey in his parents' hair and 
    heard their talk of that day's worries and the next: 
lack of orders, if orders, lack of workers, if workers, lack of 
    goods, if there were workers and goods, lack of orders 
    again,   
for the tenth time he said, "I'm going in with you: there's more 
    money in business. 
His father answered, "Since when do you care about money? 
    You don't know what kind of a life you're going into-- 
    but you have always had your own way. 

He went out selling: in the morning he read the Arrival of 
    Buyers in The Times; he packed half a dozen samples into 
    a box and went from office to office. 
Others like himself, sometimes a crowd, were waiting to thrust 
    their cards through a partition opening. 

When he ate, vexations were forgotten for a while. A quarter 
    past eleven was the time to go down the steps to Holz's 
    lunch counter.   
He would mount one of the stools. The food, steaming 
    fragrance, just brought from the kitchen, would be 
    dumped into the trays of the steam-table. 
Hamburger steak, mashed potatoes, onions and gravy, or a 
    knackwurst and sauerkraut; after that, a pudding with a 
    square of sugar and butter sliding from the top and red 
    fruit juice dripping over the saucer. 
He was growing fat.





A Son with a Future
 

When he was four years old, he stood at the window during a 
    thunderstorm. His father, a tailor, sat on the table sewing. 
    He came up to his father and said, "I know what makes 
    thunder: two clouds knock together. 
When he was older, he recited well-known rants at parties. 
    They all said that he would be a lawyer. 
At law school he won a prize for an essay. Afterwards, he 
    became the chum of an only son of rich people. They   
    were said to think the world of the young lawyer.   
The Appellate Division considered the matter of his disbarment. 
    His relatives heard rumours of embezzlement. 

When a boy, to keep himself at school, he had worked in a   
    drug store. 
Now he turned to this half-forgotten work, among perfumes 
    and pungent drugs, quiet after the hubble-bubble of the 
    courts and the search in law books. 
He had just enough money to buy a drug store in a side 
    street. 
Influenza broke out. The old tailor was still keeping his shop 
    and sitting cross-legged on the table sewing, but he was 
    half-blind. 
He, too, was taken sick. As he lay in bed he thought, "What a 
    lot of money doctors and druggists must be making; now 
    is my son's chance. 
They did not tell him that his son was dead of influenza.





A Deserter
 

Their new landlord was a handsome man. On his rounds to 
    collect rent she became friendly. 
Finally, she asked him in to have a cup of tea. After that he 
    came often. 

Once his mouth jerked, and turning, she saw her husband in 
    the doorway.   
She thought, One of the neighbors must have told him. 
She smiled and opened her mouth to speak, but could say 
    nothing. 
Her husband stood looking at the floor. He turned and went 
    away. 

She lay awake all night waiting for him. 
In the morning she went to his store. It was closed. 
She sent for his brothers and told them he had not been home. 
    They went to the police. Hospitals and morgues were 
    searched. For weeks they were called to identify drowned 
    men. 

His business had been prosperous; bank account and all were 
    untouched. She and their baby girl were provided for. 
In a few years they heard of him. He was dead. 
He had been making a poor living in a far off city. One day he 
    stepped in front of a street-car and was killed. 

She married again. Her daughter married and had children. 
    She named none after her father.





[His father carved umbrella handles...]
 

His father carved umbrella handles, but when umbrella   
    handles were made by machinery, there was only one 
    man for whom his father could work. 
The pay was small, though it had once been a good trade. 
They lived in the poorest part of the ghetto, near the lots 
    where people dump ashes. 
His father was anxious that his son should stay at school and 
    get out of the mess he himself was in. "Learning is the 
    best merchandise, he would say. 
His father died; there was his mother to be taken care of. He 
    taught in a school in the ghetto. 
Some pupils came at nine and stayed until three; others came 
    after public school and stayed until evening; most of the 
    pupils came in the evening. 
The courses were crammed, lasting a few months, pupils and 
    teachers anxious to be rid of the matter as soon as   
    possible. 
So he worked day and night, week-days and Sunday. 

His mother was dead. It was cold in the street and windy. A 
    dry snow had fallen and the feet of the walkers were 
    turning it into brown sand. 
He was forty. 
Now he was free. To do what? He knew no one whom he 
    cared to marry. And who would go into his poverty? 
If he were to give up this work he knew so well, to what else 
    could he turn? 
He would just keep on. He had lost this world and knew there   
    was no other.





The English in Virginia, April 1607
 

They landed and could 
    see nothing but 
    meadows and tall 
    trees-- 
cypress, nearly three 
    fathoms about at the 
    roots, 
rising straight for 
    sixty or eighty feet 
    without a branch. 
In the woods were 
    cedars, oaks, and 
    walnut trees; 
some beech, some elm, 
    black walnut, ash, 
    and sassafras; mul- 
    berry trees in 
    groves; 
honey-suckle and 
    other vines hanging   
    in clusters on 
    many trees. 
They stepped on 
    violets and other 
    sweet flowers, 
many kinds in many 
    colors; straw- 
    berries and rasp- 
    berries were on 
    the ground. 
Blackbirds with red 
    shoulders were 
    flying about 
and many small birds, 
    some red, some blue; 
the woods were full of deer; 
and running 
    everywhere 
    fresh water-- 
    brooks, rundles, 
    springs and creeks. 
In the twilight, 
    through the thickets 
    and tall grass, 
creeping upon all 
    fours--the 
    savages, their 
    bows in their 
    mouths.





Spain: Anno 1492
 

Torquemada. Now that Castile and Aragon in holy wedlock 
are Spain, 
and the last city of the Moors in Spain is Spanish 
except for Moor and Jew-- 
about every crucifix in every market-place 
and in the court itself the Jews!-- 
as seven centuries of Christian valor, Christian piety 
triumph 
stay not your hand; 
Spain of the knights, 
one in fealty to your majesties, 
become one in faith, 
Spain of the saints! 
Like the sun, 
rising as our Savior from His tomb into the brilliant sky 
blaze 
until the clouds that still obscure the light 
are drawn into His brightness 
and earth is brilliant as the sky is bright. 
Spain newly united 
still divided-- 
as the season of cold is the season of darkness 
in the spring of our rejoicing that the Moor is gone from Spain, 
the Jew go too! 
But if the Spaniard speaks, 
I speak no less a Christian: 
throw away the curse, you Jews, 
of fifteen hundred years; 
stay and prosper 
and Church and Heaven prosper, 
in our nets a goodly catch. 
Think not that we want aught of you 
but your souls; 
your money and your jewels-- 
all your trash-- 
keep if you stay and are Christian, 
take if you are Jews and go; 
we ask of you nothing but your Judaism 
which has brought you so much misery 
and will bring each of you-- 
the youngest and the gentlest-- 
to the flames of Hell 
and the worm that dies not. 
We give you, 
miserable sinners, 
the waters of 
Paradise; 
we give you the blessings of the saints, 
the blessings of Mary, the blessed mother of Christ, 
and the blessings of our Lord Jesus. 
   Isabella. There is a sweet reasonableness in the words of our 
      prior; 
it is Saint Dominic who speaks to us 
through his Dominican or Saint James himself.   
   Abrabanel. No noble in your court, your majesties, 
proud of his forefather, conquering Goth or Visigoth or Vandal, 
is of an older Spanish line than we-- 
Jews in Iberia before the Romans came. 
No noble boasting his service 
boasts of more than that Jew who through a thousand shoals 
   and reefs 
piloted Aragon to Castile--your marriage and Spain's glory. 
The rest of us, many tens of thousands,   
serve you humbly 
in smithy, field or vineyard, soldiers or physicians, 
as we have served in Spain two thousand years, 
Spaniards, true to your majesties 
as we are to the God of Israel--and of Spain, 
unlike the others only in our faith 
for which, if we must answer, 
we shall answer to our God. 
   Torquemada. Since all we do, 
and each word spoken, if only in our hearts, 
must be in worship-- 
not a leaf falls slowly but in His service-- 
to be unlike us in our faith 
is to be unlike in everything.   
True, you Jews must answer to your God, 
and in the flames and burning ice of Hell forever 
you shall answer; 
but we too, priests, bishops, queen and king, 
must answer for you: 
farmer or captain answers; 
shall we be less answerable for souls? 
   Abrabanel. You do not honor your God 
by bringing Him captives, 
like a mere emperor 
who must have retainers and retinue, 
serfs and forced labor; 
the loadstone   
without visible motion 
draws to itself every particle of iron; 
the sword--even though a winged angel swings it-- 
served only   
to drive Adam from his paradise. 
Your fingers stiff with rings and jewels, 
you dishonor your faith, your majesties, by cruelty, 
give it whatever noble name you will 
as princes make a rogue knight or lord. 
Will thieves and pirates be gentler with us 
than your constables and soldiers?-- 
your majesties will hear of many 
ripped up for the jewels it will be said they swallowed; 
many left by sailors to die on reefs and sandbars 
for a smock or a pair of hose; many dead of plague 
or found like birds in winter 
dead in the fields about towns or like fish upon a beach; 
many will die as slaves at work 
beasts would be fitter for but costlier, 
who have written a page of Castilian 
or handled a Toledo blade with the best. 
And yet the weak has each his strength, 
Spain of Spaniard, Basque, and Catalonian, Moor and Gypsy, 
else all beasts were tigers,   
all fish sharks, 
and only giants left; 
the stricken remember-- 
as wounds and scars last longer than the blow-- 
and if drops of water wear channels in the rock 
on which the earth itself is, 
in the action of centuries 
how powerful are tears. 
Would you have our religion 
like our clothes--for comfort and the eyes of men, 
put off at night, 
and we left lying naked in the darkness? 
The body is like roots stretching down into the earth-- 
forcing still a way over stones and under rock, through sand, 
sucking nourishment in darkness, 
bearing the tread of man and beast, 
and of the earth forever; 
but the spirit-- 
twigs and leaves 
spreading   
through sunshine 
or the luminous darkness 
of twilight, evening, night, and dawn, 
moving 
in every wind of heaven 
and turning 
to whatever corner of the sky is brightest, 
compelled by nothing stronger than the light; 
the body is like earth, 
the spirit like water 
without which earth is sand 
and which must be free or stagnant; 
or if the body is as water, 
the spirit is like air 
that must have doors and windows   
or else is stuffy and unbreathable-- 
or like the fire 
of which sun and stars have been compounded, 
which Joshua could command but for an hour. 
   Isabella. If our eye offends us, 
pluck it out! 
Even so, we will sweep away the Jews 
from every town and hamlet, field and corner of our dominion, 
though they are the sands for number. 
Go and begone--but stay as Christians; 
come and be dear to us, 
as the Prodigal! 
   Abrabanel. We Jews have been accused of love of wealth, 
but not for all our wealth in Spain, 
fields and vineyards, houses of timber and houses of stone 
that we must leave, 
and all the wealth that will be stolen from us,   
will we stay; 
we Jews have been accused of arrogance, 
but not for all the dignities that we must leave, 
our offices and honors 
in this, the proudest court of Christendom, 
will we stay; 
we Jews have been accused of love of life, 
delighting in the flesh, 
but though we shall die along a thousand roads 
we will not stay-- 
striking roots 
somewhere 
to flourish 
as we flourished, 
giving shade and fruit. 







Depression
 

So proudly she came into the subway car 
all who were not reading their newspapers saw 
the head high and the slow tread-- 
coat wrinkled and her belongings in a paper bag, 
face unwashed and the grey hair uncombed; 

simple soul, who so early in the morning when only the 
    poorest go to work, 
stood up in the subway and outshouting the noise: 
"Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, I have a baby at home who 
    is sick, 
and I have no money, no job; who did not have box or cap 
    to take coins-- 
only his hands, 
and, seeing only faces turned away, 
did not even go down the aisle as beggars do; 

the fire had burnt through the floor: 
machines and merchandise had fallen into   
the great hole, this zero that had sucked away so many years 
and now, seen at last, the shop itself; 
the ceiling sloped until it almost touched the floor-- 
    a strange curve 
in the lines and oblongs of his life; 
drops were falling   
from the naked beams of the floor above, 
from the soaked plaster, still the ceiling; 
drops of dirty water were falling 
on his clothes and hat and on his hands; 
the thoughts of business 
gathered in his bosom like black water 
in footsteps through a swamp; 

waiting for a job, she studied the dusty table at which she sat 
and the floor which had been badly swept-- 
the office-boy had left the corners dirty; 
a mouse ran in and out under the radiator 
and she drew her feet away 
and her skirt about her legs, but the mouse went in and out 
about its business; and she sat waiting for a job 
in an unfriendly world of men and mice; 

walking along the drive by twos and threes, 
talking about jobs, 
jobs they might get and jobs they had had, 
never turning to look at the trees or the river 
glistening in the sunlight or the automobiles 
that went swiftly past them-- 
in twos and threes talking about jobs; 

in the drizzle 
four in a row 
close to the curb 
that passers-by might pass, 
the squads stand 
waiting for soup, 
a slice of bread 
and shelter-- 
grimy clothes 
their uniform; 
on a stoop 
stiffly across the steps 
a man 
who has fainted; 
each in that battalion 
eyes him, 
but does not move from his place, 
well drilled in want.





New Nation
 

I   
Land of Refuge 

A mountain of white ice 
standing still 
in the water 
here forty fathoms deep 
and flowing swiftly 
from the north; 
grampuses and whales 
going by in companies, 
spouting up water in streams 
(these wonders of the Lord, I, Francis Higginson, 
saw on the way to Salem); 
a fair morning, 
and still many leagues from land, 
but the air warm and spiced-- 
yellow flowers on the sea, 
sometimes singly,   
sometimes in sheets; 
high trees on every hill and in every dale, 
on every island, 
and even on the stony cliffs; 
banks of earth 
on which are groves of trees, 
and no undergrowth of bush or brambles; 
the sandy shore overrun with vines 
of melons and of grapes 
which the beat and surging of the sea 
overflows 
(this I, Arthur Barlowe, saw); 
trees of sweet-smelling wood 
with rind and leaves sweet-smelling 
as the bark of cinnamon and leaves of bay; 
soil dark and soft, 
strawberries everywhere, 
hickory nuts and sassafras; 
here are grapes white and red, 
very sweet and strong, 
and plums, black and red, 
and single roses, white and red and damask; 
we have eaten venison with the Indians, 
and drunk water with spice in it-- 
Indian corn, even the coarsest, 
makes as pleasant a meat as rice. 
(Without any show of anger 
the Iroquois crunched our fingers in their mouths, 
and with their teeth tore off the nails; 
then hacked our fingers off, joint by joint, 
with stone hatchets, or with a shell too dull 
to cut the sinews; 
and in the stumps of our thumbs drove up spikes 
until the elbow; 
but so great the help of Jesus, 
with this maimed hand I, Isaac Jogues, 
Jesuit and priest, 
baptised an Indian among the captives, 
using the raindrops on a long leaf of corn.) 

Let others cry, "New lands! 
where Indians shall bring 
kernels of gold, wagons full of gold; 
whatever spills upon the way 
we shall tread carelessly, 
for we shall have so much of gold-- 
so many pearls to sew upon our clothes; 
away, 
unthrifty gentlemen, 
to the forests of Virginia! 
There are lands 
to feed all the poor of England, 
trees 
to build each a home; 
give us but axes, shovels, and ploughshares, 
and away then to America, 
all you poor! 
In England a watch is set about us 
and we are clapt in jails, 
and Holland is a dear place, 
for there they live by trading-- 
but we are a plain country people 
whose trade is husbandry, 
and we would worship God as simply as the shepherds 
and Galilean fishermen, 
live as plainly; 
away, 
dissenters, 
to New England! 
A great wind is blowing, 
heavy rain-- 
thick darkness; 
the sailors running here and there, 
shouting at one another 
to pull at this and at that rope, 
and the waves pouring over the ship; 
landing in the rain-- 
the cold rain 
falling steadily; 
the ground wet, 
all the leaves dripping, 
and the rocks running with water; 
the sky is cloud on cloud 
in which the brief sun barely shines, 
the ground snow on snow, 
the cold air 
wind and blast; 
we have followed our God 
into this wilderness 
of trees heavy with snow, 
rocks seamed with ice, 
that in the freezing blasts 
the remnant of this remnant 
kindle so bright, so lasting a fire 
on this continent, 
prisoners of ice and darkness everywhere 
will turn and come to it 
to warm their hands and hearts. 

II 
Brief History 

Glaciers pushing so far and surely 
thaw and withdraw; 
even the deep, 
while the explosion of its waves 
dynamites the cliffs, 
leaves new lands, 
new groves and habitations 
beside the glittering currents flowing quickly 
into the silver waters of the sun. 

Here are men who find 
a comfortable bed 
among the rocks, 
who wrap themselves 
in their coats 
to sleep upon the ground 
while their horse feeds in the grass beside the lake; 
who catch trout in the brook 
and roast them on the ashes; 
eat the flesh 
of bear for meat, the white meat of turkeys 
for their bread, and whose salt is brought 
in an iron pot across the mountains; 
who live 
where two hundred acres may be had 
for a calf and a wool hat; 
or walk where there is no road 
nor any man, except the savage. 

All the bells of Boston 
are tolling 
a solemn peal; 
the market men will take no more paper money-- 
hard money only;   
soldiers with bare feet showing through their shoes 
in the snow, the smoke of the camp-fires blowing into their 
    eyes; 
for food a bowl of beef soup full of burnt leaves; 
no house or hut, and even the sick in tents. 
The rays of your light, 
like the sun's, Republic of France, 
shone first in the west; the eater shall give meat, 
and out of the strong sweetness-- 
out of the bones of the French monarchy 
the honey of freedom; 
the bells of Philadelphia are ringing 
as if for a fire, 
and the crowds, 
shouting and hallooing, 
fill the streets; 
ring, bells, throughout the night, 
let no one sleep; 
ring, clash, and peal 
until the log cabins and cottages of cedar shingles, 
the houses of grey stone or of brick, 
tremble, 
and the listeners 
feel in their flesh 
the vibrations of your metal voices 
ringing,   
Proclaim liberty, 
proclaim liberty throughout the land! 

Wrongs,   
like molecules of gas that seep into a house,   
explode 
in particles of fire! 
A captain gallops down the street, 
wheels, 
and the hoof of his horse 
sends the pie plates shining in the sun, 
his horse stops 
at what is 
flowing from the battlefield, 
sniffs at it, and will not cross; 
this is not water-- 
it is blood 
in a thick and ropy stream. 
(The dying Negress says, 
I cannot eat dry hominy: 
I lived in Massa's house, 
and used to have white bread and coffee; 
and I want something sweet in my mouth.) 
On the lawn the Negroes dance 
and clap their hands, 
So glad! so glad! 
Bless the Lord for freedom! 
So glad! so glad! 

Do not mourn the dandelions-- 
that their golden heads become grey 
in no time at all 
and are blown about in the wind; 
each season shall bring them again to the lawns; 
but how long the seeds of justice 
stay underground, 
how much blood and ashes of precious things 
to manure so rare and brief a growth. 

Currents of waste 
wind 
along the river 
between the factories-- 
the colonnades 
and sacred groves 
of chimneys; 
where once the road 
in ruts and ridges--lines of rails 
hold to a gleaming purpose, 
come wind, come rain, come winter or the night; 
build storey on storey out of glass; 
light electric lights,   
row after row, whose shining wires 
will not flicker in the wind; 
let the streets sound 
with the horns and hosannahs of motor cars! 
Man, you need no longer 
drudge at plow or oar, no longer trudge; 
proclaim this liberty to all! 
If bread may be as plentiful,   
shall we not share it 
as we share water?





Autobiography: New York
 

I 

It is not to be bought for a penny 
in the candy store, nor picked 
from the bushes in the park. It may be found, perhaps, 
in the ashes on the distant lots, 
among the rusting cans and Jimpson weeds. 
If you wish to eat fish freely, 
cucumbers and melons, 
you should have stayed in Egypt. 

II 

I am alone-- 
and glad to be alone; 
I do not like people who walk about 
so late; who walk slowly after midnight 
through the leaves fallen on the sidewalks. 
I do not like 
my own face 
in the little mirrors of the slot-machines 
before the closed stores. 

III 

Walking along the highway, 
I smell the yellow flowers of a shrub, 
watch the starlings on a lawn, perhaps-- 
but why are all these   
speeding away in automobiles, 
where are they off to 
in such a hurry? 
They must be going to hear wise men 
and to look at beautiful women,   
and I am just a fool 
to be loitering here alone. 

IV 

I like the sound of the street-- 
but I, apart and alone, 
beside an open window 
and behind a closed door. 

V 

Winter is here indeed; the leaves have long been swept 
from the winding walks; trees and ground are brown-- 
all is in order. 
Only the lamps now flourish in the park. 
We walk about and talk; 
but the troubles of the unsuccessful middle-aged 
are so uninteresting! 

VI 

Now it is cold: where the snow was melting 
the walk crackles with black ice beneath my careful steps; 
and the snow is old and pitted, 
here grey with ashes and there yellow with sand. 
The walks lie in the cold shadow 
of houses; 
pigeons and sparrows are in a hollow 
for cold, out of the wind; but here,   
where the sunshine pours through a narrow street 
upon a little tree, black and naked of every leaf, 
the sparrows are in the sun, thick upon the twigs. 
Those who in their lives braved the anger of their fellows, 
bronze statues now, 
with outstretched arm or sword 
brave only the weather. 

I find myself talking aloud 
as I walk; 
that is bad. 
Only Don Juan would believe 
I am in conversation with the 
snow-covered statues; 
only St. Francis   
that I am talking to the sparrows 
in the naked bushes,   
to the pigeons   
in the snow. 

VII 

The ropes in the wind   
slapping the flag-pole 
(the flag has been hauled down); 
behind the bare tree-tops 
the lights of an aeroplane 
moving away slowly. 

A star or two shining 
between factory chimneys; 
the street dark and still 
because the street-lamp has been broken 
and it is cold and late. 

VIII 

Bright upon the table 
for your birthday, 
the burning candles will dissolve   
in rays 
and lumps of wax. 
Unlike a skull, 
they say politely, 
This is you! 

IX 

I am afraid 
because of the foolishness 
I have spoken. 
I must diet 
on silence; 
strengthen myself 
with quiet. 

Where is the wisdom   
with which I may be medicined? 
I will walk by myself 
and cure myself 
in the sunshine and the wind. 

X 

I do not believe that David killed Goliath. 
It must have been-- 
you will find the name in the list of David's captains. 
But, whoever it was, he was no fool 
when he took off the helmet 
and put down the sword and the spear and the shield 
and said, The weapons you have given me are good, 
but they are not mine: 
I will fight in my own way 
with a couple of pebbles and a sling. 

XI 

"Shall I go there? "As you like-- 
it will not matter; you are not at all important. 
The words stuck to me   
like burrs. The path was hidden 
under the fallen leaves; and here and there 
the stream was choked. Where it forced a way 
the ripples flashed a second. 
She spoke unkindly but it was the truth: 
I shared the sunshine like a leaf, a ripple; 

thinking of this, sunned myself 
and, for the moment, was content. 

XII 

There is nobody in the street 
of those who crowded about David 
to watch me   
as I dance before the Lord: 
alone in my unimportance 
to do as I like. 

XIII 

Your angry words--each false name 
sinks into me, and is added to the heap 
beneath. I am still the same: 
they are no part of me, which I keep; 
but the way I go, and over which I flow. 

XIV 
The Bridge 

In a cloud bones of steel. 

XV 
God and Messenger 

This pavement barren 
as the mountain 
on which God spoke to Moses-- 
suddenly in the street 
shining against my legs 
the bumper of a motor car. 

XVI 

A beggar stretches out his hand 
to touch a fur collar, and strokes it unseen, 
stealing its warmth for his finger tips. 

XVII 

The elevator man, working long hours 
for little--whose work is dull and trivial-- 
must also greet each passenger 
pleasantly: 
to be so heroic 
he wears a uniform. 

XVIII 

This subway station   
with its electric lights, pillars of steel, arches of cement, and trains-- 
quite an improvement on the caves of the cave-men; 
but, look! on this wall 
a primitive drawing. 

XIX 
Subway 

People moving, people standing still, crowds 
and more crowds; a thousand and ten thousand iron girders 
as pillars; 
escape! 
But how, 
shut up in the moving train? 
And upstairs, in the street, 
the sun is shining as it shines in June. 

XX 
Poet with Whiskey Bottle and Sailor 

There is anguish there, certainly, 
and a commotion 
in the next room; 
shouts of 
words and phrases that do not make sentences 
and sentences that do not make sense. 
I open the door: 
ah, the hallway is crowded-- 
descendants of the three wise men,   
now male and female, 
come again to worship in a stable. 

XXI 

The white cat on the lawn, 
lying in the sun against the hedge, 
lovely to look at-- 
but this stout gentleman, 
who needs a shave badly,   
leaning in an arbor hung with purple grapes, 
purple grapes all about him, 
is unpleasant. 
Am I becoming misanthropic? 
An atheist? 
Why, this might be the god Bacchus! 

XXII 

The bearded rag-picker 
seated among heaps of rags in a basement 
sings: 
It was born that way; 
that is the way it was born-- 
the way it came out of some body 
to stink: 
nothing will change it-- 
neither pity nor kindness. 
A paralytic, 
hands trembling like water, 
listens. 

Behind her 
the sparrows cluster upon one tree 
and leave the others barren; 
and the town clock, 
that stern accountant, 
tells us it is six, 
and would persuade us that the night is spent. 

XXIII 
Cooper Union Library 

Men and women with open books before them-- 
and never turn a page: come 
merely for warmth   
not light. 

XXIV 

A row of tenements, windows boarded up; 
an empty factory, windows broken; 
a hillside of dead leaves, dead weeds, 
old newspapers and rusted cans. 
Now come a group   
in old clothes and broken shoes 
who say politely, 
The way, sir? If you don't mind 
tell us 
the way, please. 

XXV 

The young fellow walks about 
with nothing to do: he has lost his job. 
"If I ever get another, I'll be hard! 
You've got to be hard 
to get on. I'll be hard, all right, 
he says bitterly. Takes out his cigarettes. 
Only four or five left. 
Looks at me out of the corner of his eye-- 
a stranger he has just met; hesitates; 
and offers me a cigarette. 

XXVI 

I am always surprised to meet, after ten or twenty years, 
those who were poor and silly 
still poor and silly, of course, but alive-- 
in spite of wars and plagues and panics, 
alive and well. 
Is it possible 
there is a Father in Heaven, 
after all? 

XXVII 

On a Sunday, when the place was closed, 
I saw a plump mouse among the cakes in the window: 
dear ladies, 
who crowd this expensive tea-room, 
you must not think that you alone are blessed of God. 

XXVIII 

A fine fellow, trotting easily without a sound 
down the macadam road between the woods, 
you heard me, 
turned your pointed head, 
and we took a long look at each other, 
fox and man; 
then, without any hurry, you went into the ferns, 
and left the road to the automobiles and me-- 
to the heels and wheels of the citizens. 

XXIX 

The sun sunks 
through the grey heavens-- 
no brighter than the moon; 

from the tower 
in single notes 
the winter music of the bells. 

A stooping Negress walking slowly 
through the slowly falling snow. 

XXX 

In your warm room, 
do not judge by that line of clothes 
behind the wall of the warehouse-- 
in the sunshine; 
on other roofs 
other lines of clothes 
turn and twist; 
yes, a cold wind is blowing. 

The pigeons will not rise 
from their roof; 
fly to the coop, find the door closed, 
and huddle on top, 
facing east, away from the wind. 

XXXI 

The sky is cloudy 
but the clouds-- 
as the long day ends-- 
are pearl and rose; 
spring has come 
to the streets, 
spring has come to the sky. 

Sit still 
beside the open window 
and let the wind 
the gentle wind, 
blow in your face; 

sit still   
and fold your hands-- 
empty your heart of thoughts, 
your mind of dreams. 

XXXII 
Dawn in the Park 

The leaves are solid 
in the gloom; 
the ledges of rock 
in this new world are 
unsubstantial. 
The sole inhabitants, it seems, 
are birds-- 

until these two, 
his arm about her waist. 

XXXIII 

Stream that a month ago 
flowed between banks of snow 
and whose grey ripples showed 
a sky as grey-- 
now the stream is seen 
clear and as green 
as are the willows on its banks, 
for it is May: 
this stream was turbid, grey, 
that now is clear and green-- 
for it is May! 

Your hair be dyed and curled the more, 
your dress be gayer than before-- 
your beauty had its praise, 
your anxious eyes now ask it; 
but your face will soon be crumpled 
like a ball of paper tossed 
in the trash-basket, 
in the trash-basket.

Holding the stem of the 
beauty she had 
as if it were still   
a rose.

Going West 

The train leaves New York--leaves the tunnel: yesterday's snow 
in the corners of roofs, in the furrows of ploughed fields, 
under the shelter of the naked trees, 
on one side of roads and one bank of streams-- 
wherever the morning sun did not reach it; 
turbulent streams running in twenty parallel currents; 
slopes showing on top a dark band of naked woods. 
Bits of coal rain on the roof of the car, 
smoke from the engine is blown in front of the window, 
and on the flat land beside the rails 
the snow is blown about. 

Next morning, across the lots, blocks of brand-new houses; 
old wooden houses with back porches facing the tracks; 
the railway yard widens and the ground is evenly lined with rails, 
and we are in Chicago. 
The flat fields on either side covered with dried corn-stalks, 
broken a little above the ground and flat on the black earth; 
ice in the hollows; shaggy horses 
trot away from the train; a colt with lifted hoof 
looks at us; towers of steel girders, in an endless row, 
carry wires on three pairs of arms across the fields. A beam to 
    guide planes 
flashing in the night. 

At last only the morning star is shining; 
the plain is covered with sparse yellow grass; 
a great herd of cattle--red cattle with white faces and legs-- 
    grazing. 
Hills with flat tops; snow in the hollows on the steep sides; 
a cement bridge with a bright new railing; 
reddish ground; above a ridge of hills 
black mountains, sheets of snow on their sides, black mountains 
    veined with snow. 
Low rolling hills covered with sage; neither house nor cattle. By 
    nightfall it is snowing. 

The dark ground is flat to the river--bright with dawn; 
beyond rise the mountains blue and purple; 
the blue of the sky becomes purple, in which a star is shining. 
The desert is white with snow, the sage heaped with it; 
the mountains to the north are white. The train turns 
south. We are among rocks; 
grey rock and red rock; yellow rock and red rock; 
cliffs bare of any growth; walls of red rock crumbling; 
a mountain covered with boulders, rocks, and stones; 
and not a living thing 
except a large bird 
slowly flying. 

The ground beside the roadbed is green with bright grass; 
the trees along the muddy river are bright with buds; 
trees in the hollow have budded and are green with leaves. 
Palms in the streets of a town. 
Purple and white flowers on the desert. 
White sand in smooth waves. 
A gravel plain like rippling water. 
Single lights; many lights; lights along highways, lights along streets, 
and along the streets of Los Angeles.





The Great Figure
 

Among the rain 
and lights 
I saw the figure 5 
in gold 
on a red 
firetruck 
moving 
tense 
unheeded 
to gong clangs 
siren howls 
and wheels rumbling 
through the dark city. 






Pagani's, November 8
 

Suddenly discovering in the eyes of the very beautiful 
                            Normande cocotte 
The eyes of the very learned British Museum assistant.





from War is Kind ["I explain the silvered passing of a ship at night]
 

I explain the silvered passing of a ship at night 
The sweep of each sad lost wave 
The dwindling boom of the steel thing's striving 
The little cry of a man to a man 
A shadow falling across the greyer night 
And the sinking of the small star. 

Then the waste, the far waste of waters 
And the soft lashing of black waves 
For long and in loneliness. 

Remember, thou, oh ship of love 
Thou leavest a far waste of waters 
And the soft lashing of black waves 
For long and in loneliness.






Song of the Thunders
 

Sometimes I, 
I go about pitying   
Myself 
While I am carried by the wind 
Across the sky.





Spring Song
 

As my eyes search the prairie 
I feel the summer in the spring.





["The lamps are burning in the synagogue..."]
 

"The lamps are burning in the synagogue, 
in the houses of study, in dark alleys. . . 
This should be the place. 
This is the way 
the guide-book describes it. Excuse me, sir, 
can you tell me 
where Eli lives, Eli the katzev-- 
slaughterer of cattle and poultry? 
One of my ancestors. 
Reb Haskel? Reb Shimin? My grandfathers. 

This is the discipline that withstood the siege 
of every Jew; 
these are the prayer-shawls that have proved 
stronger than armor. 

Let us begin then humbly. Not by asking: 
Who is This you pray to? Name Him; 
define Him. For the answer is: 
we do not name Him. 
Once out of a savage fear, perhaps; 
now out of knowledge--of our ignorance. 

Begin then humbly. Not by asking: 
shall I live forever? 
Hear again the dear dead greeting me gladly 
as they used to 
when we were all among the living? 
For the answer is: 
if you think we differ from all His other creatures, 
say only if you like with the Pharisees, our teachers, 
those who do not believe in an eternal life 
will not have it. 

In the morning I arise and match again 
my plans against my cash. 
I wonder now if the long morning-prayers 
were an utter waste of an hour 
weighing, as they do, hopes and anguish, 
and sending the believer out into the street   
with the sweet taste of the prayers on his lips. 

How good to stop   
and look out upon eternity a while; 
and daily   
in the morning, afternoon, and evening 
be at ease in Zion. 







Night-Piece
 

I saw within the shadows of the yard the shed 
and saw the snow upon its roof-- 
an oblong glowing in the moonlit night. 

I could not rest or close my eyes, 
although I knew that I must rise 
early next morning and begin my work again, 
and begin my work again. 

That day was lost--that month as well; 
and year and year for all that I can tell.





[Leaving the beach on a Sunday in a streetcar]
 

Leaving the beach on a Sunday in a streetcar 
a family of three--mother, son and daughter: 
the mother, well on in the thirties, blond hair, worried face; 
the son, twelve years of age or so, seated opposite, 
and the daughter, about eight or nine, beside her. 
The boy was blond, too; a good-looking little fellow 
with dreamy eyes. The little girl was quite plain; 
mouth pulled down at the corners, 
sharp angry eyes behind eyeglasses. 

No sooner were they seated than the boy, speaking gently, said, 
"Today was one of the most wonderful days I ever had. 
The girl said shrilly, "I wish we could live in one of those houses-- 
looking at the bungalows along the shore-- 
"then we could go to the beach every day. 
The mother did not answer either. 
The beach they were coming from was crowded with poor people; 
and the family was dressed cheaply but was neat and spotless, 
even after the day's outing. 
I wondered idly where the father was: at work? dead? divorced? 

After a while the mother said, weighing her words, 
"You know Mister. . . 
I did not hear the name: it was spoken so softly. 
She was talking to the boy. 
"He goes fishing every Wednesday. 
I think I can get him to take you along. 
The boy did not answer for a minute or two 
and then said, in his gentle voice, 
"I should like it very much. 
"Can I go too? asked the little girl shrilly, 
but no one answered her. 

Mother and son had eyes only for each other. 
She took out her handkerchief and wiped his face. 
He complained of something in his eye-- 
certainly not enough to make him blink-- 
and she raised the upper lid 
and lowered the lower lid to look for it. 

The little girl stood up to look out of the window   
and the boy said to his mother, "She stepped on my toes 
and did not even say, Excuse me, please. 
The mother turned to the little girl and said sharply, 
"Why didn't you say, Excuse me? 
You should have said, Excuse me, brother. 
The little girl said nothing, 
face turned toward the window, 
the corners of her mouth far down and her eyes,   
bright and dry, looking sharply through her glasses.





[I saw him walking along slowly at night]
 

I saw him walking along slowly at night 
holding a tray of candy and chewing-gum: 
a Jewish boy of fifteen or sixteen 
with large black eyes and a gentle face. 
He sidled into a saloon 
and must have been ordered away 
because he came out promptly 
through the swinging doors. 

I wondered what he was doing 
far from a Jewish neighborhood. 
(I knew the side streets 
and the roughs standing about on the corners and stoops.) 
What a prize this shambling boy with his tray! 
I stepped up to warn him 
against leaving the brightly-lit avenue. 
He listened, eyed me steadily, and walked on calmly. 
I looked at him in astonishment 
and thought: has nothing frightened you? 

Neither the capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, by the 
    Romans, by the Crusaders? 
No pogrom in Russia; 
no Nazi death-camp in Germany? 
How can you still go about so calmly?





[The house in which we now lived was old]
 

The house in which we now lived was old-- 
dark rooms and low ceilings. 
Once our maid, who happened to be Hungarian, 
reached her hand up into the cupboard for a dish 
and touched a dead rat 
that had crawled there to die--poisoned, no doubt. 
"Disgusting, disgusting, she kept saying in German 
and, to my amusement, shuddered whenever she thought of it. 
(A pretty blonde, 
too slight to do the housework she had to, 
she had come, unlike the Ukrainian peasant girls that generally 
    worked for us, 
from a town instead of a village.) 

My parents' place of business was so near 
my mother could come home whenever she felt like it 
to see how things were going, but she came seldom 
for there was always something to do in the shop 
that would not wait. I was all of thirteen 
and saw no need for any uneasiness on her part. 
But it was not wholly unwarranted by that neighborhood: 
we were only a block and a half from the Bowery, 
where the cheapest lodging-houses, saloons, and eating-places 
    were 
and where the men who did the humblest work lived; 
these were aristocrats, no doubt, 
among the crowd out of work 
and the riffraff who stood idly in doorways 
and about the pillars of the railway overhead and shuffled 
    along the sidewalk. 

Once there was a gentle knock at the door.   
Just back from school, I opened it 
and a man, so tall he stooped as he stood in the doorway-- 
his shoulders filled it-- 
put his foot across the threshold. 
I could not close the door--and did not try to-- 
but waited for him to speak or move. 
He was silent, his small eyes shining, 
and he peered about, 
hesitating and thinking what to do next. 
The pretty maid had just put a plate of borsht-- 
which my mother had taught her how to make-- 
on the table. She moaned 
and rushed to the front room, 
although she could not get out of the flat that way, 
for the front door was locked and my mother had the key. 
But perhaps she felt safer near the windows that opened on the 
    street, 
three stories below, 
and she was out of the visitor's sight. 
"What do you want? I asked. 
The stranger--I took him for a Russian peasant, 
since there were some in the neighborhood-- 
did not answer, 
but there was such unhappiness in his drawn face 
that I felt friendly and unafraid. 
"Will you have something to eat? I asked cheerfully 
and pointed to the chair I had been about to take. 
We both looked at the table and saw, 
beside the plate of borsht and a round loaf of black bread, 
the long bread knife. 
Without a word, the man seated himself clumsily 
and I cut him a thick slab of bread 
and then another. After a moment's hesitation, 
I left the knife beside the bread to show that I was not afraid. 
The man ate steadily and I stood to one side like a waiter. 
I filled the plate once more with borsht, 
and dumped in plenty of cabbage and potatoes 
from the bottom of the pot. As soon as he was through 
and his plate empty again, he got up, 
glanced at me for a second out of his narrow eyes, 
then bowed his head slightly   
and warily, softly, without a word, 
edged out of the door. 
I closed it after him just as quietly, 
and silently turned the big brass key in the lock. 
I went into the front room to find the maid: 
she was on her knees, 
muttering her prayers as fast as she could, 
and stood up, embarrassed, 
as I looked at her and smiled. 







[The bread has become moldy]
 

The bread has become moldy 
and the dates blown down by the wind; 
the iron has slipped from the helve. 
The wool was to by dyed red 
but the dyer dyed it black. 

The dead woman has forgotten her comb 
and tube of eye-paint; 
the dead cobbler has forgotten his knife, 
the dead butcher his chopper, 
and the dead carpenter his adze. 

A goat can be driven off with a shout. 
But where is the man to shout? 
The bricks pile up, the laths are trimmed, 
and the beams are ready. Where is the builder? 

To be buried in a linen shroud 
or in a matting of reeds-- 
but where are the dead of the Flood 
and where the dead of Nebuchadnezzar?





Deerfield:1703
 

Before the break of day the minister was awakened 
by the sound of hatchets 
breaking open the door and windows. 
He ran towards the door: 
about twenty Indians with painted faces 
were coming into the house 
howling. 

Three Indians took hold of him, 
and bound him as he stood in his night-shirt, 
and began to rifle the house going into every room. 
As he lay, bound and helpless, he thought of his wife and 
    children-- 
his wife had given birth only a few weeks before-- 
and he remembered the passage in Isaiah: 
"I shall go to the gates of the grave 
deprived of the rest of my years. . . 

The Indians had taken two of his children to the door 
and killed them, 
as well as the Negro woman 
who helped take care of them; 
keeping him bound with the cord about one arm, 
they let him put on his clothes with the other; 
and let his wife dress herself, too, 
as well as their children left alive. 

When the sun was an hour high 
all were led out of the house 
for the journey of three hundred miles to Quebec-- 
snow up to their knees. 
Many of the houses were now on fire; 
and, as they left the town, 
he saw his house and barn burning. 

At first the minister was not allowed to speak to any of his 
    fellow captives 
as they marched, 
but on the second day he had another Indian to watch him 
and was allowed to speak with his wife when he overtook her 
and could walk with her and help her along. 
She told him that she was losing her strength 
and they must expect to part 
and she hoped that God would keep him alive and their children 
    still among the living-- 
but not a word of complaint 
saying that it was the will of God. 

When they came to a small river 
the captives had to wade it; 
the water knee-deep 
and the current swift. 
After that they had to climb a hill, 
almost a mountain, 
and the minister's strength was almost gone when he came to   
    the top; 
but he was not allowed to sit down 
and even unburdened of his pack. 

He begged the Indian in charge of him 
to let him go down and help his wife 
but the man would not let him; 
and he asked each of the captives as they passed 
about her; 
and heard at last that in going through the river 
she fell 
and plunged headfirst into the water; 
and, after that, at the foot of the hill 
the Indian who held her captive 
killed her 
with one stroke of his hatchet 
and left the body   
as meat for the fowls and beasts.





Slave Sale: New Orleans
 

To begin with, the slaves had to wash themselves well, 
and the men who had beards had to shave them off; 
the men were then given a new suit each, 
cheap but clean, and a hat, shirt, and shoes; 
and the women were each given a frock of calico 
and a handkerchief to tie about their heads. 
They were then led by the man selling them into a large room; 
the men placed on one side, the women at the other; 
the tallest at the head of each row 
and then the next in size 
and so on to the shortest. 

Many called to look at the slaves for sale 
and the seller kept talking about their qualities; 
made them hold up their heads and walk about briskly; 
and those who might buy had them open their mouths 
to look at their teeth, 
and felt their arms and bodies, 
just as they might a horse for sale; 
and asked each what they could do. 
Sometimes a man or woman would be taken to a small house 
    in the yard, 
to be stripped and looked at carefully: 
if they had the scars of whips on their backs 
that would show they had been troublesome. 

During the day a number of sales were made; 
and a planter from Baton Rouge bought Eliza's little son. 
Before that the boy had to jump and run across the floor 
to show his activity. 
But all the time the trade was going on,   
his mother was crying and wringing her hands 
and kept begging the man who was thinking of buying the boy 
not to buy him unless he bought her, too, 
and her little daughter: 
and Eliza kept saying that if he did she would be "the most 
    faithful slave that ever lived. 
But the man from Baton Rouge said he could not afford to 
    buy her, 
and then she began to cry aloud in her grief. 

The man selling the slaves turned on her, his whip lifted, 
and told her to stop her noise: 
if she would not stop her "sniveling 
he would take her into the yard 
and give her a hundred lashes. 
She tried to wipe away her tears 
but could not 
and said she wanted to be with her children 
and kept begging the man selling the slaves and the man from   
    Baton Rouge-- 
who by that time had bought her son-- 
not to separate the three of them, mother, son, and daughter; 
and over and over again kept saying how faithful and obedient 
    she would be 
and how hard she would work day and night. 

But the man from Baton Rouge 
said again he could not buy mother and son, let alone the three, 
and that only the boy must go with him. 
Then Eliza ran to her son, hugged him and kissed him 
again and again 
and her tears kept falling on his face. 
The man selling the slaves kept cursing her 
and called her a blubbering, howling wench 
and ordered her back to her place in line 
and to behave herself 
or he would give her something really to cry about.





Beer
 

Here, 
    With my beer 
I sit, 
While golden moments flit: 
    Alas! 
    They pass 
Unheeded by: 
And, as they fly, 
I, 
Being dry, 
    Sit, idly sipping here 
    My beer. 

O, finer far 
Than fame, or riches, are 
The graceful smoke-wreaths of this free cigar! 
    Why 
    Should I 
    Weep, wail, or sigh? 
    What if luck has passed me by? 
What if my hopes are dead,--  
My pleasures fled? 
    Have I not still 
    My fill 
Of right good cheer,-- 
Cigars and beer? 

    Go, whining youth, 
    Forsooth! 
Go, weep and wail, 
Sigh and grow pale, 
    Weave melancholy rhymes 
    On the old times, 
Whose joys like shadowy ghosts appear,--
But leave me to my beer! 
    Gold is dross,-- 
    Love is loss,--
So, if I gulp my sorrows down, 
Or see them drown 
In foamy draughts of old nut-brown, 
Then do I wear the crown, 
    Without the cross!






Expression
 

A hackneyed burden, to a hackneyed air,-- 
"I love thee only,--thou art wondrous fair! 
Alas! the poets have worn the theme threadbare! 

Can I not find some words less tame and old, 
To paint thy form and face of perfect mould, 
Thy dewy lips, thy hair of brown and gold? 

Can I not sing in somewhat fresher strain 
The love I lavish and receive again,-- 
The thrilling joy, so like to thrilling pain? 

Can I not, by some metaphor divine, 
Describe the life I quaff like nectared wine 
In being thine, and knowing thou art mine? 

Ah, no! this halting verse can naught express; 
No English words can half the truth confess, 
That have not all been rhymed to weariness! 

So let me cease my scribbling for to-day, 
And maiden, turn thy lovely face this way,--
Words will not do, but haply kisses may!






Black Earth
 

Openly, yes, 
         With the naturalness 
         Of the hippopotamus or the alligator 
When it climbs out on the bank to experience the 

 Sun, I do these 
Things which I do, which please 
         No one but myself.  Now I breathe and now I am sub- 
         Merged; the blemishes stand up and shout when the object 

In view was a 
Renaissance; shall I say 
         The contrary?  The sediment of the river which 
         Encrusts my joints, makes me very gray but I am used 

To it, it may 
Remain there; do away 
         With it and I am myself done away with, for the 
         Patina of circumstance can but enrich what was 

There to begin 
With.  This elephant skin 
         Which I inhabit, fibered over like the shell of 
         The coco-nut, this piece of black glass through which no light 

Can filter--cut 
Into checkers by rut 
         Upon rut of unpreventable experience-- 
         It is a manual for the peanut-tongued and the 

Hairy toed.  Black 
But beautiful, my back 
         Is full of the history of power.  Of power?  What 
         Is powerful and what is not?  My soul shall never 

Be cut into 
By a wooden spear; through- 
         Out childhood to the present time, the unity of 
         Life and death has been expressed by the circumference 

Described by my 
Trunk; nevertheless, I 
         Perceive feats of strength to be inexplicable after 
         All; and I am on my guard; external poise, it 

Has its centre 
Well nurtured--we know 
         Where--in pride, but spiritual poise, it has its centre where ? 
         My ears are sensitized to more than the sound of 

The wind.  I see 
And I hear, unlike the 
         Wandlike body of which one hears so much, which was made 
         To see and not to see; to hear and not to hear, 

That tree trunk without   
Roots, accustomed to shout 
         Its own thoughts to itself like a shell, maintained intact   
         By who knows what strange pressure of the  atmosphere; that   

Spiritual   
Brother to the coral 
         Plant, absorbed into which, the equable sapphire light 
         Becomes a nebulous green.  The I of each is to 

The I of each, 
A kind of fretful speech 
         Which sets a limit on itself; the elephant is? 
         Black earth preceded by a tendril?  It is to that 

Phenomenon 
The above formation,   
         Translucent like the atmosphere--a cortex merely-- 
         That on which darts cannot strike decisively the first 

Time, a substance 
Needful as an instance 
         Of the indestructibility of matter; it   
         Has looked at the electricity and at the earth- 

Quake and is still 
Here; the name means thick.  Will 
         Depth be depth, thick skin be thick, to one who can see no 
         Beautiful element of unreason under it?






A Graveyard
 

Man, looking into the sea-- 
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have it to yourself-- 
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing 
but you cannot stand in the middle of this: 
the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave. 
The firs stand in a procession--each with an emerald turkey-foot at the top-- 
reserved as their contours, saying nothing; 
repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of the sea; 
the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look. 
There are others besides you who have worn that look-- 
whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer investigate them 
for their bones have not lasted; 
men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are desecrating a grave, 
and row quickly away--the blades of the oars   
moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were no such thing as death. 
The wrinkles progress upon themselves in a phalanx--beautiful under networks of foam, 
and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the seaweed; 
the birds swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls as heretofore-- 
the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion beneath them 
and the ocean, under the pulsation of light-houses and noise of bell-buoys, 
advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which dropped things are bound to sink-- 
in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor consciousness.





For You O Democracy
 

Come, I will make the continent indissoluble,
I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon, 
I will make divine magnetic lands, 
                   With the love of comrades, 
                      With the life-long love of comrades. 

I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of America, and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies, 
I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each other's necks, 
                   By the love of comrades, 
                      By the manly love of comrades. 

For you these from me, O Democracy, to serve you ma femme! 
For you, for you I am trilling these songs.






O Me! O Life!
 

Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill'd with the foolish,
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew'd,
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,
The question, O me! so sad, recurring--What good amid these, O me, O life?

                                       Answer.
That you are here--that life exists and identity,
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.





Another Attempt at Rescue
 

The time is important here--not because this   
has been a long winter or because it is my first   
at home since childhood--but because there is so much   
else to be unsure of. We are on the brink of an invasion.   
At a time like this how is it that when I left only a week ago 
there was three feet of snow on the ground, 
and now there is none, not even a single patch   
on in the shadow of the fence-line.   
And to think I paid a cousin twenty dollars   
to shovel the walk. He and two of his buddies,   
still smelling of an all-nighter, arrived at 7 am   
to begin their work. When I left them a while later   
and noticed their ungloved hands, winter made me feel   
selfish and unsure. This ground seems unsure   
of itself for its own reasons 

and we do not gauge enough of our lives   
by changes in temperature. 
When I first began to write poems 
I was laying claim to battle. 
It started with a death that I tried to say 
was unjust, not because of the actual 
dying, but because of what was left. 
What time of year was that? 
I have still not yet learned to write of war. 
I have friends who speak out--as is necessary--
with subtle and unsubtle force. 
But I am from this place and a great deal 
has been going wrong for some time now. 
The two young Indian boys who almost drowned 
last night in the fast-rising creek near school 
are casualties in any case. 
There have been too many just like them 
and I have no way to fix these things. 

A friend from Boston wrote something to me last week 
about not having the intelligence 
to take as subject for his poems 
anything other than his own life. 
For a while now I have sensed this in my own mood: 
This poem was never supposed to mention 
itself, other writers, or me. 
But I will not regret that those boys made it home, 
or that the cousins used the money at the bar. 
Still, there are no lights on this street. 
Still, there is so much mud outside 
that we carry it indoors with us.





The Feed
 

          
          Several of my cousins lean up against the house, taking long drags from the pack of Marlboros we share. We have always been this way--addicted and generous. A pow wow tape plays from inside the open garage where two old uncles are thinking to themselves in the safety of its shadows. Our aunties are in the kitchen, preparing the boiled meat and chokecherry soup and laughing about old jokes they still hang onto because these things are a matter of survival. Outside, we ask about who was driving around with who last night, where so-and-so got beat up, whose girlfriend left him for someone else. (But she'll go back to him, we all think to ourselves.) Aunties carry the full pots and pans to the picnic table, an uncle prays over our food in Assiniboine. We all want to forget that we don't understand this language, we spend lots of time trying to forget in different ways. No one notices that the wild turnips are still simmering in a pot on the stove.
        




Chokecherries
 

The Crow call this time of year the Black Cherry Moon 
when the rose hips are blood-bright, 
spattered on their overwrought stems, and the creek 
calls so clearly in words almost our own 
as we come sliding down the bank. 
Last night, we covered the gardens in plastic. 
The chickadees were back after their wide diet of summer. 
We ate the last trout, its spine curved from disease. 
So much can go wrong, I want to know 
what you will promise me as our hands reach in and in 
through the copper, the carmine leaves. 
I know you are lonely, alone with your grief 
for your parents who are not my parents, for your life, 
which, despite all, is not my life. The cherries 
are thick here, hanging in clusters, purple-black from frost. 
It started to rain and I am chilled by it. 
Each day, we promise, we will talk of our fears 
of intimacy, how we still expect to be hurt when we love. 
You bring me a coat from the back of the truck, 
but I want to stop our task now, to sit in the cab 
of the truck while the gray spills, slick with thunder. 
What if I kissed you there in depth. 
After so many years, I can misunderstand the difference 
between instinct and obligation, how my hand 
continues to grasp the stems. Keats said 
poems should come easy as leaves off the trees, 
but see how they cling and wrestle with their ties. 
And now, the sun shines. It is not this grace 
I had imagined. When Keats said poems, I meant   
love. The chokecherries roll easily 
into my palm, then fall into the plastic bag that binds 
my writs. Over and over, until we have enough, 
until our fingers are bruised with their dark juices.





Common Blue
 

Their eggs are laid on lupine. Tiny jade 
hairstreaks I could easily mistake for dew. 
Too precious. Too incidental, 
and besides that, blue, these trills that flounce 
in my potato patch, drawn 
from dryland origins to the domestic 
stain of water from my hose. 
What an old woman would study, I think 
as you hand me the guidebook, distracted 
by the replica of a parasol 
growing out of a bleached cow pie. 
The Siamese kitten with his butterfly eyes 
comes running, his mouth full 
of swallowtail, his breath smelling of borax 
and sugar I have poured 
over the ant hills in the garden. 
He is young and intent on eating poison. 
We bushwhack through Paradise, 
what is there to say except to lament 
the daily evidence of its passing. 
How the common blues scatter from my shade. 
And you, so fragile, so sick, so thin, 
your diet restricted, keep pointing out 
the bearded face of larkspur. 
When the angels fell, a fifteenth-centruy bishop says, 
there were 133, 306, 668 of them. 
It takes us all afternoon to cross the field. 
The body, it is so sad what happens to it. 
If you fell, you would dry up instantly. 
But these are not angel wings 
who disguise themselves as leaf or shred of bark, 
who are named after the stops 
in meaning our language must make room for: 
the comma whose wings look battered, 
or the violet underside of the question mark.
To keep the mind from clenching, you say, 
is the main thing. Even the most 
beautiful days always seem to have death in them. 
As Valentinus said; our fall into love and sleep. 
You especially like the dark alpines 
with their furred bodies and lack of marking. 
And the sulphurs, yellowed scraps that fall 
from a myth of origin that doesn't include us. 
When we find them, we will wonder 
who is still alive. We speak of our souls with such 
surface ease. But who will take such care for us? 
You bend and bend to the scrappy blue sea, 
your back turned to the moon fluttering above you. 
I have been thinking so much of strength 
this week, yours and mine, I mean, 
the field of attention that can be strengthened.





Other Fugitives and Other Strangers
 

The nightclub's neon light glows red with anxiety 
as I wait on the turning lane. Cars blur past, 
their headlights white as charcoal. 
I trust each driver not to swerve. I trust each stranger 
not to kill me and let me cross 
the shadow of his smoky path. 
Trust is all I have for patrons at the bar: 
one man offers me a line, one man buys the kamikaze, 
another drinks it. Yet another wraps his arm 
around my waist. I trust him not to harm my body 
as much as he expects his body to remain unharmed. 
One man asks me to the dance floor, one asks me 
to a second drink, another asks me home. 
I dance, I drink, I follow. 
I can trust a man without clothes. 
Naked he conceals no weapons, no threat 
but the blood in his erection. His bed unfamiliar, 
only temporarily. Pillows without loyalty 
absorb the weight of any man, betray 
the scent of the men who came before. 
I trust a stranger's tongue to tell me 
nothing valuable. It makes no promises 
of truth or lies, it doesn't swear commitments. 
The stranger's hands take their time exploring. 
Undisguised, they do not turn to claws or pretend 
artistic skill to draw configurations on my flesh. They 
are only human hands with fingertips 
unsentimental with discoveries, without nostalgia 
for what they leave behind. I trust this stranger 
not to stay inside me once he enters me. 
I trust him to release me from the blame 
of pleasure. The pain I exit with no greater 
than the loneliness that takes me to the bar. 
He says good night, I give him back 
those words, taking nothing with me that is his. 
The front door shuts behind me, the gravel 
driveway ushers me away. The rearview mirror 
loses sight of threshold, house, sidewalk, street. 
Driving by the nightclub I pass a car 
impatient on the turning lane. My hands are cold 
and itch to swerve the wheel, to brand 
his fender with the fury of my headlights. 
But I let this stranger live 
to struggle through the heat and sweat 
of false affections, anonymous and 
borrowed like the glass that washed my prints 
to hold another patron's drink.





The Strangers Who Find Me in the Woods
 

after Thomas James
The strangers in the woods must mimic squirrels and crackle 
with the undergrowth. They must not flinch at the cruelty 
of breaking golden leaves with their feet, or of interring stones. 
And like any of these deciduous trees in autumn they must be 

stingy with shadow and move deceptively across the sludge. 
I listen to these strangers stirring with the evenings. I invent paths 
for them to the soft edge of the lake. Each descent is as graceful 
as a sinking ship, but less tragic somehow because these strangers 

don't possess a lung. I cannot hear them breathe, yet the air 
is all whispers, all sighs--the same ethereal muscle that rubs 
the color off the foliage. I lost my way out of the woods on the night 
every bird went south or numb. A plump rat snatched the moon 

and dragged it by the white rope of its tail. The strangers were 
a cloak of silhouettes flattening against a trunk like bark. 
I must have disappeared among them because the mouth I touched 
was not my own and was cruelly closing in on someone's rib. I carried 

such a bite on me, an arc of green and yellow on my side from the man 
who said he loved me. In that darkness I knew as much about him 
as I did of the amputee swimming his way up the hill with his 
only arm. So this is the home of the unturned stone where 

the fugitive keeps his kiss! Archeologists will discover a paradise 
in the place no touch died of neglect. Is it any wonder all things 
forgotten or abandoned find their way here? The winter is back, so too 
the bloated body of a book I tossed over the bridge last week. 

And there on the bench, is my old smoking habit, a cigarette 
glowing on my mouth like a beacon. I'm patient, waiting for the fugitive 
to claim me as his own. I'm as wise as any stranger here, alone but with 
the knowledge that the grief of separation is always brief.





Tide of Voices
 

At the hour the streetlights come on, buildings 
turn abstract. The Hudson, for a moment, formal.   
We drink bourbon on the terrace and you speak 
in the evening voice, weighted deep in the throat. 

They plan to harvest oysters, you tell me, 
from the harbor by Jersey City, how the waters 
will be clean again in twenty years. I imagine nets 
burdened with rough shells, the meat dun and sexual. 

Below, the river and the high rock 
where boys each year jump from bravado 
or desperation. The day flares, turns into itself. 
And innocently, sideways, the way we always fall 

into grace or knowledge, we watched the police 
drag the river for a suicide, the third this year.   
The terrible hook, the boy's frail whiteness. 
His face was blank and new as your face 

in the morning before the day has worked 
its pattern of lines and tensions. A hook 
like an iron question and this coming 
out of the waters, a flawed pearl-- 

a memory that wasn't ours to claim.   
Perhaps, in a bedroom by lamplight,   
a woman waits for this boy. She may riffle drawers 
gathering photographs, string, keys to abandoned rooms. 

Even now she may be leaving,   
closing the door for some silence. I need 
to move next to you. Water sluiced 
from the boy's hair. I need to watch you 

light your cigarette, the flickering 
of your face in matchlight, as if underwater, 
drifting away. I take your cigarette 
and drag from it, touch your hand. 

Remember that winter of your long fever,   
the winter we understood how fragile 
any being together was. The wall sweated   
behind the headboard and you said you felt 

the rim where dreams crouch 
and every room of the past. It must begin in luxury-- 
do you think--a break and fall into the glamour 
attending each kind of surrender. Water must flood 

the mind, as in certain diseases, the walls 
between the cells of memory dissolve, blur 
into a single stream of voices and faces.   
I don't know any more about this river or if 

it can be cleaned of its tender and broken histories-- 
a tide of voices. And this is how the dead 
rise to us, transformed: wet and singing,   
the tide of voices pearling in our hands.





Jackson Hotel
 

Sometimes after hours of wine I can almost see 
   the night gliding in low off the harbor 
      down the long avenues of shop windows 

past mannequins, perfect in their gestures. 
   I leave some water steaming on the gas ring 
      and sometimes I can slip from my body, 

almost find the single word to prevent evenings 
   that absolve nothing, a winter lived alone 
      and cold. Rooms where you somehow marry 

the losses of strangers that tremble 
   on the walls like the hands 
      of the dancer next door, luminous 

with Methedrine, she taps walls for hours 
   murmuring about the silver she swears 
      lines the building, the hallways 

where each night drunks stammer their 
   usual rosary until they come to rest 
      beneath the tarnished numbers, the bulbs 

that star each ceiling. 
   I must tell you I am afraid to sit here 
      losing myself to the hour's slow erasure 

until I know myself only by this cold weight, 
   this hand on my lap, palm up. 
      I want to still the dancer's hands 

in mine, to talk about forgiveness 
   and what we leave behind--faces 
      and cities, the small emergencies 

of nights. I say nothing, but 
   leaning on the sill, I watch her leave 
      at that moment 

when the first taxis start rolling 
   to the lights of Chinatown, powered 
      by sad and human desire. I watch her fade 

down the street until she's a smudge, 
   violent in the circle of my breath. A figure 
      so small I could cup her in my hands.





Ten Moons
 

And then came the ten moons 
Full in the sun's glare, and the seraphim, 
And it was light all night in the orchards 
And on the plains and even in the towns 
And mankind rejoiced, because it was now the case 
That the wrecking and equivocating could carry on 
The pale night long. Mankind rejoiced 
And went forth to those places twelve hours of light 
Had not made it worth the while to despoil 
And gamboled collectively on the cliff tops 
And regarded the night-broiling of the sea 
Hitherto forbidden, but now opened in festival. 
Half the world's time unpeeled and exposed 
So fruit might ripen faster and trees flourish higher 
And forced photosynthesis green all the land. 
Then night ramblers, night-sun-worshippers, 
Night-motorists fanned out and made the most 
Of spectral light, which bleached out stars and even 
The cozy old moon herself, who had 
Once held a sickle broadside to the sun, and now 
Was a hollow daytime shadow.   
Only a few old believers slept 
Hand in hand, shoulder to breast,   
As if their lives depended on it, knowing yet 
That the morning would bring nothing 
Because the day knew no beginning 
And had no end.





Nether
 

The equilibrium of any particular aspect of nature rests on the equivalence of its opposites. --Piet Mondrian
Some land lives 
so water can comb

it into grids. This
is why lowlands 

tilt still toward
the sea. This so 

we call our canal
leaning horse, 

hat tempting wind, 
somewhere a tear 

in linen where  
the loom bent 

a heddle. We plant
lapis in the middle

of begonia boxes
hung from our 

houseboat's sills.
At night the eels 

snug against 
our houseboat's hum, 

water's warm hem. 
We hear them slip

itch into our floor.
Our houseboat lilts

when the bigger boats
slide us waves. 

Our concrete floats.
We're mostly moored

to stay. In the damp
bank where the ducks

hedge weeds,
our bikes sleep.

We lean toward wind.
Our pant legs thin

from all the rain
on our knees.

From here the horizon
gauzes above us.

We are half hidden 
by light. We are folds

in fog. We stand 
open on the deck 

and beckon the silt 
to settle. We wait 

for a balance so grand 
that any flicker

of inverse could 
pull us up to spires.





What Is the Field?
 

The field is filled   
with what we see 
without sleep. 
Never completely   
closed, it quickly erodes   
when tilled before rain.   

If clogged with boulders 
it won't be razed 
and once burdened 
cannot quicken 
under flocks. 

The field reveals 
glint and holds 
leaning, pulls 
twist from taut 
knots of buds. 

We watch the field   
for stirring, wait   
for stems to spring   
back from sparrows. 

We hope for a swell   
in its middle so   
we can say we saw   
the sway that comes 
from noticing.   

Water meanders 
to prairie potholes,   
throws cordgrass 
into switchbacks 
as we push past   
bramble and scare   
a whistling wheel 
of geese into air. 

The field draws 
hawks and sides 
of trains, cradles 
pools from storms 
where ducks plumb 
for water snails.   

We trample light   
between us, 
no way to lope 
in parting the swales. 
We must flatten   
to fill the space 
with all the rolling 
wrapped up in us.   

Before home,   
the gabled barn   
across the road 
throws the brightest 
rise we've ever seen 
the field try on.   

The field is not 
in rows, is not   
a faded saw-songed 
croon. It pushes green 
a mist above mud, 
shows how we make do. 

We wonder 
what we're not   
in the field. 
What scours, cuts, 
or knocks. 
If we could stay 
and still feel full 
the low line rounding   
out a spread 
of subtle slope.





Clary
 

Her cart like a dugout canoe. 


Had been an oak trunk. 


Cut young.      Fire-scoured. 


What was bark what was heartwood :    P u r e   C h a r - H o l e 


Adze-hacked and gouged. 


Ever after (never not) wheeling hollow there behind her. 


Up the hill toward Bennett Yard; down through Eight-Mile, 
     the Narrows. 


C o m e s   C l a r y   b y   h e r e   n o w 


Body bent past bent.      Intent upon horizon and carry. 


Her null eye long since gone isinglassy, opal. 


--The potent (brimming, fluent) one looks brown. 


C o u r s e s   C l a r y   s u r e   a s   b a y o u   t h r o u g h   h e r e  n o w 


Bearing (and borne ahead by) hull and hold behind her. 


Plies the dark. 


Whole nights most nights along the overpass over Accabee. 


C r o s s e s   C l a r y   b l e s s   h e r   b a r r o w   u p   t h e r e   n o w 


Pausing and voweling there--   the place where the girl fell. 


(                  ) 


Afterwhile passing. 


Comes her cart like a whole-note held.





Rest before you sleep
 

Requiem after Faur, for my father
Rest before you sleep         You'll be walking for hours   
then         as usual         away from home         your shoes   
in your hand         your feet not yet used to the road   
Perhaps they need to feel the gravel   
to know where they're headed 

A woman I knew         who lived mostly in the woods   
mentioned the danger in presuming to know   
what an animal thinks         The fox         for example   
stopping by her open tent and looking in 

I suppose she would've felt this way about your feet   
She would've said how could anyone know   
what a pair of tired feet need along the way 

I would've asked her how she knew the feet   
were tired         Such discourse produces nothing 
but anything less would be silence   
and that would be intolerable   
I wish I knew why I was telling you this 

It's easier to read the mind of a fox than to guess   
what a man's about to say when he returns   
from the woods         head full of roots         veins   
more like branches         shoes in one hand         feet   
blistered         and none of this necessarily   
an indication of how the feet feel         what miles   
uphill and back have done to the soles   
and to the small bones that propel a man 

It's safe now         I think         to speak for the fox 
who is only as cunning as we say it is   
We're the only creatures that claim to be anything   
then build a house of facts around the claim 

I've come for vindication         No point in trying   
to disguise it as a lesser wish         Wake up         stop   
while you still know where you are         Put away   
your elusive country         Give your sleep a rest





Bait Goat
 

There is a 
distance where 
magnets pull, 
we feel, having 
held them   
back. Likewise 
there is a 
distance where 
words attract. 
Set one out 
like a bait goat   
and wait and   
seven others 
will approach. 
But watch out: 
roving packs can 
pull your word 
away. You   
find your stake   
yanked and some   
rough bunch 
to thank.





Crocodile Tears
 

The one sincere 
crocodile has 
gone dry eyed 
for years. Why 
bother crying 
crocodile tears.





Gas Station Rest Room
 

The present tense   
is the body's past tense   
here; hence   
the ghost sludge of hands   
on the now gray strip 
of towel hanging limp 
from the jammed dispenser; 
hence the mirror   
squinting through grime   
at grime, and the worn- 
to-a-sliver of soiled soap   
on the soiled sink. 
The streaked bowl, 
the sticky toilet seat, air 
claustral with stink-- 
all residues and traces 
of the ancestral   
spirit of body free 
of spirit--hence, 
behind the station, 
at the back end of the store, 
hidden away 
and dimly lit 
this cramped and   
solitary carnival   
inversion--Paul 
becoming Saul   
becoming scents 
anonymous   
and animal; hence,   
over the insides   
of the lockless stall 
the cave-like 
scribblings and glyphs   
declaring unto all 
who come to it 
in time: "heaven   
is here at hand 
and dark, and hell   
is odorless; hell 
is bright and clean.





24/7
 

The one cashier is dozing-- 
head nodding, slack mouth open, 
above the cover girl spread out before her on the counter 
smiling up   
with indiscriminate forgiveness 
and compassion for everyone 
who isn't her.   

Only the edge   
is visible of the tightly spooled   
white miles   
of what is soon   
to be the torn off 
inch by inch receipts,   
and the beam of green light in the black glass 
of the self scanner   
drifts free in the space that is the sum 
of the cost of all the items that tonight 
won't cross its path. 

Registers of feeling too precise   
too intricate to feel   
except in the disintegrating 
traces of a dream-- 
panopticon of cameras   
cutting in timed procession 
from aisle to aisle 
to aisle on the overhead screens 
above the carts asleep inside each other-- 
above the darkened   
service desk, the pharmacy, the nursery, 
so everywhere inside the store 
is everywhere at once   
no matter where-- 
eternal reruns   
of stray wisps of steam   
that rise   
from the brightly frozen, 
of the canned goods and food stuffs 
stacked in columns onto columns 
under columns pushed together 
into walls of shelves   
of aisles all celestially effacing 
any trace   
of bodies that have picked   
packed unpacked and placed   
them just so   
so as to draw bodies to the 
pyramid of plums,   
the ziggurats   
of apples and peaches and 
in the bins the nearly infinite   
gradations and degrees of greens   
misted and sparkling. 

A paradise of absence, 
the dreamed of freed 
from the dreamer, bodiless 
quenchings and consummations   
that tomorrow will draw the dreamer 
the way it draws the night tonight   
to press the giant black moth 
of itself against the windows 
of fluorescent blazing.





Iraqi Boy
 

What appear to be   
peach-white, over-washed pajamas   

in the washed-out newspaper photo 

on one side droop   
like a monk's hood,   

the upper half of that leg 

raised with the other, whole one   
and the hands   

they're there! 

and the less washed-out   
pink balloon above them that they reach for or have   

just let go 

--the latter probably as one hand, palm up,   
is wide of it,   

two-thirds of a laughing mouth 

visible, the wheelchair in this case,   
its sparkle stark against   

the flannel and plied living limbs within it, 

a tool of fun. Such wisdom's possible   
here only, the ability to feel   

glad to be alive 

gone on the outside,   
the "cloistered incarceration of the ward   

holding the boys 

as if they were a group of monks.   
Asked by a visitor   

what it's like to live secluded 

most of the time,   
mute and with forced labor,   

a chronic lack of sleep for all the praying, 

the Benedictine monk   
asked back: 

"Have you ever been in love?





Dressing Down, 1962
 

"Shalom, called the pink-shirted man in the Oceanic   
Terminal of Heathrow, and I snapped,   
"I do not want to talk to you. Manic 

with fear, I extended one pointy-tipped shoe, tapped   
the message home. My cases bulged with the wrong   
clothes, every outfit trimmed with clipped 

English, fit for telephone jobs on Long   
Island. Rwanda, Algeria, and me   
declaring every kind of independence. 

My skirt and I were green, not the pretty   
pistachio that Jacqueline Kennedy wore,   
but the color copper develops in the sea, 

cold and unfortunate, the green of storms   
that have never squalled before. My hat,   
gloves, and I were pale, not plush like the warm 

blonde women settling in their seats   
and bubbling dipthongs to their husbands;   
not even poignant, like the champagne satin 

that Marilyn Monroe was buried in.   
Just neutral, stale as a biscuit, off   
as an old cup of milk. I was stubborn, 

I would do what I said and leave   
England. I would ride that El Al jet, mystery   
novel in hand and never grieve. 

Johnny Carson, The Jetsons, and me.   
A new wardrobe in cartoon hues. Meanwhile,   
my row-mate slipped off her court shoes, free 

toes wiggling in hose. "We all went to Israel,   
almost all of us on the flight, and are returning   
to South Carolina, she explained in a drawl 

that frightened me more that the turbofan   
wailing beneath us. In her sundress, her stomach   
looked soft. Ungirdled? Does everyone chat with a twang, 

even the Jews? I do not want to talk,   
but here I am, midair. "Coffee, I replied   
to the hostess, slowly. I will never wear slacks,   

but I can unfasten each word, open it wide.





Arrival
 

Midwinter, the crows take 
their darkness out on day. 
A thin rain falls and breaks. 
I wonder at the way 

the oaks unravel here 
(and travel word of mouth) 
another year. 
Not going, I go south.





The X-Ray
 

Mornings, the body's old 
winter monochrome gives 
its image of extraordinary cold 
to a million hives-- 

I could imagine a lanthorn 
as it swallows its strange light and gleams 
from within as if reborn 
when the bees come.





The Duffel Bag
 

God's blood beads on the tarmac and something rough is boiling up 
just this side of the vanishing point, so it's probably time to get 

off this stretch of blacktop and into the wayside bar, where every cup 
runneth over and you breast a thickening fret 

of stogie smoke to get to the dank back room where a high stakes game 
turns against you despite your trey of jacks, and soon enough   

you're in way over your head with nothing and no one to blame 
but the luck you've been getting since first you threw your stuff 

into a duffel bag and hooked up with the halt and lame, 
with the grifters and drifters, the die-hards, the masters of bluff, 

the very bastards, in fact, who are lifting the last of your stash. . . 
So it's into the crapper and out through the window--you're free 

to do whatever you must, so long as that purple-and-yellow blush 
in the sky doesn't mean what it seems, so long as that lick of flame 

from the hard-shoulder spillage doesn't travel as far as the scree 
of garbage in the lay-by, so long as that's not your name 

in the red top front-page splash on the trailer-trash kidnappee. . . 
Just keep to the shadow-side, keep in under the lee 

of roadside billboards, bed down in the roadside scrub, your dream 
of Ithaca, that ghost town, though the rest is mystery-- 

what brought you to this and who might take the blame, 
and how to get from the open road to a sight of the open sea.





What loves, takes away
 

If the nose of the pig in the market of Firenze 
has lost its matte patina, and shines, brassy,   
even in the half light; if the mosaic saint 
on the tiles of the Basilica floor is half gone,   
worn by the gravity of solid soles, the passing 
of piety; if the arms of Venus have reentered 
the rubble, taken by time, her perennial lover, 
mutilating even the memory of beauty;   
                                                                                                          and if 
the mother, hiding with her child from 
the death squads of brutality, 
if she, trying to keep the child 
quiet, to keep them from being found out,   
holds her hand over his mouth, holds him   
against her, tighter and tighter, until he stops 
breathing;   
                              if the restorer--trying to bring back 
to perfection the masterpiece scarred by its 
transit through time, wipes away 
by mistake, the mysterious smile. . . 
                                                                                                          if what   
loves, and love is, takes away what it aims 
to preserve,   
                                 then here is the place to fall   
silent, meaning well but in danger 
of marring what we would praise, unable 
to do more than wear down the marble   
steps to the altar, smother the fire   
we would keep from the wind's extinction, 
                                                                                                          or if, afraid   
of our fear, we lift the lid from the embers, and send   
abroad, into the parched night, a flight of sparks, 
incendiary, dying to catch somewhere,   
hungry for fuel, the past, its dry provision 
tinder for brilliance and heat, prelude 
to cold, and to ash. . .





Ornithology
 

Gone to seed, ailanthus, the poverty 
   tree. Take a phrase, then 
fracture it, the pods' gaudy nectarine shades 
      ripening to parrots taking flight, all crest 
and tail feathers. 
                           A musical idea. 
                                                 Macaws 
   scarlet and violet, 
                               tangerine as a song 
the hue of sunset where my street becomes water 

and down shore this phantom city skyline's 
   mere hazy silhouette. The alto's 
liquid geometry weaves a way of thinking, 
      a way of breaking 
synchronistic 
                     through time 
                                        so the girl 
   on the comer 
                      has the bones of my face, 
the old photos, beneath the Kansas City hat, 

black fedora lifting hair off my neck 
   cooling the sweat of a night-long tidal 
pull from bar to bar the night we went 
       to find Bird's grave. Eric's chartreuse 
perfume. That 
                   poured-on dress 
                                          I lived days 

and nights inside, 
                           made love 
and slept in, a mesh and slur of zipper 

down the back. Women smoked the boulevards 
   with gardenias after-hours, asphalt shower- 
slick, ozone charging air with sixteenth 
      notes, that endless convertible ride to find 
the grave 
               whose sleep and melody   
                                                 wept neglect 
enough to torch us 
                            for a while 
through snare-sweep of broom on pavement, 

the rumpled musk of lover's sheets, charred 
   cornices topping crosstown gutted buildings.   
Torches us still--cat screech, matte blue steel 
      of pistol stroked across the victim's cheek 
where fleet shoes 
                           jazz this dark 
                                                 and peeling 
block, that one. 
                        Vine Street, Olive. 
We had the music, but not the pyrotechnics-- 

rhinestone straps lashing my shoes, heels sinking 
   through earth and Eric in casual drag, 
mocha cheekbones rouged, that flawless 
      plummy mouth. A style for moving, 
heel tap and 
                  lighter flick, 
                                       lion moan 
of buses pulling away 
                               through the static 
brilliant fizz of taffeta on nyloned thighs. 

Light mist, etherous, rinsed our faces 
   and what happens when 
you touch a finger to the cold stone 
      that jazz and death played 
down to? 
            Phrases. 
                        Take it all 
   and break forever-- 
                              a man 
with gleaming sax, an open sill in summertime, 

and the fire-escape's iron zigzag tumbles 
   crazy notes to a girl cooling her knees, 
wearing one of those dresses no one wears 
      anymore, darts and spaghetti straps, glitzy 
fabrics foaming 
                        an iron bedstead. 
                                                 The horn's 
alarm, then fluid brass chromatics. 
                                                    Extravagant 
ailanthus, the courtyard's poverty tree is spike 
and wing, slate-blue 
                               mourning dove, 
                                                      sudden cardinal flame. 

If you don't live it, it won't come out your horn.





Barking
 

The moon comes up. 
The moon goes down. 
This is to inform you 
that I didn't die young. 
Age swept past me 
but I caught up. 
Spring has begun here and each day 
brings new birds up from Mexico. 
Yesterday I got a call from the outside 
world but I said no in thunder. 
I was a dog on a short chain 
and now there's no chain.





An Instrument Also
 

The climate thinks with its knees. 
When the wound opens, music suspires. 
Opening a gate, I gain the color 
below the roof tiles and the tree limbs. 

You gave me 
the late quartets 
a black bird and 
a white and the 
Garden of Eden. 
Your death belongs 
to anyone but me. 

I wonder so as not to forget. At night in Brooklyn, the tendrils 
of a white sex denuded the sky, shimmering at the tall needle- 
ends of buildings. The traffic was identical in the spring. 

I am protected by only 
music I cannot remember. 
Why is it that the best 
minds ended by composing 
fairy tales? Death swarms. 
There are many new beings, 
the odor of hearts. The order 

of the hour of mating ends. These are many 
new butterflies, and death is no longer to 
be eyed by a young girl, perhaps twelve years 
old, slyly, as though the future were a man's 
sleeve or stride. I wonder so as not to end 
dinner in a farmhouse. We sat at a low table. 
Our host was dying but unaware, as she would 
be murdered the next day in a distant city. There is an out- 
side of language that is not silence. There is an outside of 
God that is not isolation, a domestic animal teaching a dying 
woman to hunt. A wound opens. A gate opens. Tendrils climb.





Bushwick: Latex Flat
 

2001
Sadness of just-painted rooms.   
We clean our tools   
meticulously, as if currying horses:   
the little nervous sash brush   
to be combed and primped,   
the fat old four-inchers   
that lap up space   
to be wrapped and groomed,   
the ceiling rollers,   
the little pencils   
that cover nailheads   
with oak gloss,   
to be counted and packed:   
camped on our dropsheets   
we stare across gleaming floors   
at the door and beyond it   
the old city full of old rumors   
of conspiracies, gunshots, market crashes:   
with a little mallet   
we tap our lids closed,   
holding our breath, holding our lives   
in suspension for a moment:   
an extra drop will ruin everything.





Pity the Bathtub Its Forced Embrace of the Human Form
 

1.   
Pity the bathtub that belongs to the queen its feet 
Are bronze casts of the former queen's feet its sheen 
A sign of fretting is that an inferior stone shows through 
Where the marble is worn away with industrious 
Polishing the tub does not take long it is tiny some say 
Because the queen does not want room for splashing 
The maid thinks otherwise she knows the king 
Does not grip the queen nightly in his arms there are 
Others the queen does not have lovers she obeys 
Her mother once told her your ancestry is your only 
Support then is what she gets in the bathtub she floats 
Never holds her nose and goes under not because 
She might sink but because she knows to keep her ears 
Above water she smiles at the circle of courtiers below 
Her feet are kicking against walls which cannot give 
Satisfaction at best is to manage to stay clean 

2. 
Pity the bathtub its forced embrace of the whims of 
One man loves but is not loved in return by the object 
Of his affection there is little to tell of his profession 
There is more for it is because he works with glass 
That he thinks things are clear (he loves) and adjustable 
(she does not love) he knows how to take something 
Small and hard and hot and make room for 
His breath quickens at night as he dreams of her he wants 
To create a present unlike any other and because he cannot 
Hold her he designs something that can a bathtub of 
Glass shimmers red when it is hot he pours it into the mold 
In a rush of passion only as it begins to cool does it reflect 
His foolishness enrages him he throws off his clothes meaning 
To jump in and lie there but it is still too hot and his feet propel 
Him forward he runs from one end to the other then falls 
To the floor blisters begin to swell on his soft feet he watches 
His pain harden into a pretty pattern on the bottom of the bath 

3. 
Pity the bathtub its forced embrace of the human 
Form may define external appearance but there is room 
For improvement within try a soap dish that allows for 
Slippage is inevitable as is difference in the size of 
The subject may hoard his or her bubbles at different 
Ends of the bathtub may grasp the sponge tightly or 
Loosely it may be assumed that eventually everyone gets in 
The bath has a place in our lives and our place is 
Within it we have control of how much hot how much cold 
What to pour in how long we want to stay when to 
Return is inevitable because we need something 
To define ourselves against even if we know that 
Whenever we want we can pull the plug and get out 
Which is not the case with our own tighter confinement 
Inside the body oh pity the bathtub but pity us too





Gradations of Blue
 

The scent of pig is faint tonight 
as the lime trees hang their heads against gradations of blue, 

looking at the lone suitcase in the middle of the farmyard 
with a sense of solidarity. Also forgotten. 

Its owner never once looked up at them and exclaimed 
I was still soft-fingered when I planted you. 

In the plane, her gaze rests on a flock of cloud-birds, 
pinkish purple with elongated necks, rests 

on the plane's wing-tip colored pink by the sun. 
Her head is heavy with this childhood cargo, 

like the hawk that usually flies between or above their branches, 
found skimming the ground with its catch of mouse or mole,   

or the barge that passes every day at four, its metal nose 
just out of the water, while empty at eight, its sleek sides 

flash signals to those on shore. Later, on the highway 
a row of trucks lit like orange squares in the setting sun-- 

a colony of ants each with a piece of chrysanthemum 
on their backs--begins to reassemble memories; 

the petals become lining, the shape of the flower is lost, 
so that years later, looking at an old photograph, 

she will not remember the names of cousins and uncles 
but the exact bend in the river behind them, the pattern of trees.





In Defense of Our Overgrown Garden
 

Last night the apple trees shook and gave each lettuce a heart 
Six hard red apples broke through the greenhouse glass and 
Landed in the middle of those ever-so-slightly green leaves 
That seem no mix of seeds and soil but of pastels and light and 
Chalk x's mark our oaks that are supposed to be cut down   
I've seen the neighbors frown when they look over the fence 
And see our espalier pear trees bowing out of shape I did like that 
They looked like candelabras against the wall but what's the sense 
In swooning over pruning I said as much to Mrs. Jones and I swear 
She threw her cane at me and walked off down the street without 
It has always puzzled me that people coo over bonsai trees when 
You can squint your eyes and shrink anything without much of   
A struggle ensued with some starlings and the strawberry nets 
So after untangling the two I took the nets off and watched birds 
With red beaks fly by all morning at the window I reread your letter 
About how the castles you flew over made crenellated shadows on   
The water in the rainbarrel has overflowed and made a small swamp 
I think the potatoes might turn out slightly damp don't worry 
If there is no fog on the day you come home I will build a bonfire 
So the smoke will make the cedars look the way you like them 
To close I'm sorry there won't be any salad and I love you





Implications for Modern Life
 

          
          The ham flowers have veins and are rimmed in rind, each petal a little meat sunset. I deny all connection with the ham flowers, the barge floating by loaded with lard, the white flagstones like platelets in the blood-red road. I'll put the calves in coats so the ravens can't gore them, bandage up the cut gate and when the wind rustles its muscles, I'll gather the seeds and burn them. But then I see a horse lying on the side of the road and think You are sleeping, you are sleeping, I will make you be sleeping. But if I didn't make the ham flowers, how can I make him get up? I made the ham flowers. Get up, dear animal. Here is your pasture flecked with pink, your oily river, your bleeding barn. Decide what to look at and how. If you lower your lashes, the blood looks like mud. If you stay, I will find you fresh hay.
        




The Future of Terror / 1
 

The generalissimo's glands directed him 
to and fro. Geronimo! said the ber-goon 
we called God, and we were off to the races. 
Never mind that we could only grow 
gray things, that inspecting the horses' gums 
in the gymnasium predicted a jagged 
road ahead. We were tired of hard news-- 
it helped to turn down our hearing aids. 
We could already all do impeccable imitations 
of the idiot, his insistent incisors working on 
a steak as he said there's an intimacy to invasion. 
That much was true. When we got jaded 
about joyrides, we could always play games 
in the kitchen garden with the prisoners. 
Jump the Gun, Fine Kettle of Fish and Kick 
the Kidney were our favorites. The laws 
the linguists thought up were particularly 
lissome, full of magical loopholes that 
spit out medals. We had made the big time, 
but night still nipped at our heels.   
The navigator's needle swung strangely, 
oscillating between the oilwells 
and ask again later. We tried to pull ourselves 
together by practicing quarterback sneaks 
along the pylons, but the race to the ravine 
was starting to feel as real as the R.I.P.'s 
and roses carved into rock. Suddenly the sight 
of a schoolbag could send us scrambling.





The Future of Terror / 5
 

If there were gamebirds in our gables, 
shouldn't we shoot them ourselves? 
Thus we went glass-faced into glory.   
We had our hearts set on staying here, 
so our steps seemed more hesitation 
waltz than straight-ahead tango.   
We danced the hokey pokey on holy days-- 
put your left arm in heaven, your right leg in hell 
and in the hubbub of shake-it-all-about, 
we didn't hear the hoofbeats. The illuminati 
spoke to us over the intercom via interpreters. 
Meanwhile we had iodine dribbling from 
our wounds and itch mites in our blankets. 
Ours was not a job to joke about.   
In the lantern-light, the lawn speckled 
with lead looked lovely. We would live this 
down by living it up. My pile of looseleaf 
was getting smaller--I wrote in margins,   
through marmalade stains, on the backs of maps.   
I put a piece of mica in the microwave and before 
the explosion it made the mirage I'd imagined. 
I was hoping for a noticeable increase in nutmeats 
or a one night stand in the oubliette. I outwept 
everyone at the pageant, even the children 
from the poorhouse playing possum. 
We studied the protocol for astronaut removal 
the minute we saw his spit hit planet earth 
on the spaceship window. But though the scandal 
reverberated round-the-clock, we had to let it 
slide. He was up there turning somersaults 
while we spun ever-so-slowly below.





Elsewhere, Mon Amour
 

Leaning from the platform, waiting for a glimmer 
to braid the rails 

the eyes of the action hero cut from the poster 

all that concrete pressing down 

A fine edge gleams around your body 
as if it could be contained 

The way each finger is licked, dipped in & 
rubbed across the gums 

until the teeth go away 
Even my hands kiss you 

A night broken down into grains 

If you find yourself lost, dig 

a cave in the snow, quickly 
you need shelter against the night 

A candle could keep you alive 
the engine of your lungs 

will heat the air around you, someone will 
miss you, they will send out dogs 

You must be somewhere, right?





My Mother Contemplating Her Gun
 

One boyfriend said to keep the bullets 

locked in a different room. 
                                    Another urged 
            clean it 
or it could explode. Larry 

thought I should keep it loaded 
under my bed, 
                     you never know. 

            I bought it 
when I didn't feel safe. The barrel 
                         is oily, 

             reflective, the steel 

pure, pulled from a hole 
                      in West Virginia. It 

could have been cast into anything, nails 
along the carpenter's lip, the ladder 

to balance the train. Look at this, one 
                        bullet, 

                        how almost nothing it is-- 

             saltpeter   sulphur   lead   Hell 

burns sulphur, a smell like this. 
                        safety & hammer, barrel & grip 

             I don't know what I believe. 

I remember the woods behind my father's house 
          horses beside the quarry 

stolen cars lost in the deepest wells, 
the water below 
            an ink waiting to fill me. 

                      Outside a towel hangs from a cold line 
            a sheet of iron in the sky 

            roses painted on it, blue roses. 

Tomorrow it will still be there.

Lying
 

To claim, at a dead party, to have spotted a grackle, 
When in fact you haven't of late, can do no harm. 
Your reputation for saying things of interest 
Will not be marred, if you hasten to other topics, 
Nor will the delicate web of human trust 
Be ruptured by that airy fabrication. 
Later, however, talking with toxic zest 
Of golf, or taxes, or the rest of it 
Where the beaked ladle plies the chuckling ice, 
You may enjoy a chill of severance, hearing 
Above your head the shrug of unreal wings. 
Not that the world is tiresome in itself: 
We know what boredom is: it is a dull 
Impatience or a fierce velleity, 
A champing wish, stalled by our lassitude, 
To make or do. In the strict sense, of course, 
We invent nothing, merely bearing witness 
To what each morning brings again to light: 
Gold crosses, cornices, astonishment 
Of panes, the turbine-vent which natural law 
Spins on the grill-end of the diner's roof, 
Then grass and grackles or, at the end of town 
In sheen-swept pastureland, the horse's neck 
Clothed with its usual thunder, and the stones 
Beginning now to tug their shadows in 
And track the air with glitter. All these things 
Are there before us; there before we look 
Or fail to look; there to be seen or not 
By us, as by the bee's twelve thousand eyes, 
According to our means and purposes. 
So too with strangeness not to be ignored, 
Total eclipse or snow upon the rose, 
And so with that most rare conception, nothing. 
What is it, after all, but something missed? 
It is the water of a dried-up well 
Gone to assail the cliffs of Labrador. 
There is what galled the arch-negator, sprung 
From Hell to probe with intellectual sight 
The cells and heavens of a given world 
Which he could take but as another prison: 
Small wonder that, pretending not to be, 
He drifted through the bar-like boles of Eden 
In a black mist low creeping, dragging down 
And darkening with moody self-absorption 
What, when he left it, lifted and, if seen 
From the sun's vantage, seethed with vaulting hues. 
Closer to making than the deftest fraud 
Is seeing how the catbird's tail was made 
To counterpoise, on the mock-orange spray, 
Its light, up-tilted spine; or, lighter still, 
How the shucked tunic of an onion, brushed 
To one side on a backlit chopping-board 
And rocked by trifling currents, prints and prints 
Its bright, ribbed shadow like a flapping sail. 
Odd that a thing is most itself when likened: 
The eye mists over, basil hints of clove, 
The river glazes toward the dam and spills 
To the drubbed rocks below its crashing cullet, 
And in the barnyard near the sawdust-pile 
Some great thing is tormented. Either it is 
A tarp torn loose and in the groaning wind 
Now puffed, now flattened, or a hip-shot beast 
Which tries again, and once again, to rise. 
What, though for pain there is no other word, 
Finds pleasure in the cruellest simile? 
It is something in us like the catbird's song 
From neighbor bushes in the grey of morning 
That, harsh or sweet, and of its own accord, 
Proclaims its many kin. It is a chant 
Of the first springs, and it is tributary 
To the great lies told with the eyes half-shut 
That have the truth in view: the tale of Chiron 
Who, with sage head, wild heart, and planted hoof 
Instructed brute Achilles in the lyre, 
Or of the garden where we first mislaid 
Simplicity of wish and will, forgetting 
Out of what cognate splendor all things came 
To take their scattering names; and nonetheless 
That matter of a baggage-train surprised 
By a few Gascons in the Pyrenees 
Which, having worked three centuries and more 
In the dark caves of France, poured out at last 
The blood of Roland, who to Charles his king 
And to the dove that hatched the dove-tailed world 
Was faithful unto death, and shamed the Devil.

Way Opposite

The opposite of walk? 
      A psychic with a crystal ball 
            and tarot deck 
                        who sees green 
                                    when your palm is read. 

      At the sign of a red palm

                         I run.

The Crowds Cheered as Gloom Galloped Away
 

          
          Everyone was happier. But where did the sadness go? People wanted to know. They didn't want it collecting in their elbows or knees then popping up later. The girl who thought of the ponies made a lot of money. Now a month's supply of pills came in a hard blue case with a handle. You opened it & found the usual vial plus six tiny ponies of assorted shapes & sizes, softly breathing in the Styrofoam. Often they had to be pried out & would wobble a little when first put on the ground. In the beginning the children tried to play with them, but the sharp hooves nicked their fingers & the ponies refused to jump over pencil hurdles. The children stopped feeding them sugarwater & the ponies were left to break their legs on the gardens' gravel paths or drown in the gutters. On the first day of the month, rats gathered on doorsteps & spat out only the bitter manes. Many a pony's last sight was a bounding squirrel with its tail hovering over its head like a halo. Behind the movie theatre the hardier ponies gathered in packs amongst the cigarette butts, getting their hooves stuck in wads of gum. They lined the hills at funerals, huddled under folding chairs at weddings. It became a matter of pride if one of your ponies proved unusually sturdy. People would smile & say, "This would have been an awful month for me, pointing to the glossy palomino trotting energetically around their ankles. Eventually, the ponies were no longer needed. People had learned to imagine their sadness trotting away. & when they wanted something more tangible, they could always go to the racetrack & study the larger horses' faces. Gloom, #341, with those big black eyes, was almost sure to win.
        




Suite for Emily
 

1. The Letter 

Everywhere the windows give up nothing 
but frost's intricate veined foliage. 
Just engines shrilling pocked and frozen streets 
wailing toward some new disaster.   
No bright angels' ladders going to split 
heaven this Chicago instant where the pier's   
an iced fantastic: spiked, the glacial floes 
seize it greedy like a careless treasure-- 

marquise diamonds, these round clear globes, the psychic's 
crystal world spinning in her corner shop 
when I passed, a globe boundaried with turning 
silent winds and demons. Out here the pavement's 
a slick graffitied strip: There's more to life 
than violence. Someone's added Yes, Sex and Drugs. 
Hello, Plague Angel. I just heard your wings 
hiss off the letter on my table--Emily's 

in prison again, her child's lost to the State, 
Massachusetts. Fatigue, pneumonia, 
the wasting away. In the secret hungering,   
the emptiness when we were young would come 
the drug's good sweep like nothing else, 
godly almost the way we'd float immune 
& couldn't nothing touch us, nothing. 
Somehow I'd thought you'd pass her over-- 

positive yes--but never really sick, 
that flayed above her door there'd be some sign 
of mercy. But there's only January's 
rough ministry peeling my face away. 
Light like the cruel light of another century 
& I'm thinking of Dickinson's letter, 
"Many who were in their bloom have gone 
to their last account and the mourners go about 

the streets. The primer pages yellowing 
on her shelf beneath an album of pressed gentian: 
"Do most people live to be old? No, one half die 
before they are eight years old. But one in four lives 
to see twenty-one. She'd known the bitter sponge 
pressed to the fevered forehead, the Death Angel's 
dark familiar company, how she'd swirl her veils, 
how she'd lean over the ewer and basin 

blackening the water. This arctic water, this 
seething rustle--lam, sequins, a glitter wrap 
trailing from a girl's shoulders so the shadow pimps 
go hey princess, why you so sad tonight, 
let me make you happy, when she's only tired, 
up all night & needing a hit to let her sleep. 
We know that story, the crest and billow 
& foam and fleeting fullness 

before the disappearing. Discs of hissing ice, 
doors you (I?) might fall through to the underworld 
of bars & bus stations, private rooms of 
dancing girls numb-sick & cursing the wilderness 
of men's round blank faces. Spinning demons. 
Round spoon of powder hissing over the flame. 
Worlds within worlds, beneath worlds, worlds that flare 
and consume so they become the only world. 


   2. Holy City, City of Night 

What is that general rule which tells 
   how long a thing will live? The primer answers, 
Whatever grows quick decays quick: soon ripe, 
   soon rotten. The rust-blown calla gracing   
my table, those Boston girls 20 years gone, 
young men in lace & glitter washed alien 
   by gasoline sunsets, the burning sphere 
lapsing below night's black rim. Live fast, die. . . 

we know the rest. Reckless anthem. 
   The pier cable's ice-sleeved beneath 
my hands--miraculous, yes, to be here 
   januaried by this lake's barbaric winterscape 
Dickinson might read as savage text 
& emblem of a deity indifferent. Her embassy lay 
   beyond the city of jasper & gold, the beaten 
wrought towers scripture promised the saved 

would enter. What heaven she found she made.   
   And so did we, worlds that sear, consume--earthly, 
delirious. Ignis fatuus. Strike the match, 
   the fizzing cap. But Oh Reader, the wild beauty 
of it, the whirring rush, blond hiss of aerial 
miles, worn stairways in every burning school 
   of nodding classrooms, the buzz-snap of 
talk blurring hallucinatory fraught 
avenues. Illusive inner city, drugged 
   majestic residence spiraled with staircases, 
balustrades rococoed, lapidary. Invisible empires 
   dreamt beneath the witchery of birds 
circling the Common with twilight, their caw 
& settle, the patterns as they wheel 
   over the pond's reflective mirror bruised 
roseate, violet, deeper, the swanboats 

darkening into night's charged dazzle, 
   Park Square joints gone radiant, the bus station 
burnished before the zap, the charge, the edge.   
   It was the life, wasn't it? Compatriots you'd   
just love to die for, who'd jump you 
in a New York minute. But the glory 
   as the lights went up, torching the air chartreuse, 
lipsticked pink, casting embers, seraphic fires 

fallen earthward. Fallen, the furious emblems.   
   We were so young we'd spend & spend 
ourselves as if there'd be no reckoning, then grew 
   past caring. All the darkening chapters. 
Dream time, the inner time 
where towers and battlements erect 
   their coruscating glamour & how we'd glide, 
celebrities among them, the crowds falling back, 

dream deeper, gone & wake to daylight's assault 
   knocking another bare room, the alley, the bathroom 
you inhabit like the thief you are. Ignis fatuus. 
   I can follow you there, Emily, we girls 
setting out a thousand ruined nights in the splendor 
of the torched & reckless hour. 
   Who wouldn't trade heaven for that fleet city 
when winter beaks the shattered pane, 

when summer's a nauseous shimmmer 
   of sexual heat, though sex is a numb machine 
you float above? When the place you walk into 
   is a scream in the shape of yourself. 
When it makes perfect sense to blow someone away 
for 20 bucks beyond even your bleak human universe. 
   When the only laughter that falls down 
is iron & godless. Here, I--the one who left-- 

must falter where persists 
   this chrome traffic shrill, where the cable's 
bitter alloy comes away in my hand, 
   this metaled pungence of hair and skin 
in wind persists riven as the taste of myself, 
the blood blooming healthy, 
   real in my mouth, a future's lavish venues 
spread stunned before me. These hands. 


   3. Combat Zone/War Stories 

The district's been demolished, sown with salt. 
The dazzling girls, girls, girls in platinum wigs 
have been lifted away by some infernal agency, 
the queens, exotic Amazons & rough-trade gay boys. 

Sometimes I go back to walk the streets all shops 
and swank hotels, the office blocks & occasional 
burnt-out shell. So American, this destruction 
& renewal, cities amnesiac where evening's 

genesis falls through vast deserted silences, 
towers grown otherworldly with light 
thrown starlike from some alien world. Gone the Show Bar, 
the Mousetrap, the whole gaudy necklace 

of lacquer-dark underground lounges, halls 
of mirrors, music billowing dancers 
clean out of themselves beyond the dead-faced tricks, 
the sick voyeurs. The Combat Zone. I can map it 

in my mind, some parallel world, the ghost city 
beneath the city. Parallel lives, the ones 
I didn't choose, the one that kept her. 
In all that dangerous cobalt luster 

where was safety? Home? When we were delirium 
on rooftops, the sudden thrill of wind dervishing 
cellophane, the shredded cigarettes. We were 
the dust the Haitians spit on to commemorate 

the dead, the click & slurried fall of beads 
across a doorway. In the torn & watered silk 
of night, the Zone exploded its shoddy neon orchid 
to swallow us in the scent of fear, emergency, 

that oily street perfume & weeping brick. 
Gossamer clothes, summertime and leaning 
against the long dusty cars, cruising siren songs. 
Summer? My memory flutters--had I--was there summer? 

Dancer, and floor, and cadence 
quite gathered away, and I a phantom, to you 
a phantom, rehearse the story. 
And now it's autumn turning hard to winter, 

Thanksgiving, 1990, & all she wants is sweets 
so it's apple pie barehanded & Emily's 
spinning war stories, how bad she is: So, I say, 
go ahead and shoot me, put me out of my misery. 

Cut me motherfucker--my blood's gonna kill you. 
Then she's too tired to sit & in the blue 
kaleidoscopic TV shift I stroke 
her hair, the ruined hands. I didn't know 

how sick I was--if the heroin wanted the AIDS, 
or if the disease wanted the heroin. She asks me 
to line up her collection of matchbox houses 
so we can make a street, so we can make a neighborhood.   


   4. Jail, Flames--Jersey, 1971 

The psychic's globe whirls its winds: demons, 
   countless futures, the pasts. Only 
      thirteen the first time 
   I saw you in jail, just a kid looking 
up at me, the usual grey detective clamor, 

inkpads & sodium flash. Hauled out by the officials, 
   exemplary bad-news girl, they shoved 
      a lyric sheet at me. Command 
   recitation to sway you from straying.   
"King Heroin, James Brown pompadoured like nobody's 

business & here's Death cartoonishly aloft on a white 
   winged horse, grim reaper lording it 
      over the shivering denizens 
   of a city, exaggerated as any Holy City, 
going down, down, down. Just a kid, you, peering out 

the jungle of your dark hair, greasy jeans, a tangle 
   of beads at your throat. Ludicrous, 
      I know, me declaiming within 
   the jail gleam that never sleeps all over us, 
that effluvium of backed-up plumbing. On my palm, 

the bar's iron taint lingered for hours after. 
   It didn't mean that much to me, seventeen, 
      my practiced sangfroid 
   chilling the terror, that long drop 
inside, the way you collapse to fall in flames. 

I might have said you'll pay for the wild & reckless hour, 
   pay in the currency of sweat and shiver, 
      the future squandered, the course 
   of years reconfigured, relinquishment so 
complete it's more utter than any falling in love. Falling 

instead in flames, burning tiles spiraling to litter 
   the courtyards of countless places that will 
      never be yours, the fingerprints, 
   tossed gloves & glittering costumes, flared 
cornices & parapets, shattering panes, smoked out 

or streaked with embers, the tinder of spools, such 
   a savage conflagration, stupid edge-game, 
      the way junkies tempt death, 
   over & over again, toy with it. I might have 
told you that. Everything you ever meant to be, pfft, 

out the window in sulphured matchlight, slow tinder 
   & strike, possession purely ardent as worship 
      & the scream working its way out 
   of your bones, demolition of wall & strut 
within until you're stark animal need. That is 

love, isn't it? Everything you meant to be falls 
   away so you dwell within a perfect 
      singularity, a kind of saint. 
   Pearl of great price. Majestic, searing, 
the crystal globe spins futures unimaginable, that 

crucible you know so well, Emily, viral fever refining 
   you to some essence of pain more furious   
      than these winter trees 
   stripped to black nerves above 
the El's streaked girders, a harsh equation, some 

god's iron laughter combing down time's blind 
   & hush. Hush child, forgive me. 
      Twenty years later, you say 
   that night in jail you looked up 
at me & wanted to be me. And I didn't care. 


   5. Address 

Hello Death Angel, old familiar, old nemesis. 
   In the deepest hours, I have recognized 
your floating shape. I've seen your breath 
   seduce the torn curtain 
masking the empty window, have crouched with you   
   in the doorway, curled in the alley 
hooded in your essence & shadow, have 
   been left blue, heart-stopped 
for yours, for yours. Death, 
   you are the bead in the raptor's eye,   
Death you dwell in the funneling depths 
   of the heavens beyond each 
star's keening shrill, Death you are the potion 
   that fills the vial, the night 
the monuments have swallowed. You live 
   in the maimed child wrapped in a wreckage 
of headlines. Death you center 
   in the fanged oval 
of the prison dog's howl. Death you dwell within 
   the necropolis we wake to in nightmare's 
hot electric wind. You glint 
   the edge of the boy's razor,   
patient in the blasted stairwell. Everywhere 
   you walk deep lawns, TVs pollinating air 
with animals wired up to dance 
   for their food, with executions 
& quiz shows. You're in the column 
   of subway wind roaring before each 
train's arrival. I've seen you drape thoughtlessly 
   a woman's hair over her face 
as the shot carried her forward into stop-time 
   & beyond anything she's laid 
her money down for. Death your sliver works 
   swiftly through the bloodstream. 
Hello Death Angel, Plague is your sister. 
   I've seen her handiwork, heard 
the tortured breath, watched her loosen the hands 
   of the dazzling boys from each other. 
For love, love. I've seen the AIDS hotels 
   & sick ones begging homeless 
in the tunnels, the whispered conspiracies. 
   Shameless emissaries with your powders 
& wands, your lunar carnivorous flowers. 
   Tricks, legerdemain. I've seen you draw 
veined wings over the faces of sleepers, 
   the abandoned, the black feather that sweeps 
so tenderly. I've seen the stain you scribe 
   on the pavement, the glossy canopy of leaves 
you weave. I've seen waste & ruin, know 
   your kingdom for delirium, the furious thumbprints 
you've scored on the flesh of those you choose. 
   I've seen you slow-dance in a velvet mask, dip 
& swirl across dissolving parquet. 
   I've seen you swing open the iron gate-- 
a garden spired in valerian, skullcap, blue vervain. 
   Seen you stir in the neat half-moons, fingernails 
left absently in a glazed dish. 
   Felons, I've cursed you in your greed, have spat 
& wept then acquiesced in your wake. Without rue 
   or pity, you have marked the lintels & blackened 
the water. Your guises multiply, bewildering 
   as the firmament's careless jewelry. 
Death I have welcomed you to the rooms 
   where Plague has lain when the struggle is passed 
& lit the candles and blessed the ash.   
   Death you have taken my friends & dwell 
with my friends. You are the human wage. 
   Death I am tired of you. 


   6. Dartmouth Women's Prison, 1992 

Emily, delirium's your province. 
You dwell feverish in prison   
voiceless to plead   
your need before the agencies 
of government who cannot hear the buildings 
falling & oil exploding, only people walking 
& talking, cannon soft as velvet from parishes 
that do not know you are burning up, 
that seasons have rippled 
like a beast the grasses beyond 
the prison. 
                They cannot hear the strummed harp 
or the nerves, black trees swaying winter, 
cannot know your child is lost to you. 

The human wage that's paid & paid? 

Once, we were two girls 
setting out toward that city 
of endless searing night, the route taking on 
the intricacy, the fumes & bafflements 
of a life a woman might dream turning 
feverish in her prison bunk. Probation violation,   
when broke & sick, no way home 
from the clinic, the detective going 
ride with me, just talk, that's all 
I want. Twenty bucks and him crowing   
we just love to run you little sluts in. 

Em, if I could reach you through the dust motes' 
spinning, infernoed dreams, I would dwell 
in the moon's cool glistering 
your cell, the rough cloth, the reflection 
of your face given back in the steel basin's 
water, in the smooth moan of women loving women, 
a cacophony of needs. I am there with you lost 
in the chaos of numbers, that nattering P.A. buzz, 
in the guards' trolling clank & threat echoing 
walls so eloquent 
with all the high-frequency sizzle 
of anguish they've absorbed. 
Emily, I will bless your child, will 
hold for you the bitter sponge, 
would give you staff & orb, a firmament 
radiant & free. 

                     But these are phantoms, lies-- 
I cannot follow where you are. On my street, 
the psychic's crystal globe whirls pasts, futures 
but where you are is timeless. 
Pain--has an Element of Blank--It cannot recollect 
when it Began--or if there were 
a time when it was not-- 
It has no Future--but itself. . . 

Off the lake a toothed wind keens 
& it's just me here, the one who's left. 
Just me helpless to change anything caught 
in this ellipsis between traffic, this 
fleet human delay, all around 
the wind singing like a mechanical ballerina 
a girl might hold in her hand, the one 
that watched your childhood bed, porcelain 
upturned gaze, stiff tutu, dust in the folds 
of that spindly piercing music sounding 
of voices winged over water, becoming   
water, & gone. 


   7. A Style of Prayer 

There is a prayer that goes Lord I am powerless 
   over these carnivorous streets, the fabulous 
      breakage, the world's ceaseless perpetuum mobile, 

like some renaissance design, lovely & useless 
   to harness the forces of weather, the planet's 
      dizzy spin, this plague. A prayer that asks 

where in the hour's dark moil is mercy? 
   Ain't no ladders tumbling down from heaven 
      for what heaven we had we made. An embassy 

of ashes & dust. Where was safety? Home? 
   Is this love, staff, orb & firmament? 
      Parallel worlds, worlds within worlds--chutes 

& trapdoors in the mind. Sisters & brothers, 
   the same thing's going down all over town, town 
      after town. There is a prayer that goes Lord, 

we are responsible. Harrow us through the waves, 
   the runnels & lace that pound, comb, reduce us so 
      we may be vessels for these stories. 

Oh, the dazzling men torn one from the other, 
   these women taken, these motherless children. 
      Perhaps there's no one to fashion such new grace, 

the world hurtling its blind proposition 
   through space & prayer's merely a style of waiting 
      beyond the Hour of Lead-- 

Remembered, if outlived, 
   As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow-- 
      First Chill--then Stupor--then the letting go. . . 

But oh, let Emily become anything 
   but the harp she is, too human, to shiver 
      grievous such wracked & torn discord. Let her be 

the foam driven before the wind over the lakes, 
   over the seas, the powdery glow floating 
      the street with evening--saffron, rose, sienna 

bricks, matte gold, to be the good steam 
   clanking pipes, that warm music glazing the panes, 
      each fugitive moment the heaven we choose to make. 








Rivers into Seas
 

For Wally Roberts, 1951-1994
Palaces of drift and crystal, the clouds 
loosen their burden, unworldly flakes so thick 
the border zones of sea and shore, the boundless zones 
of air fuse to float their worlds until the spirits   
congregate, fleet histories yearning into shape. 

Close my eyes and I'm a vessel. Make it 
some lucent amphora, Venetian blue, lip circled 
in faded gold. Can you see the whorls of breath, 
imperfections, the navel where it was blown 
from the maker's pipe, can you see it drawn 

up from the bay where flakes hiss the instant 
they become the bay? Part the curtain. The foghorn's 
steady, soothing moan--warning, safety, the reeling 
home. Shipwreck and rescue. Stories within stories-- 
there's this one of the cottage nestled into dune 

snowed into pure wave, the bay beyond and its lavish 
rustle, skirts lifting and falling fringed in foam.   
But I'm in another season--my friends' house adrift,   
Wally's last spring-into-summer, his bed a raft, 
cats and dogs clustered and we're watching television 

floods, the Mississippi drowning whole cities 
unfamiliar. How could any form be a vessel 
adequate to such becoming, the stories unspooled 
through the skein of months as the virus erased 
more and more until Wally's nimbused as these 

storm clouds, the sudden glowing ladders they let fall? 
But that's not the moment I'm conjuring--it's when 
my voyager afloat so many months brought back   
every flood story I carried. Drifting worlds, 
and Wai Min takes a shape I tell Wally as 

steady watermarks across the cold bare floor-- 
Chinatown, South Pacific flashing its crimson, 
neoned waves tranced across Wai Min's midnight eyes 
behind black shades, and that voice unraveling past 
each knocking winter pain. It's another world 

I'm telling, Cognac and squalor. The foghorn's haunting drone 
blends with that halting monotone, scarlet watermarks, 
the Sinkiang's floodtides murky brown, the village 
become water, swept away. Three days floating on a door, 
his sister, the grandmother weaving stories endless 

beneath the waxed umbrella canopy she's fashioned, 
stories to soothe the children wrapped in the curtain 
of her hair, to calm the ghost souls' blurred lanterns. 
How rats swam to their raft, soaked cats, spirits 
she said, ghosts held tranced by the storied murmurous 

river. I have no spell, simply the foghorn's song 
when voices unbodied, drift over water past 
the low dune this cottage nestles in becoming 
shape in motion stilled. No boundaries on this point, 
foghorn singing its come-home incantation over 

the ruthless currents. And isn't it so 
we're merely vessels given in grace, in mystery, 
just a little while, our fleet streaked moments? 
As this day is given, singular, chilly 
bolts of snow chenilled across the sky, the sea. 

How to cipher where one life begins and becomes 
another? Part the curtain and here's my voyager 
afloat, gentle sleeper, sweet fish, dancer over 
water and he's talking, laughing in 
that great four-poster bed he could not leave 

for months, a raft to buoy his furious radiant soul, 
if I may hazard to say that? Yes, 
there was laughter, the stories, the shining dogs-- 
gold and black--his company. Voyager afloat 
so many months, banks of sunflowers he loved spitting 

their seeds. Tick. Black numerals on the sill. 
A world can be built anywhere & he spun, letting go. . . . 
The last time I held him, the last time we spoke, just 
a whisper--hoarse--that marries now this many-voiced mansion 
of storm and from him I've learned to slip my body, 

to be the storm governed by the law of bounty given 
then taken away. Shush and glide. This tide's running 
high, its silken muscular tearing ruled by cycles,   
relentless, the drawn lavish damasks--teal, aquamarine, 
silvered steel, desire's tidal forces, such urgent 

fullness, the elaborate collapse, and withdrawal 
beyond the drawn curtain that shows the secret 
desert of bare ruched sand. I've learned this,   
I've learned to be the horn calling home 
the journeyer, saying farewell. And here's 

the foghorn's simple two-note wail, 
mechanical stark aria that ripples 
out to shelter all of us-- 
our mortal burden of dreams-- 
adrift in the sea's restless shouldering. 






Bar Xanadu
 

A perfect veronica, invisible, scallops air 
before the bull, the bartender's fluttering hands. 
Tipped with silken fruit tinseled gold,   
a dusty banderilla hangs above racked bottles, 
burnt-orange. Your lacquered fingers streak 
the cocktail napkin and the globe of cognac's 

fragrant on the zinc bar. Fields of chamomile.   
Close your eyes and then the night turns to coal 
seamed with diamonds. Outside, a girl murmurs 
her tired price, in pesetas, to passing men.   
Irita, the barman calls when she wanders in 
to wash at the single coldwater tap. Just a fly-blown 

caf on your functionary's street of flats, bedrooms 
shuttered around their whispering, the shops that gleam 
by day with scaled cellophane piglets, mounded bins 
of fruit and olives. Irita rewinds her hair 
at the bar, a gilt rosette nestling its waves,   
tattered bullfight posters on the wall behind her 

and you think of Rita Hayworth tossing roses 
in Blood and Sand, the frayed banderilla.   
Such a lovely thing to torture an animal with, 
the corrida's exacting choreography 
of life and death. Sometimes it's soothing to evaporate 
in this smoke-patinaed air, abandoning 

your imposter's life of embassy files breathing 
the military names and numbers, Torrejn's 
precise cold barracks. Your face wavers, oddly calm 
in the mirror as the girl talks dancing and   
flamenco clubs to the barman, absinthe glass shining 
derangement in his hand. It's the place in the night 

where you carve an uneasy confederacy   
from vapor and exhaustion, a trio--the alien, 
the clownish poseur, the girl with nothing to sell 
but herself and straitened, cataleptic dreams. 
She stretches, plays idly the slot machines 
spinning roses, babies and lemons, the brilliant 

suit of lights. The caramel glow of the barlamps haloes 
her hair, bitten lips. Another sip and the slots' 
click is rosary beads wafting prayers up 
to a heaven of slink and spangle, quick bargains 
struck in alcoves, that old palm of chapped fingers 
slipping coins to the gas meter, of spreading stain 

across the counterpane. Around Bar Xanadu 
narrow streets fill with the violet steam 
of after-midnight, the pigeons' soft venereal   
cooing that speak of want like this, that deep 
original loneliness. There are heartless places 
in every city you've lived. Cognac spreads 

its window of warmth and the drifting years return   
bordered with the crimes of night, with cramped 
rooms you've climbed to, dead as the money 
in your pockets. A "dimestore Mata Hari, 
the bureau chief called you while he snipped 
a fresh cigar. On parched plains outside the city 

soldier boys drill before the fighter planes, glamorous 
with starlight, still floating half-asleep 
in some Iowa of vinyl booths and Formica, miles 
of hissing corn. But it's closing hour and beneath 
your fingers the napkin snows its raddled lace 
across the bar and you must rise with them, rise 

to dust with the barman his green bottle, help him 
to don the sparkling jacket. Rise to strap   
the magic shoes to Irita's feet 
and then you must walk with her these streets 
you'll never leave, gritty with wind from Andalusia 
riffling your skirt in the scent of blood oranges and sweat.





The Evening Wind
 

Spirit that breathest through my lattice, thou

   That cool'st the twilight of the sultry day, 

Gratefully flows thy freshness round my brow:

   Thou hast been out upon the deep at play,

Riding all day the wild blue waves till now,

   Roughening their crests, and scattering high their spray

And swelling the white sail. I welcome thee

To the scorched land, thou wanderer of the sea!


Nor I alone--a thousand blossoms round

   Inhale thee in the fulness of delight;

And languid forms rise up, and pulses bound

   Livelier, at coming of the wind of night;

And, languishing to hear thy grateful sound, 

   Lies the vast inland stretched beyond the sight.

Go forth into the gathering shade; go forth,

God's blessing breathed upon the fainting earth!


Go, rock the little wood-bird in his nest,

   Curl the still waters, bright with stars, and rouse

The wide old wood from his majestic rest, 

   Summoning from the innumerable boughs

The strange, deep harmonies that haunt his breast:

   Pleasant shall be thy way where meekly bows.

The shutting flower, and darkling waters pass,

And where the o'ershadowing branches sweep the grass.


The faint old man shall lean his silver head

   To feel thee; thou shalt kiss the child asleep,

And dry the moistened curls that overspread

   His temples, while his breathing grows more deep:

And they who stand about the sick man's bed,

   Shall joy to listen to thy distant sweep,

And softly part his curtains to allow

Thy visit, grateful to his burning brow.


Go--but the circle of eternal change,

   Which is the life of nature, shall restore,

With sounds and scents from all thy mighty range

   Thee to thy birthplace of the deep once more;

Sweet odours in the sea-air, sweet and strange,

   Shall tell the home-sick mariner of the shore;

And, listening to thy murmur, he shall deem

He hears the rustling leaf and running stream.





Grace
 

for Darlene Wind and James Welch
I think of Wind and her wild ways the year we had nothing to lose and lost it anyway in the cursed country of the fox. We still talk about that winter, how the cold froze imaginary buffalo on the stuffed horizon of snowbanks. The haunting voices of the starved and mutilated broke fences, crashed our thermostat dreams, and we couldn't stand it one more time.So once again we lost a winter in stubborn memory, walked through cheap apartment walls, skated through fields of ghosts into a town that never wanted us, in the epic search for grace.Like Coyote, like Rabbit, we could not contain our terror and clowned our way through a season of false midnights. We had to swallow that town with laughter, so it would go down easy as honey. And one morning as the sun struggled to break ice, and our dreams had found us with coffee and pancakes in a truck stop along Highway 80, we found grace.
   I could say grace was a woman with time on her hands, or a white buffalo escaped from memory. But in that dingy light it was a promise of balance. We once again understood the talk of animals, and spring was lean and hungry with the hope of children and corn.
   I would like to say, with grace, we picked ourselves up and walked into the spring thaw. We didn't; the next season was worse. You went home to Leech Lake to work with the tribe and I went south. And, Wind, I am still crazy. I know there is something larger than the memory of a dispossessed people. We have seen it.





Invictus
 

Out of the night that covers me, 
      Black as the pit from pole to pole, 
I thank whatever gods may be 
      For my unconquerable soul. 

In the fell clutch of circumstance 
      I have not winced nor cried aloud. 
Under the bludgeonings of chance 
      My head is bloody, but unbowed. 

Beyond this place of wrath and tears 
      Looms but the Horror of the shade, 
And yet the menace of the years 
      Finds and shall find me unafraid. 

It matters not how strait the gate, 
      How charged with punishments the scroll, 
I am the master of my fate, 
      I am the captain of my soul. 






During the War
 

When my brother came home from war 
he carried his left arm in a black sling 
but assured us most of it was still there. 
Spring was late, the trees forgot to leaf out. 

I stood in a long line waiting for bread. 
The woman behind me said it was shameless, 
someone as strong as I still home, still intact 
while her Michael was burning to death. 

Yes, she could feel the fire, could smell 
his pain all the way from Tarawa 
or was it Midway?and he so young, 
younger than I, who was only fourteen, 

taller, more handsome in his white uniform 
turning slowly gray the way unprimed wood 
grays slowly in the grate when the flames 
sputter and die. "I think I'm going mad, 

she said when I turned to face her. She placed 
both hands on my shoulders, kissed each eyelid, 
hugged me to her breasts and whispered wetly 
in my bad ear words I'd never heard before. 

When I got home my brother ate the bread 
carefully one slice at a time until 
nothing was left but a blank plate. "Did you see her, 
he asked, "the woman in hell, Michael's wife? 

That afternoon I walked the crowded streets 
looking for something I couldn't name, 
something familiar, a face or a voice or less, 
but not these shards of ash that fell from heaven.





Chrysalis
 

Corpses push up through thawing permafrost 

as I scrape salmon skin off a pan at the sink; 
on the porch, motes in slanting yellow light 

undulate in air. Is Venus at dusk as luminous 
as Venus at dawn? Yesterday I was about to 

seal a borax capsule angled up from the bottom 

of a decaying exterior jamb when I glimpsed 
jagged ice floating in a bay. Naval sonar 

slices through whales, even as a portion 
of male dorsal fin is served to the captain 

of an umiak. Stopped in traffic, he swings from 

a chairlift, gazes down at scarlet paintbrush. 
Moistening an envelope before sealing it,   

I recall the slight noise you made when I 
grazed your shoulder. When a frost wiped out   

the chalk blue flowering plant by the door,   

I watered until it revived from the roots. 
The song of a knife sharpener in an alley 

passes through the mind of a microbiologist 
before he undergoes anesthesia for surgery. 

The first night of autumn has singed   

bell peppers by the fence, while budding    
chamisa stalks in the courtyard bend to ground.   

Observing people conversing at a nearby table,   
he visualizes the momentary convergence   

and divergence of lines passing through a point.   

The wisteria along the porch never blooms;   
a praying mantis on the wood floor sips water   

from a dog bowl. Laughter from upstairs echoes   
downstairs as teenage girls compare bra sizes.   

An ex-army officer turned critic frets    

over the composition of a search committee,   
snickers and disparages rival candidates.   

A welder, who turns away for a few seconds   
to gaze at the Sangre de Cristos, detects a line   

of trucks backed up on an international overpass   

where exhaust spews onto houses below.   
The day may be called One Toothroad or Six Thunderpain,   

but the naming of a day will not transform it,   
nor will the mathematics of time halt. 

An imprint of ginkgo leaf--fan-shaped, slightly 

thickened, slightly wavy on broad edge, two- 
lobed, with forking parallel veins but no 

midvein--in a slab of coal is momentary beauty, 
while ginkgoes along a street dropping gold 

leaves are mindless beauty of the quotidian. 

Once thought extinct, the ginkgo 
was discovered in Himalayan monasteries   

and propagated back into the world. Although   
I cannot save a grasshopper singed by frost   

trying to warm itself on a sunlit walkway, 

I ponder shadows of budding pink and orange      
bougainvilleas on a wall. As masons level sand, 

lay bricks in horizontal then vertical pairs, 
we construct a ground to render a space   

our own. As light from a partial lunar eclipse 

diffuses down skylight walls, we rock and   
sluice, rock and sluice, fingertips fanned   

to fanned fingertips, debouch into plenitude. 
Venus vanishes in a brightening sky:   

the diamond ring of a solar eclipse persists. 

You did not have to fly to Zimbabwe in June 2001   
to experience it. The day recalls Thirteen Death 

and One Deer when an end slips into a beginning. 
I recall mating butterflies with red dots on wings, 

the bow of a long liner thudding on waves, 

crescendo of water beginning to boil in a kettle, 
echoes of humpback whales. In silence, dancers 

concentrate on movements onstage; lilacs bud 
by a gate. As bits of consciousness constellate, 

I rouse to a 3 A.M. December rain on the skylight. 

A woman sweeps glass shards in a driveway, 
oblivious to elm branches reflected on windshields 

of passing cars. Juniper crackles in the fireplace; 
flukes break the water as a whale dives. 

The path of totality is not marked by   

a shadow hurtling across the earth's surface   
at three thousand kilometers per hour. 

Our eyelashes attune to each other. 
At the mouth of an arroyo, a lamb skull 

and ribcage bleach in the sand; tufts   

of fleece caught on barbed wire vanish. 
The Shang carved characters in the skulls 

of their enemies, but what transpired here? 
You do not need to steep turtle shells 

in blood to prognosticate clouds. Someone 

dumps a refrigerator upstream in the riverbed 
while you admire the yellow blossoms of 

a golden rain tree. A woman weeds, sniffs 
fragrance from a line of onions in her garden; 

you scramble an egg, sip oolong tea. 

The continuous bifurcates into the segmented 
as the broken extends. Someone steals 

a newspaper while we doze. A tiger   
swallowtail lands on a patio columbine; 

a single agaric breaks soil by a hollyhock. 

Pushing aside branches of Russian olives   
to approach the Pojoaque River, we spot 

a splatter of flicker feathers in the dirt. 
Here chance and fate enmesh. 

Here I hold a black bowl rinsed with tea, 

savor the warmth at my fingertips,   
aroma of emptiness. We rock back and forth,   

back and forth on water. Fins of spinner 
dolphins break the waves; a whale spouts 

to the north-northwest. What is not impelled? 

Yellow hibiscus, zodiac, hairbrush;   
barbed wire, smog, snowflake--when I still   

my eyes, the moments dilate. Rain darkens   
gravel in the courtyard; shriveled apples   

on branches are weightless against dawn.





Anecdote of the Jar
 

I placed a jar in Tennessee, 
And round it was, upon a hill. 
It made the slovenly wilderness 
Surround that hill. 

The wilderness rose up to it, 
And sprawled around, no longer wild. 
The jar was round upon the ground 
And tall and of a port in air. 

It took dominion everywhere. 
The jar was gray and bare. 
It did not give of bird or bush, 
Like nothing else in Tennessee.





Adam Waking
 

We chose this animal to be our pet. 
His indifference allowed us to sleep. 

Cat, who made your ears bend back, 
who made you lazy as quick? 

Who made you work? 
It is a wonder any sun is left. 

Still it is always so abrupt. 
Sleep like an umbrella going up, 

clumsy like a broken umbrella coming down, 
this waking, and into what? 

I did not ask to be afraid. 
I did not ask for pleasure, but there it was, 

it exfoliated at its own leisure, 
grew until it was all that was-- 

The brief interruption of who I am 
interrupts and punctuates the day 

I always assumed that I would share-- 
Cat who cut the sun down from the sky 

and then responsible put it up again? 
There must be one of us that you prefer.

Night Without Sleep
 

The world's as the world is; the nations rearm and prepare to change; the age of tyrants returns; 
The greatest civilization that has ever existed builds itself higher towers on breaking foundations. 
Recurrent episodes; they were determined when the ape's children first ran in packs, chipped flint to an edge. 

I lie and hear dark rain beat the roof, and the blind wind. 

                                                                                       In the morning 
   perhaps I shall find strength again 
To value the immense beauty of this time of the world, the flowers of decay their pitiful loveliness, the fever-dream 
Tapestries that back the drama and are called the future. This ebb of vitality feels the ignoble and cruel 
Incidents, not the vast abstract order. 

                                                          I lie and hear dark rain beat the roof, and the night-blind wind. 

In the Ventana country darkness and rain and the roar of waters fill the deep mountain-throats. 
The creekside shelf of sand where we lay last August under a slip of stars 
And firelight played on the leaning gorge-walls, is drowned and lost. The deer of the country huddle on a ridge 
In a close herd under madrone-trees; they tremble when a rock-slide goes down, they open great darkness- 
Drinking eyes and press closer. 

                                              Cataracts of rock 
Rain down the mountain from cliff to cliff and torment the stream-bed. The stream deals with them. The laurels are wounded, 
Redwoods go down with their earth and lie thwart the gorge. I hear the torrent boulders battering each other, 
I feel the flesh of the mountain move on its bones in the wet darkness. 

                                                                                  Is this more beautiful 
Than man's disasters? These wounds will heal in their time; so will humanity's. This is more beautiful....at night....





Heart to Heart
 

It's neither red 
nor sweet. 
It doesn't melt 
or turn over, 
break or harden, 
so it can't feel 
pain, 
yearning, 
regret. 

It doesn't have 
a tip to spin on, 
it isn't even 
shapely--
just a thick clutch 
of muscle, 
lopsided, 
mute. Still, 
I feel it inside 
its cage sounding 
a dull tattoo: 
I want, I want--
but I can't open it: 
there's no key. 
I can't wear it 
on my sleeve, 
or tell you from 
the bottom of it 
how I feel. Here, 
it's all yours, now--
but you'll have 
to take me, 
too.





Fifth Grade Autobiography
 

I was four in this photograph fishing 
with my grandparents at a lake in Michigan. 
My brother squats in poison ivy. 
His Davy Crockett cap 
sits squared on his head so the raccoon tail 
flounces down the back of his sailor suit. 

My grandfather sits to the far right 
in a folding chair, 
and I know his left hand is on 
the tobacco in his pants pocket 
because I used to wrap it for him 
every Christmas. Grandmother's hips 
bulge from the brush, she's leaning 
into the ice chest, sun through the trees 
printing her dress with soft 
luminous paws. 

I am staring jealously at my brother; 
the day before he rode his first horse, alone. 
I was strapped in a basket 
behind my grandfather. 
He smelled of lemons. He's died--

but I remember his hands.





The Day is a Poem
 

(September 19, 1939)
This morning Hitler spoke in Danzig, we heard his voice. 
A man of genius: that is, of amazing 
Ability, courage, devotion, cored on a sick child's soul, 
Heard clearly through the dog-wrath, a sick child 
Wailing in Danzig; invoking destruction and wailing at it. 
Here, the day was extremely hot; about noon 
A south wind like a blast from hell's mouth spilled a slight rain 
On the parched land, and at five a light earthquake   
Danced the house, no harm done. To-night I have been amusing myself 
Watching the blood-red moon droop slowly   
Into black sea through bursts of dry lightning and distant thunder. 
Well: the day is a poem: but too much 
Like one of Jeffers's, crusted with blood and barbaric omens, 
Painful to excess, inhuman as a hawk's cry.





Oh Lovely Rock
 

We stayed the night in the pathless gorge of Ventana Creek, up the east fork. 
The rock walls and the mountain ridges hung forest on forest above our heads, maple and redwood, 
Laurel, oak, madrone, up to the high and slender Santa Lucian firs that stare up the cataracts 
Of slide-rock to the star-color precipices. 

                                                                  We lay on gravel and kept a little camp-fire for warmth. 
Past midnight only two or three coals glowed red in the cooling darkness; I laid a clutch of dead bay-leaves 
On the ember ends and felted dry sticks across them and lay down again. The revived flame 
Lighted my sleeping son's face and his companion's, and the vertical face of the great gorge-wall 
Across the stream. Light leaves overhead danced in the fire's breath, tree-trunks were seen: it was the rock wall 
That fascinated my eyes and mind. Nothing strange: light-gray diorite with two or three slanting seams in it, 
Smooth-polished by the endless attrition of slides and floods; no fern nor lichen, pure naked rock...as if I were 
Seeing rock for the first time. As if I were seeing through the flame-lit surface into the real and bodily 
And living rock. Nothing strange...I cannot 
Tell you how strange: the silent passion, the deep nobility and childlike loveliness: this fate going on 
Outside our fates. It is here in the mountain like a grave smiling child. I shall die, and my boys 
Will live and die, our world will go on through its rapid agonies of change and discovery; this age will die, 
And wolves have howled in the snow around a new Bethlehem: this rock will be here, grave, earnest, not passive: the energies 
That are its atoms will still be bearing the whole mountain above: and I, many packed centuries ago, 
Felt its intense reality with love and wonder, this lonely rock.





The Place for No Story
 

The coast hills at Sovranes Creek; 
No trees, but dark scant pasture drawn thin 
Over rock shaped like flame; 
The old ocean at the land's foot, the vast 
Gray extension beyond the long white violence; 
A herd of cows and the bull 
Far distant, hardly apparent up the dark slope; 
And the gray air haunted with hawks: 
This place is the noblest thing I have ever seen. No imaginable 
Human presence here could do anything 
But dilute the lonely self-watchful passion.





Hurt Hawks
 

I 

The broken pillar of the wing jags from the clotted shoulder, 
The wing trails like a banner in defeat, 
No more to use the sky forever but live with famine 
And pain a few days: cat nor coyote 
Will shorten the week of waiting for death, there is game without talons. 
He stands under the oak-bush and waits 
The lame feet of salvation; at night he remembers freedom 
And flies in a dream, the dawns ruin it. 
He is strong and pain is worse to the strong, incapacity is worse. 
The curs of the day come and torment him   
At distance, no one but death the redeemer will humble that head, 
The intrepid readiness, the terrible eyes. 
The wild God of the world is sometimes merciful to those 
That ask mercy, not often to the arrogant. 
You do not know him, you communal people, or you have forgotten him; 
Intemperate and savage, the hawk remembers him; 
Beautiful and wild, the hawks, and men that are dying, remember him. 


         II 

I'd sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk; but the great redtail 
Had nothing left but unable misery 
From the bones too shattered for mending, the wing that trailed under his talons when he moved. 
We had fed him for six weeks, I gave him freedom, 
He wandered over the foreland hill and returned in the evening, asking for death, 
Not like a beggar, still eyed with the old 
Implacable arrogance. I gave him the lead gift in the twilight. What fell was relaxed, 
Owl-downy, soft feminine feathers; but what 
Soared: the fierce rush: the night-herons by the flooded river cried fear at its rising 
Before it was quite unsheathed from reality.





Love the Wild Swan
 

"I hate my verses, every line, every word.   
Oh pale and brittle pencils ever to try 
One grass-blade's curve, or the throat of one bird 
That clings to twig, ruffled against white sky. 
Oh cracked and twilight mirrors ever to catch 
One color, one glinting flash, of the splendor of things. 
Unlucky hunter, Oh bullets of wax, 
The lion beauty, the wild-swan wings, the storm of the wings. 
--This wild swan of a world is no hunter's game. 
Better bullets than yours would miss the white breast, 
Better mirrors than yours would crack in the flame. 
Does it matter whether you hate your...self? At least 
Love your eyes that can see, your mind that can 
Hear the music, the thunder of the wings. Love the wild swan.





Tell the Bees
 

Tell the bees. They require news of the house; 
they must know, lest they sicken 
from the gap between their ignorance and our grief. 
Speak in a whisper. Tie a black swatch 
to a stick and attach the stick to their hive. 
From the fortress of casseroles and desserts 
built in the kitchen these past few weeks 
as though hunger were the enemy, remove 
a slice of cake and lay it where they can 
slowly draw it in, making a mournful sound. 

And tell the fly that has knocked on the window all day. 
Tell the redbird that rammed the glass from outside 
and stands too dazed to go. Tell the grass, 
though it's already guessed, and the ground clenched in furrows; 
tell the water you spill on the ground, 
then all the water will know. 
And the last shrunken pearl of snow in its hiding place. 

Tell the blighted elms, and the young oaks we plant instead. 
The water bug, while it scribbles 
a hundred lines that dissolve behind it. 
The lichen, while it etches deeper 
its single rune. The boulders, letting their fissures widen, 
the pebbles, which have no more to lose, 
the hills--they will be slightly smaller, as always, 

when the bees fly out tomorrow to look for sweetness 
and find their way 
because nothing else has changed.





The So-called Singer of Nab
 

They have left behind the established cave 
with its well-worn floor. Scholarship impels them 
in hundreds, but generally one by one, 
to find an unknown passage or scrape out their own. 
Proto-Semitic linguistic theory, 
Hittite stratigraphic anomalies, 
microclimatic economics. "What do you see?" 
invisible followers ask in their ears, 
and they whisper "Wonderful things" as they quarry 
a grain of rock at a time, or examine 
a fleck of ore, or measure 
the acidity of a trickle of water. 
See! Behold! Look! Lo! 
they cry in season, rapt, in love, 
chipping away with their pocketknives, 
pencils, rulers, fingernails, 
but some have tunneled so narrowly and deep 
that those behind see nothing but slivers of light 
around an excavator's haunches. 

A battered piece of a tablet is all that remains 
of the so-called Singer of Nab. 
Circa 1200 BCE, 
he impressed, or had impressed, some words in clay. 
He may have composed a religious hymn, 
praise to the king, a poem of love, 
an inventory of cattle. (He may have been she, 
but this is unlikely.) The lines we have 
could be the beginning or the middle; 
there may have been ten more, or hundreds. 
The word before this gap, in fact, means "hundreds." 
Hundreds led in battle, hundreds slain? 
A thousand times beloved, nine hundred sheep? 
And the standard translation of this word, here, 
is either "desire" or "need." But did he write 
of a boundless yearning, or mercantile requirements? 
Was he a "singer"? The scholars who care disagree. 

Look at them, crouched in a long tunnel dug 
by means of argument over an antique syntax, 
warming their hands at a chunk of brick 
baked maybe in the time of the Trojan War, 
broken some moment between then and now-- 
peering at it with penlights, squandering eyesight. 
They know they may crawl out hungry, mumbling, 
aged and gray, clutching a secret message of small import 
or nothing, nothing. They seem lost. They seem happy.





Elegy for the Quagga
 

Krakatau split with a blinding noise 
and raised from gutted, steaming rock 
a pulverized black sky, over water walls 
that swiftly fell on Java and Sumatra. 
Fifteen days before, in its cage in Amsterdam, 
the last known member of Equus quagga, 
the southernmost subspecies of zebra, died. 
Most of the wild ones, not wild enough, 
grazing near the Cape of Good Hope, 
had been shot and skinned and roasted by white hunters. 

When a spider walked on cooling Krakatau's skin, 
no quagga walked anywhere. While seeds 
pitched by long winds onto newborn fields 
burst open and rooted, perhaps some thistle 
flourished on the quagga's discarded innards. 
The fractured island greened and hummed again; 
handsome zebras tossed their heads 
in zoos, on hired safari plains. 
Who needs to hear a quagga's voice? 
Or see the warm hide twitch away a fly, 

see the neck turn, curving its cream and chestnut stripes 
that run down to plain dark haunches and plain white legs? 
A kind of horse. Less picturesque than a dodo. Still, 
we mourn what we mourn. 
Even if, when it sank to its irreplaceable knees, 
when its unique throat closed behind a sigh, 
no dust rose to redden a whole year's sunsets, 
no one unwittingly busy 
two thousand miles away jumped at the sound, 
no ashes rained on ships in the merciless sea.





Unreliable Narration
 

Of Mina-sarpilili-anda II, 
the only surviving record 
is this splendid bas-relief in which 
he presses the neck of his Hittite foe 
beneath one battle-shod foot 
while minions shoulder the spoils 
of a conquered city. 

                                                                   In fact 
there was no war that year; a bored stone-carver 
was looking for preferment. He received 
an allowance of good wine. 
In a perfumed cloud of dust 
that loitered over the plain, 
Hittite ambassadors came to the king 
with golden bells and rosewater candy, 
birds in cages and spotted cats, 
and departed in peace. The king was beloved, 
laughed often, feared nothing, and died in his bed 
of poison. 

                                  A carnelian image 
of his second-best wife, 
accurate to the last mole, was plucked 
from the dirt by a boy tending goats, sold, 
and spirited out of the country, rolled in a rug, 
on a ship that sank on a cloudless day. 
An image of his first wife, in chrysoprase, 
lies tightly packed in buried rubble 
for the next generation of archaeologists-- 
should they prove worthy, 
persistent, 
and slyer than goatherds. 






Makris Is Fallen
 

The dog came back, 
grinning and smelling of carrion, 
and her husband behind it, stride and gestures 
too large for the house. His field voice, cracking, 
declared a wider kingdom, 
and the name of a fallen city, 
not theirs this time. 
From outside the roar and shrill 
of celebration poured in. 
He drew near in a rank cloud, breathing hard, 
to show her the gash in his thumb. 
So she washed in five waters and went to their bed, 
but he slept without moving, 
still in his cloak and dust.





Stubbornly
 

For RLB
Pass by the showy rose, 
blabbing open, 
suckling a shiny beetle; 

pass by the changeless diamond 
that falls asleep in shadow-- 

this love is a lichen, 

alga and fungus made one fleck, 
feeding on what it feeds, 

growing slightly faster than stone 
into a patch of gray lace, 
a double thumbprint, 

its bloom distinguishable, with practice, 
from its dormant phase, 

crocheting its singular habit 
over time, a faithful stain 
bound to its home, 

etching on the unmoved rock 
the only rune it knows.





Zucchini Shofar
 

No animals were harmed in the making of this joyful noise: 
A thick, twisted stem from the garden 
is the wedding couple's ceremonial ram's horn. 
Its substance will not survive one thousand years, 
nor will the garden, which is today their temple, 
nor will their names, nor their union now announced 
with ritual blasts upon the zucchini shofar. 
Shall we measure blessings by their duration? 
Through the narrow organic channel fuzzily come 
the prescribed sustained notes, short notes, rests. 
All that rhythm requires. Among their talents, 
the newlyweds excel at making 
and serving mustard-green soup and molasses cookies, 
and taking nieces and nephews for walks in the woods. 
The gardener dyes eggs with onion skins, 
wraps presents, tells stories, finds the best seashells; 
his friends adore his paper-cuttings-- 
"Nothing I do will last," he says. 
What is this future approval we think we need; 
who made passing time our judge? 
Do we want butter that endures for ages, 
or butter that melts into homemade cornbread now? 
--the note that rings in my deaf ear without ceasing, 
or two voices abashed by the vows they undertake? 
This moment's chord of earthly commotion 
will never be struck exactly so again-- 
though love does love to repeat its favorite lines. 
So let the shofar splutter its slow notes and quick notes, 
let the nieces and nephews practice their flutes and trombones, 
let living room pianos invite unwashed hands, 
let glasses of different fullness be tapped for their different notes, 
let everyone learn how to whistle, 
let the girl dawdling home from her trumpet lesson 
pause at the half-built house on the corner, 
where the newly installed maze of plumbing comes down 
to one little pipe whose open end she can reach, 
so she takes a deep breath 
and makes the whole house sound.





How to Cook a Wolf
 

If your mother's like mine wanting you honeyed and blithe   
                   you'll get cooked by getting evicted   

since the mothers can teach with a dustpan the tons of modes of tossing. 

And the fathers will lift your eyes too-early-too-open:   
                   the fathers can creep up on anything when it's still too wet   

to cloister with their weeping and strand you like a seed   

or cook at the carnivals with the can-do caroling   
                   and storefronts and foodstuffs and annulments and Scotch   

and off-handed fucking and walking out and moving on   

until they're cooking the drift of you wanting a whole bayou up in you   
                   and cooking and cooking the gist   

of you needing your crannies hot with a good man's body-silt   

until your head is stuffed with a pining for diapers 
                   and the most minuscule spoons made mostly of silver   

and Ajax too and Minwax Oh 

in this the dumbstruck story of the American female 
                   as a cut of terracotta and some kindling in a dress   

while howling at the marrow of the marrow of the bone.





Uncouplings
 

There is no I in teamwork 
but there is a two maker 

there is no I in together 
but there is a got three 
a get to her 

the I in relationship 
is the heart I slip on 
a lithe prison 

in all communication 
we count on a mimic 
(I am not uncomic) 

our listening skills 
are silent killings 

there is no we in marriage 
but a grim area 

there is an I in family 
also my fail





The Invisible Birds of Central America
 

For Alicia
The bird who creaks like a rusty playground swing 
the bird who sharpens the knife         the bird who blows 
on the mouths of milk bottles         the bird who bawls like a cat 
like a cartoon baby         the bird who rubs the wineglass 
the bird who curlicues         the bird who quacks like a duck 
but is not a duck         the bird who pinks on a jeweller's hammer 
They hide behind the sunlight scattered throughout the canopy 
At the thud of your feet they fall thoughtful and quiet 
coming to life again only when you have passed 
Perhaps they are not multiple         but one 
a many-mooded trickster         whose voice is rich 
and infinitely various         whose feathers 
liquify the rainbow         rippling scarlet 
emerald indigo         whose streaming tail 
is rare as a comet's         a single glimpse of which 
is all that you could wish for         the one thing 
missing         to make your eyes at last feel full 
to meet this wild need of yours         for wonder





Honorary Jew
 

The first year, I grated potatoes, chopped onions 
& watched. The second year, I fed all but the eggs 

into the machine & said I'll do the latkes & did, 
my pile of crisp delights borne to the feast by the wife 

who baffled me, our books closed, banter hushed,   
money useless in the apartment--house, my in-laws called it, 

new-wave thump at one end, ganja reek at the other-- 
in which she'd knelt to tell the no one who listened 

no more no      no more no     a three-year-old mouthing 
the essential prayer. The uncle made rich by a song 

stacked three & dug in, talking critics & Koch-- 
everyone crunching now, slathering applesauce, slurping tea-- 

talking Rabin & Mehitabel, radio & Durrell, 
how a song is a poem or it isn't a song 

& vice-versa. Done, he pointed a greasy finger 
at me, said You can't be a goy. You--I say it 

for all to hear--are an honorary Jew!  
which, impossible dream, my latkes lived up to 

for five more years. Then the wailing.   
Then the dust.





Appleblossom
 

When History turns soldiers into battles, you turn them into grass. 
Bash, Sweet, is it honorable? But for these men who died with grunts 
and clangs in their ears, for their horses with snapped legs, I haven't got 
the art to make them into anything. I fold the grass in the shape   
of a man, very literal, very primitive and leave it on   
the field and say, "Forgive me valorous men for my ineptitude.
Just then, the little man falls down in the wind and--huh!--there is art.

Appleblossom
 

Difficult shacks of Kushiro, too far afield, at least theirs are not 
our roofless griefs even farther in the marshes that are huge buckets 
of green tea in the rainy season--you glisten as you go, Bash,   
wring out your sleeves. Frog keeps its knees in its armpits on plant flotilla   
and Duck of all the birds is shaped most like a canoe. We were not built   
for this and anyway, standing smack dab in no-man's-land you can stop   
and say, Here is a place made famous in poems. Aren't you such a place?

Appleblossom
 

Clamber out of the morning river with water beads like fish eggs clung 
to your pubis the calluses on your buttocks from sitting, writing 
on flat rocks, your goose-pimpled thighs--the bumpy tongues of two dogs licking   
each other--and river-slather and slather at the edge of my mouth. 

You are smiling, straining out your hair, flicking your hands, and then 
see me watching you with the cloth and pots I was taking to wash. 
Before I have time to be embarrassed, the smile lifts into your eyes.

Appleblossom
 

Bash, with your grass pillow, what underground sounds come into your dreams? 
Do blue-horned beetles scratch against the starless night sky that lines your head 
with the starless night skies of their own domed backs? Do centipedes trickle through? 
Do worms burrow with their snouts, with their bodies that are entirely snouts? 
Snoozer, I can only ask you this because now you are dead asleep: 
Do I ever appear as a nightcrawler whispering in your ear? 
Are the words, "I love you, as soft as the cough of a good luck cricket?

Appleblossom (Leaving Edo)
 

I have a need to ventilate, to have my porous body--sockets   
and holes--open to the bald-faced wind and have my heathen   inner-stuff   
tweedled like a reed flute and this piffle floats out. But walking on the   
open road, I know even open roads, to be roads at all, are ruts.    

With a careless beanfield on either side, off one more time, even you,   
Mr. Out-in-the-Woods, might as well be stuffed in your hometown bucket.    
And if these grim beams of trees are truly home, Sweet, as you say they are,   
then the timberwolves would reclaim you by singing and that would be all. 
The Moon would reclaim the timberwolves--not a snarl--soft keepsakes   
asleep in the palm of Her hand. I would reclaim the Moon by picking   
a white silk chrysanthemum and resting it on the branch beside Her.    
Who would reclaim me? and say, "Blossom, we are not two. There is no road   
to or from. You cannot write a love poem. You cannot walk away.

courthouse steps
 

to say no more of art than that it makes, by its very distraction 
                     a mode of abiding 



accordingly, its variations:    each type of thread-and-piecework   
                     named double engagement ring, log cabin, or broken dishes    
all built on the same geometric figures-- 
                                        precise interception of angle and line 



so too each tale of love is rooted in that first tale:    the poet 
                     descending to the underworld 
                                        finally granted his shade, who'll follow him 
only to disappear again.      perhaps one version has them reunite 
                     affixed in their solo chromospheres the stars, which,   
to the human eye, appear to overlap 



substanceless love 
                                        immune at last to gravity and time-- 



in texas (I might as well recount this as a story) there's a town 
                     with a courthouse built on concrete and twisted iron 
edified in red granite, capitals & architrave of red sandstone   

with point and punch, a carver broached the effigy of his muse 
                     he rendered her attractive features, down to the very blush 

                                          of course she spurned him,   
                  of course there was another to whom she turned 
love should not be written in stone but written in water 
                                        (I paraphrase the latin of catullus) 


the sculptor carried on:    not just the face of his beloved   
                     but the face of her other lover: 
                                        snaggle-toothed, wart-peppered, pudgy 
them both, made into ugly caricatures of themselves, as wanton 
                     as the carver perceived them, and as lewd 



                     well, craze and degenerate and crack:   the portraits hold 
though, long since, the participants have dwindled into dirt 
          
                     beautiful.      unbeautiful.      each with an aspect of exactness 



tread light upon this pedestal.      dream instead of a time before 
                     your love disfigured, a time 
                                        withstanding even crass, wind-beaten time itself





Hospital parking lot, April
 

Once there was a woman who laughed for years uncontrollably after a stroke. 

Once there was a child who woke after surgery to find his parents were impostors. 

These seagulls above the parking lot today, made of hurricane and ether, they 

have flown directly out of the brain wearing little blue-gray masks, like strangers' faces, full 

of wingd mania, like television in waiting rooms. Entertainment. Pain. The rage 

of fruit trees in April, and your car, which I parked in a shadow before you died, decorated now with feathers,   

and unrecognizable   
with the windows unrolled   
and the headlights on   
and the engine still running   
in the Parking Space of the Sun.





After Ken Burns
 

The beautiful plate I cracked in half as I wrapped it in tissue paper-- 
as if the worship of a thing might be the thing that breaks it. 

This river, which is life, which is wayfaring. This river,   
which is also sky. This dipper, full of mind, which is   

not only the hysterical giggling of girls, but the trembling   
of the elderly. Not only   

the scales, beaks, and teeth of creatures, but also   
their imaginative names (elephant, peacock) and their   
love of one another, the excited   
preparations they sometimes make   
for their own deaths. 

It is as if some graceful goddess, wandering in the dark, desperate with thirst, bent down and dropped that dipper   
clumsily in this river. It floated away. Consciousness, memory, sensory information, the historians and their glorious war . . . 
The pineal gland, tiny pinecone in the forehead, our third eye:   Of course   

it will happen here. No doubt. Someday, here,   

in this little house,   
they will lay the wounded side by side. The blood 
will run into the basement through the boards. Their ghosts are already here, along   
with the cracked plate wrapped in old paper in the attic,   

and the woman who will turn one day at the window to see   
a long strange line of vehicles traveling slowly toward her door, which 

she opens (what choice does she have?) although she has not yet been born.





In the Drink
 

He would have gone to Hell ageine, and earnest sute did make: But Charon would not suffer him to passe the Stygian lake. --Ovid, Metamorphoses (Tr. by Arthur Golding)
Never mind phantom forms, the Keaton-crash 
that dumped us in that sea-fed swamp, 
the Dutch kill, Latin nihil, thing without 
opposite--attend instead the transcendent, 

the flying, for god's sake, what we saw 
the moment before we thwocked overboard:   
a heron stutter-flapped and lifted off, 
clumsy as a wind-mauled tarp at first, 

but couth beyond sublime once clear 
of cattail punks and saltgrass tips,   
the overturned rowboat's rusted hull.   
Or the cormorant that plunked and dipped,   

rose flipping fish from beak to tongue   
and down its neck, water beading on its head. 
But the crown that really pleased the crowd 
my maiden voyage was iridescent green,   

brilliantined, a merganser's spiky coxcomb. 
He swam right by, chasing red herrings 
and cackling so happily I had to pull 
a feather from his cap. And so I surfaced 

solo. I tell myself, I only launch the bark,   
I never book the seats. I didn't stop 
to spin the prop or wipe the rail, just tipped   
the motor up and paddle-poled, bottom- 

stirred. Rousted horseshoe crabs, sleeping   
ducks, cranky grebes, slapped along 
the little waves, the seeping tide, lonelier, sure, 
indignant, too--what better lover 

has plucked and boasted, over what better lyre? 
An open boat: it's company, not coin, I want.   
I'll tune the wake to silence, court grace, make change-- 
still trading on the laughs I've jerry-rigged.





Left to Itself the Heart Could Almost Melt, Mend
 

When the Amish girl gets off the bus 
she walks over and stomps 
her small black boot into a drift 
in front of McDonald's.    
She is maybe new to winter   
this far north and wants to know   
its depth. Its give. Oh,   
be careful. It already has you   
by the night of your dress,   
violet-black with white-dotted print.





Sad and Alone
 

Well, this is nothing new, nothing 
to rattle the rafters in the noggin, 

this moment of remembering 
and its kissing cousin the waking dream. 

I wonder if I'll remember it? 
I've had a vision of a woman 

reclining underneath a tree: 
she's about half naked and little by little 

I'm sprinkling her burial mounds 
with grass. This is the kind of work 

I like. It lets me remember, and so 
I do. I remember the time I laid 

my homemade banjo in the fire 
and let it burn. There was nothing else 

to burn and the house was cold; 
the cigar box curled inside the flames. 

But the burst of heat was over soon, 
and once the little roar was done, 

I could hear the raindrops plopping up 
the buckets and kettles, scattered out 

like little ponds around the room. 
It was night and I was a boy, alone 

and left to listen to that old music. 
I liked it. I've liked it ever since. 

I loved the helpless people I loved. 
That's what a little boy will do, 

but a grown man will turn it all 
to sadness and let it soak his heart 

until he wrings it out and dreams 
about another kind of love, 

some afternoon beneath a tree. 
Burial mounds--that's hilarious.





A Good Fish
 

Jerk that bitch, urges my guide,   
and I give my shuddering pole 
a jerk, hooking the throat 
of the first steelhead of my life. 
Reel 'em, he mutters and revs the motor. 
I horse my pole and reel and horse. 
The boat's mascot whines, her claws 
clicking. Let it take some line. 
My father, uncle, and cousin 
are reeling. First fish! they shout, 
and I shout, What a fighter! 
A silver spine touches the air.   
There, he points, a hen. And guess what? 
She's gonna join the club, 
somehow spotting in that glimpse 
the smooth place along her back   
where a fin had been snipped.   
He leans over the gunwale, dips a net, 
and scoops her into the boat.   
She is thick with a wide band   
of fiery scales, slap- 
slapping the aluminum bottom. 
Welcome to the club, he says, 
and clobbers her once, and again, 
and once more before she goes still. 
A bleeder, he says, shaking his head 
and handing her to me. I curl 
a finger through a gill the way 
you're supposed to, determined 
not to let her slip and flop 
back to the river, a blunder 
I'd never live down. A good fist. 
Fish, I mean. A good fish.





Small Moth
 

She's slicing ripe white peaches 
into the Tony the Tiger bowl 
and dropping slivers for the dog 
poised vibrating by her foot to stop their fall 
when she spots it, camouflaged, 
a glimmer and then full on-- 
happiness, plashing blunt soft wings 
inside her as if it wants 
to escape again.





Snow Becoming Light by Morning
 

In case you sit across from the meteorologist tonight, 
and in case the dim light over the booth in the bar still shines 
almost planetary on your large, smooth, winter-softened 
forehead, in case all of the day--its woods and play, its fire-- 
has stayed on your beard, and will stay through the slight 
drift of mouth, the slackening of even your heart's muscle-- 
 . . . well. I am filled with snow. There's nothing to do now 
but wait.





Tom O Bedlam among the Sunflowers
 

To have gold in your back yard and not know it. . . 
I woke this morning before your dream had shredded 
And found a curious thing: flowers made of gold, 

Six-sided--more than that--broken on flagstones, 
Petals the color of a wedding band. 
You are sleeping. The morning comes up gold. 

Perhaps I made those flowers in my head, 
For I have counted snowflakes in July 
Blowing across my eyes like bits of calcium, 

And I have stepped into your dream at night, 
A stranger there, my body steeped in moonlight. 
I watched you tremble, washed in all that silver. 

Love, the stars have fallen into the garden 
And turned to frost. They have opened like a hand. 
It is the color that breaks out of the bedsheets. 

This morning the garden is littered with dry petals 
As yellow as the page of an old book.   
I step among them. They are brittle as bone china.





[Of a girl, in white]
 

          
          Of a girl, in white, between the lines, in the spaces where nothing is written. Her starched petticoats, giving him the slip. Loose lips, a telltale spot, where she was kissed, and told. Who would believe her, lying still between the sheets. The pillow cases, the dirty laundry laundered. Pillow talk-show on a leather couch, slips in and out of dreams. Without permission, slips out the door. A name adores a Freudian slip.
        




[Kills bugs dead.]
 

          
          Kills bugs dead. Redundancy is syntactical overkill. A pin-prick of peace at the end of the tunnel of a nightmare night in a roach motel. Their noise infects the dream. In black kitchens they foul the food, walk on our bodies as we sleep over oceans of pirate flags. Skull and crossbones, they crunch like candy. When we die they will eat us, unless we kill them first. Invest in better mousetraps. Take no prisoners on board ship, to rock the boat, to violate our beds with pestilence. We dream the dream of extirpation. Wipe out a species, with God at our side. Annihilate the insects. Sterilize the filthy vermin.

The Arrival
 

Luggage first, the lining of his suit jacket dangling 
As always, just when you'd given up hope 
Nimbly he backs out of the taxi 

Eyes nervously extending, like brave crabs 
Everywhere at once, keeping track of his papers 
He pilots himself into the home berth 

Like a small tug in a cloud of seagulls 
Worries flutter around him so thick 
It takes him some time to arrive 

And you wonder if he's ever really been happy: 
When the blue eyes blur 
And stare out to sea 

Whether it's only a daydream 
Or a long pain that silences him 
In such gray distances 

You'll never know, but now 
Turning to you, the delicate mouth 
Like a magician 

Is curious, sensitive, playing tricks, 
Pouting like a wise turtle 
It seems he has a secret 

With the driver, 
With the stewardess on the airplane 
So that even when he opens his arms 

When the warm voice surrounds you, 
Wraps you in rough bliss, 
Just before you go under 

Suddenly you remember: 
The beloved does not come 
From nowhere: out of himself, alone 

Often he comes slowly, carefully 
After a long taxi ride 
Past many beautiful men and women 

And many dead bodies, 
Mysterious and important companions.





The Jew and the Rooster Are One
 

After fighting with his dead brothers and his dead sisters 
he chose to paint the dead rooster of his youth, 
thinking God wouldn't mind a rooster, would he?--or thinking 
a rooster would look good in a green armchair 
with flecks of blood on his breast and thighs, his wings 
resting a little, their delicate bones exposed, a 
few of the plumes in blue against the yellow 
naked body, all of those feathers plucked 
as if by a learned butcher, and yet the head 
hanging down, the comb disgraced, the mouth 
open as if for screaming, the right front chair leg, 
seen from a certain angle, either a weapon 
or a strong right arm, a screaming arm, the arm 
of an agitator; and yet at the same time the chair 
as debonair as any, the brown mahogany 
polished, the carving nineteenth century, the velvet 
green, an old velour, as if to match 
the plumes a little, a blue with a green. No rabbi 
was present, this he knew, and no dead butcher 
had ever been there with his burnished knife 
and his bucket of sand; this was the angry rooster 
that strutted from one small house to another, that scratched 
among the rhubarb, he is the one who stopped 
as if he were thinking, he is upside down now 
and plucked. It looks as if his eye can hardly 
contain that much of sorrow, as if it wanted 
to disappear, and it looks as if his legs 
were almost helpless, and though his body was huge 
compared to the armchair, it was only more 
horrible that way, and though his wings were lifted 
it wasn't for soaring, it was more for bedragglement 
and degradation. Whatever else there was 
of memory there had to be revenge in there, 
even revenge on himself, for he had to be 
the rooster, though that was easy, he was the armchair 
too, and he was the butcher, it was a way 
to understand, there couldn't be another, he had to 
paint like that, he has to scrape the skin 
and put the blotches on, and though it was 
grotesque to put a dead rooster in an armchair 
his table could have been full, or he just liked 
the arrangement, or he was good at painting a chair 
and it was done first--although I doubt it--or someone 
brought him the bird--a kind of gift--for food was 
cheap then, and roosters were easy to cook; but it was 
more than anything else a kind of Tartar, 
a kind of Jew, he was painting, something 
that moved from Asia to Europe, something furious, 
ill and dreamy, something that stood in the mud 
beside a large wooden building and stared at a cloud, 
it was so deep in thought, and it had tears 
in a way, there was no getting around that kind 
of thinking even if he stood in the middle of the room 
holding his paintbrush like a thumb at arm's length 
closing one of his eyes he still was standing 
in the mud shrieking, he still was dying for corn, 
he still was golden underneath his feathers 
with freckles of blood, for he was a ripped-open Jew, 
and organs all on show, the gizzard, the liver, 
for he was a bleeding Tartar, and he was a Frenchman 
dying on the way to Paris and he was 
tethered to a table, he was slaughtered.





Another Insane Devotion
 

This was gruesome--fighting over a ham sandwich 
with one of the tiny cats of Rome, he leaped 
on my arm and half hung on to the food and half 
hung on my shirt and coat. I tore it apart 
and let him have his portion, I think I lifted him 
down, sandwich and all, on the sidewalk and sat 
with my own sandwich beside him, maybe I petted 
his bony head and felt him shiver. I have 
told this story over and over; some things 
root in the mind; his boldness, of course, was frightening 
and unexpected--his stubbornness--though hunger 
drove him mad. It was the breaking of boundaries, 
the sudden invasion, but not only that, it was 
the sharing of food and the sharing of space; he didn't 
run into an alley or into a cellar, 
he sat beside me, eating, and I didn't run 
into a trattoria, say, shaking,   
with food on my lips and blood on my cheek, sobbing; 
but not only that, I had gone there to eat 
and wait for someone. I had maybe an hour 
before she would come and I was full of hope 
and excitement. I have resisted for years 
interpreting this, but now I think I was given 
a clue, or I was giving myself a clue, 
across the street from the glass sandwich shop.   
That was my last night with her, the next day 
I would leave on the train for Paris and she would 
meet her husband. Thirty-five years ago 
I ate my sandwich and moaned in her arms, we were 
dying together; we never met again 
although she was pregnant when I left her--I have 
a daughter or son somewhere, darling grandchildren   
in Norwich, Connecticut, or Canton, Ohio. 
Every five years I think about her again 
and plan on looking her up. The last time 
I was sitting in New Brunswick, New Jersey, 
and heard that her husband was teaching at Princeton, 
if she was still married, or still alive, and tried   
calling. I went that far. We lived 
in Florence and Rome. We rowed in the bay of Naples 
and floated, naked, on the boards. I started 
to think of her again today. I still 
am horrified by that cat's hunger. I still 
am puzzled by the connection. This is another 
insane devotion, there must be hundreds, although 
it isn't just that, there is no pain, and the thought 
is fleeting and sweet. I think it's my own dumb boyhood, 
walking around with Slavic cheeks and burning 
stupid eyes. I think I gave the cat 
half of my sandwich to buy my life, I think 
I broke it in half as a decent sacrifice. 
It was this I bought, the red coleus, 
the split rocking chair, the silk lampshade. 
Happiness. I watched him with pleasure.   
I bought memory. I could have lost it.   
How crazy it sounds. His face twisted with cunning. 
The wind blowing through his hair. His jaws working.





Emergency Haying
 

Coming home with the last load I ride standing 
on the wagon tongue, behind the tractor 
in hot exhaust, lank with sweat, 

my arms strung 
awkwardly along the hayrack, cruciform. 
Almost 500 bales we've put up 

this afternoon, Marshall and I. 
And of course I think of another who hung 
like this on another cross. My hands are torn 

by baling twine, not nails, and my side is pierced 
by my ulcer, not a lance. The acid in my throat 
is only hayseed. Yet exhaustion and the way 

my body hangs from twisted shoulders, suspended 
on two points of pain in the rising 
monoxide, recall that greater suffering. 

Well, I change grip and the image 
fades. It's been an unlucky summer. Heavy rains 
brought on the grass tremendously, a monster crop, 

but wet, always wet. Haying was long delayed. 
Now is our last chance to bring in 
the winter's feed, and Marshall needs help. 

We mow, rake, bale, and draw the bales 
to the barn, these late, half-green, 
improperly cured bales; some weigh 150 pounds 

or more, yet must be lugged by the twine 
across the field, tossed on the load, and then 
at the barn unloaded on the conveyor 

and distributed in the loft. I help-- 
I, the desk-servant, word-worker-- 
and hold up my end pretty well too; but God, 

the close of day, how I fall down then. My hands 
are sore, they flinch when I light my pipe. 
I think of those who have done slave labor, 

less able and less well prepared than I. 
Rose Marie in the rye fields of Saxony, 
her father in the camps of Moldavia 

and the Crimea, all clerks and housekeepers 
herded to the gaunt fields of torture. Hands 
too bloodied cannot bear 

even the touch of air, even 
the touch of love. I have a friend 
whose grandmother cut cane with a machete 

and cut and cut, until one day 
she snicked her hand off and took it 
and threw it grandly at the sky. Now 

in September our New England mountains 
under a clear sky for which we're thankful at last 
begin to glow, maples, beeches, birches 

in their first color. I look 
beyond our famous hayfields to our famous hills, 
to the notch where the sunset is beginning, 

then in the other direction, eastward, 
where a full new-risen moon like a pale 
medallion hangs in a lavender cloud 

beyond the barn. My eyes 
sting with sweat and loveliness. And who 
is the Christ now, who 

if not I? It must be so. My strength 
is legion. And I stand up high 
on the wagon tongue in my whole bones to say 

woe to you, watch out 
you sons of bitches who would drive men and women 
to the fields where they can only die.





Notes on Poverty
 

Was I so poor 
      in those damned days 
that I went in the dark 
      in torn shoes 
and furtiveness 
      to steal fat ears 
of cattle corn 
      from the good cows 
and pound them 
      like hard maize 
on my worn Aztec 
      stone? I was.





Scrambled Eggs and Whiskey
 

Scrambled eggs and whiskey 
in the false-dawn light. Chicago, 
a sweet town, bleak, God knows, 
but sweet. Sometimes. And 
weren't we fine tonight? 
When Hank set up that limping 
treble roll behind me 
my horn just growled and I 
thought my heart would burst. 
And Brad M. pressing with the 
soft stick, and Joe-Anne 
singing low. Here we are now 
in the White Tower, leaning 
on one another, too tired 
to go home. But don't say a word, 
don't tell a soul, they wouldn't 
understand, they couldn't, never 
in a million years, how fine, 
how magnificent we were 
in that old club tonight.





Rain on Tin
 

If I ever get over the bodies of women, I am going to think of the rain, 
of waiting under the eaves of an old house 
at that moment 
when it takes a form like fog. 
It makes the mountain vanish. 
Then the smell of rain, which is the smell of the earth a plow turns up, 
only condensed and refined. 
Almost fifty years since thunder rolled 
and the nerves woke like secret agents under the skin. 
Brazil is where I wanted to live. 
The border is not far from here. 
Lonely and grateful would be my way to end, 
and something for the pain please, 
a little purity to sand the rough edges, 
a slow downpour from the Dark Ages, 
a drizzle from the Pleistocene. 
As I dream of the rain's long body, 
I will eliminate from mind all the qualities that rain deletes 
and then I will be primed to study rain's power, 
the first drops lightly hallowing, 
but now and again a great gallop of the horse of rain 
or an explosion of orange-green light. 
A simple radiance, it requires no discipline. 
Before I knew women, I knew the lonely pleasures of rain. 
The mist and then the clearing. 
I will listen where the lightning thrills the rooster up a willow, 
and my whole life flowing 
until I have no choice, only the rain, 
and I step into it.





Sitting with Others
 

The front seats filled last. Laggards, buffoons, 
and kiss-ups falling in beside local politicos, 
the about to be honored, and the hard of hearing. 

No help from the middle, blenders and criminals. 
And the back rows: restless, intelligent, unable to commit. 
My place was always left-center, a little to the rear. 

The shy sat with me, fearful of discovery. 
Behind me the dead man's illegitimate children 
and the bride's and groom's former lovers. 

There, when lights were lowered, hands 
plunged under skirts or deftly unzipped flies, 
and, lights up again, rose and pattered in applause. 

Ahead, the bored practiced impeccable signatures. 
But was it a movie or a singing? I remember 
the whole crowd uplifted, but not the event 

or the word that brought us together as one-- 
One, I say now, when I had felt myself many, 
speaking and listening: that was the contradiction.





The Mosquito
 

I see the mosquito kneeling on the soft underside of my arm, kneeling 
Like a fruitpicker, kneeling like an old woman 
With the proboscis of her prayer buried in the idea of God, 
And I know we shall not speak with the aliens 
And that peace will not happen in my life, not unless 
It is in the burnt oil spreading across the surfaces of ponds, in the dark 
Egg rafts clotting and the wiggletails expiring like batteries. 
Bring a little alcohol and a little balm 
For these poppies planted by the Queen of Neptune. 
In her photographs she is bearded and spurred, embellished five hundred times, 
Her modular legs crouching, her insufferable head unlocking 
To lower the razor-edge of its tubes, and she is there in the afternoon 
When the wind gives up the spirit of cleanliness 
And there rises from the sound the brackish oyster and squid smell of creation. 
I lie down in the sleeping bag sodden with rain. 
Nights with her, I am loved for myself, for the succulent 
Flange of my upper lip, the twin bellies of my eyelids. 
She adores the easy, the soft. She picks the tenderest blossoms of insomnia. 
Mornings while the jackhammer rips the pavement outside my window, 
While the sanitation workers bang the cans against the big truck and shout to each other over the motor, 
I watch her strut like an udder with my blood, 
Imagining the luminous pick descending into Trotsky's skull and the eleven days 
I waited for the cold chill, nightmare, and nightsweat of malaria; 
Imagining the mating call in the vibrations of her wings, 
And imagining, in the simple knot of her ganglia, 
How she thrills to my life, how she sings for the harvest.





Anne Rutledge
 

Out of me unworthy and unknown 
The vibrations of deathless music; 
"With malice toward none, with charity for all. 
Out of me the forgiveness of millions toward millions, 
And the beneficent face of a nation 
Shining with justice and truth. 
I am Anne Rutledge who sleep beneath these weeds, 
Beloved in life of Abraham Lincoln, 
Wedded to him, not through union, 
But through separation. 
Bloom forever, O Republic, 
From the dust of my bosom! 







Lincoln
 

Would I might rouse the Lincoln in you all, 
That which is gendered in the wilderness 
From lonely prairies and God's tenderness. 
Imperial soul, star of a weedy stream, 
Born where the ghosts of buffaloes still dream, 
Whose spirit hoof-beats storm above his grave, 
Above that breast of earth and prairie-fire-- 
Fire that freed the slave. 







A Farmer Remembers Lincoln
 

"Lincoln?-- 
Well, I was in the old Second Maine, 
The first regiment in Washington from the Pine Tree State. 
Of course I didn't get the butt of the clip; 
We was there for guardin' Washington-- 
We was all green. 

"I ain't never ben to the theayter in my life-- 
I didn't know how to behave. 
I ain't never ben since. 
I can see as plain as my hat the box where he sat in 
When he was shot. 
I can tell you, sir, there was a panic 
When we found our President was in the shape he was in! 
Never saw a soldier in the world but what liked him. 

"Yes, sir. His looks was kind o' hard to forget. 
He was a spare man, 
An old farmer. 
Everything was all right, you know, 
But he wasn't a smooth-appearin' man at all-- 
Not in no ways; 
Thin-faced, long-necked, 
And a swellin' kind of a thick lip like. 

"And he was a jolly old fellow--always cheerful; 
He wasn't so high but the boys could talk to him their own ways. 
While I was servin' at the Hospital 
He'd come in and say, You look nice in here,' 
Praise us up, you know. 
And he'd bend over and talk to the boys-- 
And he'd talk so good to 'em--so close-- 
That's why I call him a farmer. 
I don't mean that everything about him wasn't all right, you understand, 
It's just--well, I was a farmer-- 
And he was my neighbor, anybody's neighbor. 
I guess even you young folks would a' liked him. 







Knucks
 

In Abraham Lincoln's city, 

Where they remember his lawyer's shingle, 

The place where they brought him 

Wrapped in battle flags, 

Wrapped in the smoke of memories 

From Tallahassee to the Yukon, 

The place now where the shaft of his tomb 

Points white against the blue prairie dome, 

In Abraham Lincoln's city ... I saw knucks 

In the window of Mister Fischman's second-hand store 

On Second Street. 


I went in and asked, How much? 

Thirty cents apiece, answered Mister Fischman. 

And taking a box of new ones off a shelf 

He filled anew the box in the showcase 

And said incidentally, most casually 

And incidentally: 

I sell a carload a month of these. 


I slipped my fingers into a set of knucks, 

Cast-iron knucks molded in a foundry pattern, 

And there came to me a set of thoughts like these: 

Mister Fischman is for Abe and the malice to none stuff, 

And the street car strikers and the strike-breakers, 

And the sluggers, gunmen, detectives, policemen, 

Judges, utility heads, newspapers, priests, lawyers, 

They are all for Abe and the malice to none stuff. 


I started for the door. 

Maybe you want a lighter pair, 

Came Mister Fischman's voice. 

I opened the door ... and the voice again: 

You are a funny customer. 


Wrapped in battle flags, 

Wrapped in the smoke of memories, 

This is the place they brought him, 

This is Abraham Lincoln's home town.









from The People, Yes
 

Lincoln? 
He was a mystery in smoke and flags 
Saying yes to the smoke, yes to the flags, 
Yes to the paradoxes of democracy, 
Yes to the hopes of government 
Of the people by the people for the people, 
No to debauchery of the public mind, 
No to personal malice nursed and fed, 
Yes to the Constitution when a help, 
No to the Constitution when a hindrance 
Yes to man as a struggler amid illusions, 
Each man fated to answer for himself: 
Which of the faiths and illusions of mankind 
Must I choose for my own sustaining light 
To bring me beyond the present wilderness? 

       Lincoln? Was he a poet? 
       And did he write verses? 
"I have not willingly planted a thorn 
       in any man's bosom. 
I shall do nothing through malice: what 
       I deal with is too vast for malice. 

Death was in the air. 
So was birth.





Cool Tombs
 

When Abraham Lincoln was shoveled into the tombs, he forgot the copperheads and the assassin ... in the dust, in the cool tombs.


And Ulysses Grant lost all thought of con men and Wall Street, cash and collateral turned ashes ... in the dust, in the cool tombs.


Pocahontas' body, lovely as a poplar, sweet as a red haw in November or a pawpaw in May, did she wonder? does she remember? ... in the dust, in the cool tombs?


Take any streetful of people buying clothes and groceries, cheering a hero or throwing confetti and blowing tin horns ... tell me if the lovers are losers ... tell me if any get more than the lovers ... in the dust ... in the cool tombs.








Lincoln
 

Manic-depressive Lincoln, national hero!   
How just and true that this great nation, being conceived   
In liberty by fugitives should find   
--Strange ways and plays of monstrous History-- 
This Hamlet-type to be the President-- 

This failure, this unwilling bridegroom,   
This tricky lawyer full of black despair--   

He grew a beard, becoming President,   
And took a shawl as if he guessed his role,   
Though with the beard he fled cartoonists' blacks,   
And many laughed and were contemptuous,   
And some for four years spoke of killing him--   

He was a politician--of the heart!--   
He lived from hand to mouth in moral things!   
He understood quite well Grant's drunkenness!   
It was for him, before Election Day,   
That at Cold Harbor Grant threw lives away   
In hopeless frontal attack against Lee's breastworks!   

O how he was the Hamlet-man, and this,   
After a life of failure made him right,   
After he ran away on his wedding day,   
Writing a coward's letter to his bride--   
How with his very failure, he out-tricked   
The florid Douglas and the abstract Davis,   
And all the vain men who, surrounding him,   
Smiled in their vanity and sought his place--   

Later, they made him out a prairie Christ   
To sate the need coarse in the national heart--   

His wife went insane, Mary Todd too often   
Bought herself dresses. And his child died.   
And he would not condemn young men to death   
For having slept, in weakness. And he spoke   
More than he knew and all that he had felt   
Between outrageous joy and black despair   
Before and after Gettysburg's pure peak--   

He studied law, but knew in his own soul   
Despair's anarchy, terror and error,   
--Instruments had to be taken from his office   
And from his bedroom in such days of horror,   
Because some saw that he might kill himself:   
When he was young, when he was middle-aged,   
How just and true was he, our national hero!   

Sometimes he could not go home to face his wife,   
Sometimes he wished to hurry or end his life!   
But do not be deceived. He did not win,   
And, it is plain, the South could never win   
(Despite the gifted Northern generals!)   
--Capitalismus is not mocked, O no!   
This stupid deity decided the War--   

In fact, the North and South were losers both:   
--Capitalismus won the Civil War--   

--Capitalismus won the Civil War,   
Yet, in the War's cruel Colosseum,   
Some characters fulfilled their natures' surds,   
Grant the drunkard, Lee the noble soldier,   
John Brown in whom the Bible soared and cried,   
Booth the unsuccessful Shakespearean,   
--Each in some freedom walked and knew himself,   
Then most of all when all the deities   
Mixed with their barbarous stupidity   
To make the rock, root, and rot of the war--   

"This is the way each only life becomes,   
Tossed on History's ceaseless insane sums!





Return for an Instant
 

What was it like, God of mine, what was it like? 
--Oh unfaithful heart, indecisive intelligence! 
Was it like the going by of the wind? 
Like the disappearance of the spring? 

As nimble, as changeable, as weightless 
as milkweed seeds in summer . . . Yes! Indefinite 
as a smile which is lost forever in a laugh . . . 
Arrogant in the air, just like a flag! 

   Flag, smile, milkweed pod, swift 
spring in June, clear wind! . . . 
Your celebration was so wild, so sad! 

   All of your changes ended up in nothing-- 
remembrance, a blind bee of bitter things!-- 
I don't know what you were like, but you were! 






Night Piece
 

February 3rd
The sea with no waves we recognize, 
with no stations on its route, 
only water and moon, night after night! 

   My thought goes back to the land,   
someone else's land, belonging to the one 
going through it on trains at night,   
through the same place at the same hour 
as before . . . 

                        Remote mother, 
sleeping earth,   
powerful and faithful arms,   
the same quiet lap for all 
--tomb of eternal life 
with the same decorations freshened-- 
earth, mother, always 
true to yourself, waiting for 
the sad gaze 
of the wandering eyes! 

   My thought goes back to the land,   
--the olive groves at sunrise-- 
outlined sharply in the white   
or golden or yellow moonlight,   
that look forward to the coming back   
of those humans who are neither its slaves nor its masters, 
but who love it anyway . . .





Road
 

They all are asleep, below.   
                                        Above, awake,   
the helmsman and I. 

   He, watching the compass needle, lord 
of the bodies, with their keys turned 
in the locks. I, with my eyes 
toward the infinite, guiding 
the open treasures of the souls.





"I Am Not I
 

I am not I. 
                   I am this one 
walking beside me whom I do not see, 
whom at times I manage to visit, 
and whom at other times I forget; 
who remains calm and silent while I talk, 
and forgives, gently, when I hate, 
who walks where I am not, 
who will remain standing when I die.





"The Ship, Solid and Black
 

The ship, solid and black, 
enters the clear blackness 
of the great harbor. 
                              Quiet and cold. 
                                           --The people waiting 
are still asleep, dreaming, 
and warm, far away and still stretched out in this   
dream, perhaps . . . 

   How real our watch is, beside the dream 
of doubt the others had! How sure it is, compared 
to their troubled dream about us! 
                                                 Quiet. Silence. 
Silence which in breaking up at dawn 
will speak differently.





Dawn Outside the City Walls
 

You can see the face of everything, and it is white-- 
plaster, nightmare, adobe, anemia, cold-- 
turned to the east. Oh closeness to life! 
Hardness of life! Like something 
in the body that is animal--root, slag-ends-- 
with the soul still not set well there-- 
and mineral and vegetable! 
Sun standing stiffly against man, 
against the sow, the cabbages, the mud wall! 
--False joy, because you are merely 
in time, as they say, and not in the soul! 

   The entire sky taken up   
by moist and steaming heaps, 
a horizon of dung piles.   
Sour remains, here and there,   
of the night. Slices 
of the green moon, half-eaten, 
crystal bits from false stars, 
plaster, the paper ripped off, still faintly 
sky-blue. The birds 
not really awake yet, in the raw moon, 
streetlight nearly out.   
Mob of beings and things! 
--A true sadness, because you are really deep 
in the soul, as they say, not in time at all!





The Name Drawn from the Names
 

If I have created a world for you, in your place, 
god, you had to come to it confident, 
and you have come to it, to my refuge, 
because my whole world was nothing but my hope. 

   I have been saving up my hope 
in language, in a spoken name, a written name; 
I had given a name to everything, 
and you have taken the place 
of all these names. 

   Now I can hold back my movement 
inside the coal of my continual living and being, 
as the flame reins itself back inside the red coal, 
surrounded by air that is all blue fire; 
now I am my own sea that has been suddenly stopped somewhere, 
the sea I used to speak of, but not heavy, 
stiffened into waves of an awareness filled with light, 
and all of them moving upward, upward. 

   All the names that I gave 
to the universe that I created again for you 
are now all turning into one name, into one 
god. 

   The god who, in the end, is always 
the god created and recreated and recreated 
through grace and never through force. 
The God. The name drawn from the names.





Full Consciousness
 

You are carrying me, full consciousness, god that has desires, 
all through the world.   
                               Here, in this third sea, 
I almost hear your voice: your voice, the wind,   
filling entirely all movements; 
eternal colors and eternal lights, 
sea colors and sea lights. 

   Your voice full of white fire 
in the universe of water, the ship, the sky, 
marking out the roads with delight, 
engraving for me with a blazing light my firm orbit: 
a black body 
with the glowing diamond in its center.





Metals Metals
 

          
          Out of the golden West, out of the leaden East, into the iron South, and to the silver North . . . Oh metals metals everywhere, forks and knives, belt buckles and hooks . . . When you are beaten you sing. You do not give anyone a chance . . .        You come out of the earth and fly with men. You lodge in men. You hurt them terribly. You tear them. You do not care for anyone.        Oh metals metals, why are you always hanging about? Is it not enough that you hold men's wrists? Is it not enough that we let you in our mouths?        Why is it you will not do anything for yourself? Why is it you always wait for men to show you what to be?        And men love you. Perhaps it is because you soften so often.       You did, it is true, pour into anything men asked you to. It has always proved you to be somewhat softer than you really are.        Oh metals metals, why are you always filling my house?       You are like family, you do not care for anyone.
        




[The predictability of these rooms]
 

          
          The predictability of these rooms is, in a word, exquisite. These rooms in a word. The moon is predictably exquisite, as is the view of the moon through the word. Nevertheless, we were hoping for less. Less space, less light. We were hoping to pay more, to be made to pay in public. We desire a flat, affected tone. A beware of dog on keep off grass. The glass ceiling is exquisite. Is it made of glass? No, glass.
        




[The birds-eye view]
 

          
          The bird's-eye view abstracted from the bird. Cover me, says the soldier on the screen, I'm going in. We have the sense of being convinced, but of what? And by whom? The public is a hypothetical hole, a realm of pure disappearance, from which celestial matter explodes. I believe I can speak for everyone, begins the president, when I say famous last words.
        




Hesitation Theory
 

I drift into the sound of wind, 
how small my life must be 
to fit into his palm like that, holly 
leaf, bluejay feather, milkweed fluff, 
pin straw or sycamore pod, resembling 
scraps of light. The world 
slips through these fingers 
so easily, there's so much 
to miss: the sociable bones 
linked up in supple rows, mineral 
seams just under the skin. I hold 
my palm against the sun and don't see 
palm or sun, don't hold anything 
in either hand. I look up, look 
away (what's that?), I trip 
and stumble (fall 
again), find myself face down 
in duff, a foam of fallen live oak 
leaves, with only 
this life, mine at times.





Let Us Consider
 

          
          Let us consider the farmer who makes his straw hat his   sweetheart; or the old woman who makes a floor lamp her son; or the young woman who has set herself the task of scraping her shadow off a wall....      Let us consider the old woman who wore smoked cows' tongues for shoes and walked a meadow gathering cow chips in her apron; or a mirror grown dark with age that was given to a blind man who spent his nights looking into it, which saddened his mother, that her son should be so lost in vanity....      Let us consider the man who fried roses for his dinner, whose kitchen smelled like a burning rose garden; or the man who disguised himself as a moth and ate his overcoat, and for   dessert served himself a chilled fedora....
        




The Art Room
 

for my sisters
Because we did not have threads 
of turquoise, silver, and gold, 
we could not sew a sun nor sky. 
And our hands became balls of fire. 
And our arms spread open like wings. 

Because we had no chalk or pastels, 
no toad, forest, or morning-grass slats 
of paper, we had no colour 
for creatures. So we squatted 
and sprang, squatted and sprang. 

Four young girls, plaits heavy 
on our backs, our feet were beating 
drums, drawing rhythms from the floor; 
our mouths became woodwinds; 
our tongues touched teeth and were reeds.





Man in the Street or Hand Over Mouth
 

He claps a hand 
Across the gaping hole-- 

Or else the sight might 
Well inside to 

Melt the mind--if any 
Thinking spoke 

Were in the wheel, 
Or any real 

Fright-fragments broke 
Out of the gorge to 

Soak the breast, the meaning 
Might incite a stroke--best 

Press against it, close 
The clawhole, stand 

In stupor, petrified. The dream 
Be damned, the deeps defied. 

The hand's to keep 
The scream inside.





Spring
 

When daisies pied and violets blue 
   And lady-smocks all silver-white 
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue 
   Do paint the meadows with delight, 
The cuckoo then, on every tree, 
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 
                         Cuckoo; 
Cuckoo, cuckoo: Oh word of fear, 
Unpleasing to a married ear! 

When shepherds pipe on oaten straws, 
   And merry larks are plowmen's clocks, 
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws, 
   And maidens bleach their summer smocks, 
The cuckoo then, on every tree, 
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 
                         Cuckoo; 
Cuckoo, cuckoo: Oh word of fear, 
Unpleasing to a married ear!





Is My Team Ploughing
 

"Is my team ploughing, 
   That I was used to drive 
And hear the harness jingle 
   When I was man alive? 

Ay, the horses trample, 
   The harness jingles now; 
No change though you lie under 
   The land you used to plough. 

"Is football playing 
   Along the river shore, 
With lads to chase the leather, 
   Now I stand up no more? 

Ay the ball is flying, 
   The lads play heart and soul; 
The goal stands up, the keeper 
   Stands up to keep the goal. 

"Is my girl happy, 
   That I thought hard to leave, 
And has she tired of weeping 
   As she lies down at eve? 

Ay, she lies down lightly, 
   She lies not down to weep: 
Your girl is well contented. 
   Be still, my lad, and sleep. 

"Is my friend hearty, 
   Now I am thin and pine, 
And has he found to sleep in 
   A better bed than mine? 

Yes, lad, I lie easy, 
   I lie as lads would choose; 
I cheer a dead man's sweetheart, 
   Never ask me whose.





Break of Day
 

Tis true, tis day, what though it be? 
O wilt thou therefore rise from me? 
Why should we rise because tis light? 
Did we lie down because twas night? 
Love, which in spite of darkness brought us hither, 
Should in despite of light keep us together. 

Light hath no tongue, but is all eye; 
If it could speak as well as spy, 
This were the worst that it could say, 
That being well I fain would stay, 
And that I loved my heart and honour so, 
That I would not from him, that had them, go. 

Must business thee from hence remove? 
Oh, that's the worst disease of love, 
The poor, the foul, the false, love can 
Admit, but not the busied man. 
He which hath business, and makes love, doth do 
Such wrong, as when a married man doth woo. 







The Last Laugh
 

O Jesus Christ! I'm hit,' he said; and died. 
Whether he vainly cursed or prayed indeed, 
                 The Bullets chirped--In vain, vain, vain! 
                 Machine-guns chuckled--Tut-tut! Tut-tut! 
                 And the Big Gun guffawed. 

Another sighed,--O Mother,--mother,--Dad!' 
 Then smiled at nothing, childlike, being dead. 
                 And the lofty Shrapnel-cloud 
                 Leisurely gestured,--Fool!            
                 And the splinters spat, and tittered.

My Love!' one moaned. Love-languid seemed his mood, 
Till slowly lowered, his whole face kissed the mud. 
                 And the Bayonets' long teeth grinned; 
                 Rabbles of Shells hooted and groaned; 
                 And the Gas hissed.





Come Up from the Fields Father
 

Come up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete, 
And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy dear son. 

Lo, 'tis autumn, 
Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder, 
Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind, 
Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd vines,   
(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines? 
Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?) 

Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with wondrous clouds,   
Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well. 

Down in the fields all prospers well, 
But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's call, 
And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away. 

Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling, 
She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap. 

Open the envelope quickly,   
O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd, 
O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's soul! 
All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main words only, 
Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken to hospital, 
At present low, but will soon be better. 

Ah now the single figure to me, 
Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms, 
Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint, 
By the jamb of a door leans. 

Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through her sobs, 
The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd,) 
See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better. 
Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be better, that brave and simple soul,) 
While they stand at home at the door he is dead already, 
The only son is dead. 

But the mother needs to be better, 
She with thin form presently drest in black, 
By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking, 
In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,   
O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and withdraw, 
To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.





Song of Myself: 35
 

Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight? 
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars? 
List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it to me. 

Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,) 
His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be; 
Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us. 

We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd, 
My captain lash'd fast with his own hands. 

We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water, 
On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead. 

Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark, 
Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported, 
The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves. 

The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels, 
They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust. 

Our frigate takes fire, 
The other asks if we demand quarter? 
If our colors are struck and the fighting done? 

Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain, 
We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the fighting. 

Only three guns are in use, 
One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's mainmast, 
Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks. 

The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top, 
They hold out bravely during the whole of the action. 

Not a moment's cease, 
The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine. 

One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking. 

Serene stands the little captain, 
He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low, 
His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns. 

Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.





Song of Myself: 36
 

Stretch'd and still lies the midnight, 

Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,

Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer'd,

The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet,

Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,

The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl'd whiskers,

The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,

The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty, 

Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,

Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,

Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,

A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining, 

Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,

The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,

Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan,

These so, these irretrievable.





Lines Depicting Simple Happiness
 

The shine on her buckle took precedence in sun 
Her shine, I should say, could take me anywhere 
It feels right to be up this close in tight wind 
It feels right to notice all the shiny things about you 
About you there is nothing I wouldn't want to know 
With you nothing is simple yet nothing is simpler 
About you many good things come into relation 
I think of proofs and grammar, vowel sounds, like 
A is for knee socks, E for panties 
I is for buttondown, O the blouse you wear 
U is for hair clip, and Y your tight skirt 
The music picks up again, I am the man I hope to be 
The bright air hangs freely near your newly cut hair 
It is so easy now to see gravity at work in your face 
Easy to understand time, that dark process 
To accept it as a beautiful process, your face





A Panic That Can Still Come Upon Me
 

If today and today I am calling aloud 

If I break into pieces of glitter on asphalt 
bits of sun, the din 

if tires whine on wet pavement 
everything humming 

If we find we are still in motion 
and have arrived in Zeno's thought, like 

if sunshine hits marble and the sea lights up 
we might know we were loved, are loved 
if flames and harvest, the enchanted plain 

If our wishes are met with dirt 
and thyme, thistle, oil, 
heirloom, and basil 

or the end result is worry, chaos 
and if "I should know better 

If our loves are anointed with missiles 
Apache fire, Tomahawks 
did we follow the tablets the pilgrims suggested 

If we ask that every song touch its origin 
just once and the years engulfed 

If problems of identity confound sages, 
derelict philosophers, administrators 
who can say I am found 

if this time you, all of it, this time now 

If nothing save Saturdays at the metro and 
if rain falls sidelong in the platz 
doorways, onto mansard roofs 

If enumerations of the fall 
and if falling, cities rocked 
with gas fires at dawn 

Can you rescind the ghost's double nakedness 
hungry and waning 

if children, soldiers, children   
taken down in schools 

if burning fuel 

Who can't say they have seen this 
and can we sing this 

if in the auroras' reflecting the sea, 
gauze touching the breast 

Too bad for you, beautiful singer 
unadorned by laurel 
child of thunder and scapegoat alike 

If the crowd in the mind becoming 
crowded in street and villages, and trains 
run next to the freeway 

If exit is merely a sign





Vincent, Homesick for the Land of Pictures
 

Is this what you intended, Vincent 
that we take our rest at the end of the grove 
nestled into our portion beneath the bird's migration 
saying, who and how am I made better through struggle. 
Or why am I I inside this empty arboretum 
this inward spiral of whoop ass and vision 
the leafy vine twisting and choking the tree. 
O, dear heaven, if you are indeed that 
or if you can indeed hear what I might say 
heal me and grant me laughter's bounty 
of eyes and smiles, of eyes and affection. 

To not be naive and think of silly answers only 
not to imagine answers would be the only destination 
nor is questioning color even useful now 
now that the white ray in the distant tree beacons. 
That the sun can do this to us, every one of us 
that the sun can do this to everything inside 
the broken light refracted through leaves. 
What the ancients called peace, no clearer example 
what our fathers called the good, what better celebration. 
Leaves shine in the body and in the head alike 
the sun touches deeper than thought. 

O to be useful, of use, to the actual seen thing 
to be in some way related by one's actions in the world. 
There might be nothing greater than this 
nothing truer to the good feelings that vibrate within 
like in the middle of the flower I call your name. 
To correspond, to be in equanimity with organic stuff 
to toil and to reflect and to home and to paint 
father, and further, the migration of things. 
The homing action of geese and wood mice. 
The ample evidence of the sun inside all life 
inside all life seen and felt and all the atomic pieces too. 

But felt things exist in shadow, let us reflect. 
The darkness bears a shine as yet unpunished by clarity 
but perhaps a depth that outshines clarity and is true. 
The dark is close to doubt and therefore close to the sun 
at least what the old books called science or bowed down to. 
The dark is not evil for it has indigo and cobalt inside 
and let us never forget indigo and the warmth of that 
the warmth of the mind reflected in a dark time 
in the time of pictures and refracted light. 
Ah, the sun is here too in the polar region of night 
the animal proximity of another and of nigh. 

To step into it as into a large surf in late August 
to go out underneath it all above and sparkling. 
To wonder and to dream and to look up at it 
wondrous and strange companion to all our days 
and the toil and worry and animal fear always with us. 
The night sky, the deep sense of space, actual bodies of light 
the gemstone brushstrokes in rays and shimmers 
to be held tight, wound tighter in the act of seeing. 
The sheer vertical act of feeling caught up in it 
the sky, the moon, the many heavenly forms 
these starry nights alone and connected alive at the edge. 

Now to think of the silver and the almost blue in pewter. 
To feel these hues down deep, feel color wax and wane 
and yellow, yellows are the tonality of work and bread. 
The deep abiding sun touching down and making its impression 
making so much more of itself here than where it signals 
the great burning orb installed at the center of each and every thing. 
Isn't it comforting this notion of each and every thing 
though nothing might be the final and actual expression of it 
that nothing at the center of something alive and burning 
green then mint, blue then shale, gray and gray into violet 
into luminous dusk into dust then scattered now gone. 

But what is the use now of this narrow ray, this door ajar 
the narrow path canopied in dense wood calling 
what of the striated purposelessness in lapidary shading and line. 
To move on, to push forward, to take the next step, to die. 
The circles grow large and ripple in the hatch-marked forever 
the circle on the horizon rolling over and over into paint 
into the not near, the now far, the distant long-off line of daylight. 
That light was my enemy and one great source of agony 
one great solace in paint and brotherhood the sky and grass. 
The fragrant hills spoke in flowering tones I could hear 
the gnarled cut stumps tearing the sky, eating the sun.

now that the white ray in the distant tree beacons. 
Nor is questioning color even useful now 
nor to imagine answers would be the only destination 
to not be naive and think of silly answers only. 

Of eyes and smiles, of eyes and affection 
heal me and grant me laughter's bounty. 
Or if you can indeed hear what I might say 
O, dear heaven, if you are indeed that 
the leafy vine twisting and choking the tree 
this inward spiral of whoop ass and vision. 
Or why am I I inside this empty arboretum 
saying, who and how am I made better through struggle 
nestled into our portion beneath the bird's migration 
that we take our rest at the end of the grove 
is this what you intended, Vincent.





Our Valley
 

We don't see the ocean, not ever, but in July and August 
when the worst heat seems to rise from the hard clay   
of this valley, you could be walking through a fig orchard 
when suddenly the wind cools and for a moment   
you get a whiff of salt, and in that moment you can almost 
believe something is waiting beyond the Pacheco Pass, 
something massive, irrational, and so powerful even 
the mountains that rise east of here have no word for it. 

You probably think I'm nuts saying the mountains   
have no word for ocean, but if you live here   
you begin to believe they know everything.   
They maintain that huge silence we think of as divine, 
a silence that grows in autumn when snow falls 
slowly between the pines and the wind dies 
to less than a whisper and you can barely catch 
your breath because you're thrilled and terrified. 

You have to remember this isn't your land.   
It belongs to no one, like the sea you once lived beside 
and thought was yours. Remember the small boats   
that bobbed out as the waves rode in, and the men   
who carved a living from it only to find themselves   
carved down to nothing. Now you say this is home,   
so go ahead, worship the mountains as they dissolve in dust,   
wait on the wind, catch a scent of salt, call it our life.





On Wanting to Tell [       ] about a Girl Eating Fish Eyes
 

--how her loose curls float 
above each silver fish as she leans in 
to pluck its eyes-- 

You died just hours ago. 
Not suddenly, no. You'd been dying so long   
nothing looked like itself: from your window,   
fishermen swirled sequins;   
fishnets entangled the moon. 

Now the dark rain   
looks like dark rain. Only the wine   
shimmers with candlelight. I refill the glasses 
and we raise a toast to you   
as so and so's daughter--elfin, jittery as a sparrow-- 
slides into another lap   
to eat another pair of slippery eyes   
with her soft fingers, fingers rosier each time,   
for being chewed a little. 

If only I could go to you, revive you. 
You must be a little alive still.   
I'd like to put this girl in your lap. 
She's almost feverishly warm and she weighs   
hardly anything. I want to show you how   
she relishes each eye, to show you 
her greed for them.   

She is placing one on her tongue, 
bright as a polished coin--   

What do they taste like? I ask. 
Twisting in my lap, she leans back 
sleepily. They taste like eyes, she says.





Hail
 

Mary who mattered to me, gone or asleep 
among fruits, spilled   

in ash, in dust, I did not   

leave you. Even now I can't keep from 
composing you, limbs & blue cloak   

& soft hands. I sleep to the sound   

of your name, I say there is no Mary   
except the word Mary, no trace   

on the dust of my pillowslip. I only   

dream of your ankles brushed by dark violets, 
of honeybees above you   

murmuring into a crown. Antique queen,   

the night dreams on: here are the pears 
I have washed for you, here the heavy-winged doves,   

asleep by the hyacinths. Here I am,   

having bathed carefully in the syllables   
of your name, in the air and the sea of them, the sharp scent   

of their sea foam. What is the matter with me? 

Mary, what word, what dust   
can I look behind? I carried you a long way   

into my mirror, believing you would carry me 

back out. Mary, I am still   
for you, I am still a numbness for you.





Zeus to Juno
 

He-- 

You saw the way her body looked at me   
         all address 
                     calling me down   
she was so 
         well-turned, 
                     curve and volume 
her body presented itself-- 
         Clay-- 
                     I could mold it 


She-- 

You were taboo   
not totem-- 
covered her   
though your wing gave no shelter 

Your pale plumage   
became shadow   
Your beak caught   
in the net of her hair 


He-- 

When I entered her 
         her death became my life   
in her death swoon 
         she fell away from me   
the more she fell 
         the deeper I pursued her   
the deeper I went 
         the more lost she became   
her body 
         became a forest of echoes   
hills and valleys 
         echoing each other, a language 
I didn't know-- 
         surrounded: alone 


She-- 

The discarded body   
lies in long grass   
Flies and wasps   
fumble there-- 

on a summer day   
the lost girl hums-- 
Kelly, Sarah, Joanne changed   
into parable 

Prodigal hair   
flung out   
             body agape   
like a question 

The scavenger crow knows-- 
she's beautiful, 
outgrowing her name   
in the noon heat





Her
 

There is no noisier place than the suburbs, 
someone once said to me 
as we were walking along a fairway, 
and every day is delighted to offer fresh evidence: 

the chainsaw, the leaf-blower blowing 
one leaf around an enormous house with columns, 
on Mondays and Thursdays the garbage truck 
equipped with air brakes, reverse beeper, and merciless grinder. 

There's dogs, hammers, backhoes 
or serious earthmovers if today is not your day. 
How can the birds get a peep 
or a chirp in edgewise, I would like to know? 

But this morning is different, 
only a soft clicking sound 
and the low talk of two workmen working 
on the house next door, laying tile I am guessing. 

Otherwise, all quiet for a change, 
just the clicking of tiles being handled 
and their talking back and forth in Spanish 
then one of them asking in English 

"What was her name? and the silence of the other.





The Chairs That No One Sits In
 

You see them on porches and on lawns 
down by the lakeside, 
usually arranged in pairs implying a couple 

who might sit there and look out 
at the water or the big shade trees. 
The trouble is you never see anyone 

sitting in these forlorn chairs 
though at one time it must have seemed   
a good place to stop and do nothing for a while. 

Sometimes there is a little table 
between the chairs where no one   
is resting a glass or placing a book facedown. 

It might be none of my business, 
but it might be a good idea one day 
for everyone who placed those vacant chairs 

on a veranda or a dock to sit down in them 
for the sake of remembering 
whatever it was they thought deserved 

to be viewed from two chairs   
side by side with a table in between. 
The clouds are high and massive that day. 

The woman looks up from her book. 
The man takes a sip of his drink. 
Then there is nothing but the sound of their looking, 

the lapping of lake water, and a call of one bird 
then another, cries of joy or warning-- 
it passes the time to wonder which.

Antiquity Calling
 

Looking at Mapplethorpe's Polaroids, I learn that he 
liked shoes and armpit crotch-shots of men and women, 
both shaved and un'--all giving a good whiff to the camera. 
But best of all are his pictures of ordinary phones 
which convey a palpable sense of expectancy as if 
at any moment, one of the fabulous, laconic nude men 
strewn about might call. One could pick up the receiver 
and hear the garbled sound of ancient Greek and Roman 
voices reveling in the background. But even when silent, 
the dingy phone is a sex organ--cock asleep in its cradle.





Plaint in a Major Key
 

Without even leaving one's door, One can know the whole world.--Laozi
The rumble of the night sounds 
even in the bright daylight 
of morning. Life blooms amid 
the Ten Thousand Things, but 
does not bloom amid the Ten 
Thousand Things. Shrivel-eyed 
I wake up and tend to the One 
here and now, clamoring to be 
let out. Down with the gate, 
out with the boy, to the rooms 
of life's necessities, first 
to void and next to fill. 
The Order is only order which 
is disorder, the only Disorder 
is the disorder that is order. 
We usher ourselves, each in our 
own way, back down the way 
for various brushings, combings, 
other groomings. Each in our 
own way we urge the other 
toward some kind of growth: 
one to assume, the other   
to renounce; one to grow larger, 
the other to grow smaller, 
thereby growing larger. Words 
do not work, and when they do not, 
other words might. This makes 
more sense than it seems, works 
more often than it doesn't, 
except when it really doesn't, 
and then that disorder creeps 
back in. In five minutes, 
a different challenge. In five 
hours, a different One. Six 
more hours, the One is rubbing 
eyes, untangled like a dragon, 
shucked and undone like an oyster. 
The night slowly rolls abed 
and the words form stories form 
sleep, the sleep of the Ten 
Thousand Things, the sleep 
that will echo the next day 
in the night's rumbling sounds, 
in the bright light of morning.





Murray Dreaming
 

It's not the sharks 
Sliding mere inches from his upturned face 
Through warps of water where the tunnel arcs 
Transparent overhead, 
Their lipless jaws clamped shut, extruding teeth, 
Their eyes that stare at nothing, like the dead, 
Staring at him; it's not the eerie grace 
Of rays he stood beneath, 
Gaping at their entranced slow-motion chase 

That is unending; 
It's not the ultra-auditory hum 
Of ET cuttlefish superintending 
The iridescent craft   
Of their lit selves, as messages were sent, 
Turning the sight of him they photographed 
To code: it is not this that left him dumb 
With schoolboy wonderment 
Those hours he wandered the aquarium. 

It is that room, 
That room of Murray River they had walled 
In glass and, deep within the shifting gloom 
And subtle drifts of sky 
That filtered down, it seemed, from the real day 
Of trees and bird light many fathoms high, 
The giant Murray cod that was installed 
In stillness to delay 
All that would pass. The boy stood there enthralled. 

Out in the day 
Again, he saw the famous streets expound 
Their theories about speed, the cars obey, 
Racing to catch the sun, 
The loud fast-forward crowds, and thought it odd 
That in the multitudes not everyone 
Should understand as he did the profound 
Profession of the cod, 
That held time, motionless, unknown to sound. 

In bed at night, 
Are his eyes open or is this a dream? 
The room is all dark water, ghosted light, 
And midway to the ceiling 
The great fish with its working fins and gills 
Suspended, while before it glide the reeling 
And see-through scenes of day, faintly agleam, 
Until their passage stills 
And merges with the deep unmoving stream.





To a Wedding
 

The city humid, the church rusty and Baroque, and the directions appalling, 
the Miami sky turned gray as a blanket, and soon tropical rain was falling; 
the priest repeatedly invoked the Beast in View, as if he were stalling; 
and in the back a few ushers whipped out their cell phones and started calling. 
What of the palm scrub, through which mildewed creatures came crawling, 
or the two cousins from Chicago, who at the reception couldn't stop brawling? 
All weddings are madness, and except for the sherbet-hued bridesmaids not even a little enthralling. 
But the stooped and aged, what in their moth-eaten hours were they recalling? 
Some first nervous kiss, perhaps, the razor of a touch, and all that "Baby Doll"-ing; 
then the mortgage in Opa-Locka, nine months of waiting, and half a life of squalling.





mi'kmaq book of the dead
 

  mIEKAL aND often incorporates alien scripts into his work. These can be undecipherable writing systems of history, scripts unfamiliar to most people, and scripts invented by him or others. He uses these to allow us to see written language with new eyes, to appreciate its visual forms, and to face the process of searching for meaning in a foreign textscape. His "mi'kmaq book of the dead" combines seemingly recognizable characters with apparently pictographic ones, encouraging us to pick out a meaning we will never quite find on our own.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





Vortextique
 

  The world of visual poetry is known for its collaborations, and some visual poets create a large percentage of their works in this way. What is interesting about K.S. Ernst and Sheila E. Murphy's collaborations is how seamless they are, as if created from one intelligence, even though the poets come from different areas of major practice. Ernst is highly attuned to the world of the visual arts, producing works designed for gallery spaces. Murphy is an active textual poet and a more recent participant in visual poetry. In "Vortextique," the vortex before us is literal: a maelstrom of words that suggests the ultimate artificiality of linguistic signs, the ambiguity of speech, and the impossibility of absolutely accurate communication.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





untitled (for Natalee and Jeremy)
 

  derek beaulieu often works at the edges of language, using isolated letters to create visual, instead of verbal, patterns and deconstructing found texts to tease out hidden meanings. His "untitled (for Natalee and Jeremy)," produced for two of his friends, is either a visual poetry epithalamium or simply a joyous celebration of the physical beauties of lettershape and writing. The resulting poem, which is created with press-on type, gains most of its effects from the repetition of identical letters, visual poetry's equivalent to rhyme, consonance, and assonance.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





The Disremembered Glossolalist
 

  Peter Ciccariello provides an interesting dilemma to readers of his work. His process usually begins with the writing of a standard lineated poem, but he takes the text of that poem and wraps it around the landforms and ruins of an invented realm that he creates through meticulous computer modeling. The results are stunning and enigmatic textscapes that a reader must sift through carefully to imagine what they originally were and what they originally communicated.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





alwaysendeavor
 

  Bob Dahlquist is an artist whose work I first noticed in New York City's Bryant Park, where I saw staring down at me an imaginative logo for a sandwich shop. The logo demonstrated Dahlquist's grasp of what I call the printer's fist--an understanding of the visual and intellectual significance of typographic characters. His "alwaysendeavor" replicates the look of old-fashioned office signs etched into translucent glass doors, but in this case we see the text from both sides at once, and we must pull apart the strands of overlapping text to reconstitute the meaning.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





Mama
 

  Jesse Patrick Ferguson is a Canadian visual poet working in both visual and textual forms. His "Mama" shows how little text it takes to make a successful visual poem. Consisting of nothing but the letter "e," variously presented, this poem represents the simple warbling cry of a child. The poem is both a touching visualization of an aural event and a strong example of how xerographic transmogrification can add character and meaning to text.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





haiku #62
 

  Scott Helmes is a longtime visual poet who has produced works in a variety of forms, including mathematical poetry and rubber-stamped poetry. His "haiku #62" is part of a series of striking poems created from scraps of colored text torn out of glossy magazines and arrayed in three tiers. These tiers approximate the look of haiku, and the text flutters in and out of different colors and typefaces, giving the poems their ineffable beauty.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





from "Origins of Poetry
 

  Joel Lipman has worked for years with rubber stamps, creating poems on yellowing acidic pages torn out of old books. This technique produces a frisson between the apparently unrelated base text and Lipman's overtext. As evidenced by the meter and movement of the words on the page above, it is clear that Lipman is writing real poetry, but it is poetry enhanced by the distinctive appearance of the words.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





toon tune
 

  gustave morin's primary form is the collage poem. His "toon tune" is a remarkable piece of craftsmanship. Its sixty-three individual fragments of text are cut into the shapes of jigsaw puzzle pieces and are fit perfectly together in a rectangular grid. The "words" of the poem consist almost entirely of the extravagant visualizations of onomatopoeia from comic books, producing a visual symphony of crashes and cries.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





fallen
 

  jrg piringer works in many forms, including visual, digital, and sound poetry, as well as music. In "fallen," piringer combines a visual sensibility with computer programming skills to tumble text from the English translation of The Communist Manifesto into a pile at the bottom of the page. The result is a mass of letters stripped of their original meaning and representing the failure of an idea.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





untitled
 

  Philip Gallo is a typographer-poet, or "typoet," and his work depends on the careful alignment of simple words for its effects. "untitled" makes reference to the concrete poetry of the middle of the twentieth century. Diter Rot, whose name serves as the central text of this poem, was famous for a number of rigid typographical poems, including one that played with the letters "t" and "u" to produce, in varying ways, the words "tu" (you) and "ut" ("do" on the musical scale). Gallo's poem also appears to allude to "ping pong" by Eugen Gomringer, another early concrete poet.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





Labile
 

  Michael Basinski creates visual poems that are colorful cacophonies of text and shape. His handwritten poems, which often serve as scores for equally exuberant sound poems, are filled to the margin with broken lines of text that curl into one another, read from different directions, and are often filled with nonsense words of his own invention. "Labile" is a good example of a visual poem that defiantly spurns convention. It is a neo-Dadaist poem intent on shaking the reader out of quiet acceptance and somnolence.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry >>





The Elephant
 

How to explain my heroic courtesy? I feel 
          that my body was inflated by a mischievous boy. 

Once I was the size of a falcon, the size of a lion, 
          once I was not the elephant I find I am. 

My pelt sags, and my master scolds me for a botched 
          trick. I practiced it all night in my tent, so I was 

somewhat sleepy. People connect me with sadness 
          and, often, rationality. Randall Jarrell compared me 

to Wallace Stevens, the American poet. I can see it 
          in the lumbering tercets, but in my mind 

I am more like Eliot, a man of Europe, a man 
          of cultivation. Anyone so ceremonious suffers   

breakdowns. I do not like the spectacular experiments 
          with balance, the high-wire act and cones. 

We elephants are images of humility, as when we 
          undertake our melancholy migrations to die. 

Did you know, though, that elephants were taught 
          to write the Greek alphabet with their hooves? 

Worn out by suffering, we lie on our great backs, 
          tossing grass up to heaven--as a distraction, not a prayer. 

That's not humility you see on our long final journeys: 
          it's procrastination. It hurts my heavy body to lie down.

A Diamond
 

A Translation for Robert Jones
A diamond 
Is there 
At the heart of the moon or the branches or my nakedness 
And there is nothing in the universe like diamond 
Nothing in the whole mind. 

The poem is a seagull resting on a pier at the end of the ocean. 

A dog howls at the moon 
A dog howls at the branches 
A dog howls at the nakedness 
A dog howling with pure mind. 

I ask for the poem to be as pure as a seagull's belly. 

The universe falls apart and discloses a diamond 
Two words called seagull are peacefully floating out where the 
       waves are. 
The dog is dead there with the moon, with the branches, with 
       my nakedness 
And there is nothing in the universe like diamond 
Nothing in the whole mind.





phabetical
 

  Nico Vassilakis uses various processes to bring us to his visual poems. In "phabetical he uses a toy microscope with a built-in video camera to capture highly magnified images of text, often with his hand moving the microscope across the page to capture still text in motion. As he has done here, Vassilakis sometimes modifies the settings on the camera so that the texts are captured in unnatural colors, and he sometimes reverses the polarity of these to further alter their materiality. In this poem, he has used a software process to band many slips of texts into columns and rows, and he has captured these blocks of text in motion so that we can see all of the middle column but only half of the two columns to either side of it. The result uses Greek letters (an homage to his ancestry) so abstracted that they appear before us almost as concrete images: birds, an arm reaching out, a child kicking a ball. He forces us to see not the common symbols of our alphabet but instead the "phabet: the pictographs from which all alphabets arose.--Geof Huth  More About Visual Poetry > >

What should she do   to safeguard   her belongings? 
she begs for help   urges us to lock 
to triple lock   the doors   to hide her things 
her pearls right   here   her fruitwood in New York 
her mother's hand-carved walnut chairs   the leather- 
surfaced desk   at which my father sat 
so long ago   wearing the cashmere sweater 
grandma bought him   and the Sulka shirt 
Listen!   Are we listening!   Have we heard? 
How well he dressed!   How beautiful their place! 
four rooms in Queens   what lots couldn't afford 
in an age of breadlines   shameful jobs   or worse 
"Tuono di Dio!   thunder of God   she looses 
the curse she learned in childhood   for most uses 


5 

The curses learned   in childhood   have their uses 
Tuono di Dio!   she swears when they strip her   bare 
to bathe her   Tuono di Dio!   when the nurses 
slide the soiled bed pads   to the floor 
or prop her   in the wheelchair   to be fed 
thunder of God   echoes along the halls 
when she tries to fight   the husky nurse's aide 
come to sponge her bruises   stains and spills 
embarrassed   we shiver   in the corridor 
while she flails   and shrieks for the police 
"Tuono di Dio!   Call the police!   God's thunder 
will scorch us if we leave her   in this place 
away from her apartment   calm   and peace 
away from her belongings   purse and keys 


6 

Away from her belongings   purse   and keys 
(and crumpled Kleenex   reading glasses coins 
and comb she always   carries   in that purse) 
she isn't real!   she might be only bones! 
yet the belongings   longings   must go on 
the bookcase and the rugs   and tables must 
survive   outlast her   so she tells her grandson 
how to plan an auction   in the east 
there are the costs   of those belongings   that 
the value of mahogany   and this 
the price of sterling silver (which she fought 
to buy--a fifth-grade teacher   in the thirties--) 
and the bracelets   furs   her in-laws gave 
too bad they can't   go with her to the grave! 


7 

What happens to belongings   after the grave? 
They'll be   up here and she   she'll be   down there 
what of the   stuff she worked   so hard   to have? 
polished mahogany   and mink   and silver 
and even the fifteen-year-old   television 
still good   still just right for the nightly news 
and the brand-new   vacuum cleaner   even 
still a-- a something   someone ought   to choose 
her face is crumpling   like a handkerchief 
don't give it all   away   don't give it up 
if you don't want it   at least sell it off! 
don't let the others   have it either   stop 
the thieves before   they drag it all    away 
don't let my belongings   go astray. . . . 


8 

Don't let my   belongings   go astray 
call the super   tell the doorman   keep 
the windows locked   and barred   the crooks away 
the one who break   and enter   when you sleep 
the ones   who follow   sullen   knife and rape 
how many years   she's warned us   can't we hear 
they'll pick the locks   they'll climb the fire   escape 
just look   the crooks are here   are everywhere 
a sudden nod   a glance at   the next bed 
where a wizened   person   gasps and snores 
that one now   she saw her   yes she did 
peering in closets   rummaging in drawers 
even in hospitals   they have   no pity 
they rob you   when they see   your things are   pretty 


9 

Yet O it's nice   that all her things are   pretty 
her smile blazes   back in Jackson Heights 
(on one of the   better   blocks   in New York City) 
her beautiful   apartment   basks and waits 
a hush of rugs   a drawn Venetian   blind 
keeping the silence   keeping the bars   of shadow 
gathered like silent   guardians   around 
the hanging   shelf   the Wedgewood   the piano 
and there the family   photographs   are massed 
my father's face   blade-thin   in sepia 
my baby self   in flounces   or undressed 
from times   when she was poor   but happier 
belongings blurry   as if   underwater 
bearing the prints   of mother   father   daughter 


10 

How far the age   of mother   father   daughter! 
my baby room with walls   now pink   now blue 
(but never yellow   though I begged   I fought her) 
and the tiny snowman   globe   where snowflakes   flew 
and the little silver   Virgin Mary   shrine 
whose key I   turned   to play Our Lady's song 
"Ave Maria   tinkling   out of tune 
and the gray   hooked rug   where silent bluebirds sang 
and a rabbit ran   away   among the trees 
but never   vanished   never could   escape 
whatever chased him   from the knitted haze 
a scary   thing   because   it had no shape 
though now the whole   room's painted hazy   gray 
and the rabbit   trees   and birds   raveled away 


11 

When did her mind   begin to ravel   away? 
--that time she fell   outside   the beauty parlor 
(getting pretty for   her grandson's    birthday)? 
she didn 't   answer   when we tried   to call her 
and soon   with mop and broom   she fought the others 
called 911   the super   the police 
there on the sofa   sat   the nursing mothers 
the lovers   crawled and thrashed   under the bookcase 
we flew   to Queens   we packed up all   her things 
the fox-head furs   her mother 's lion-necklace 
"But what about all my other   best   belongings? 
she worried   then gave up   resigned   to silence 
a roar of takeoff   buckled in   she hissed 
"Here's to my new   adventure   in the west! 


12 

At sundown   tantrums   shake the sunset west 
the nurses turn her toward the flashing   window 
"See the flowers? See the pretty bird's nest? 
bushes tug in tubs   on the patio 
where a night   wind   rises   over Astroturf 
batters the waiting   tables   chairs   and wheelchairs 
as if they stood   in a swirl   of Pacific surf 
whose icy water   glitters   darkens   clears 
"Here's dinner, hon! the nurse's aide   with bib 
holds out a tray of lukewarm   grown-up   mush 
last week a fall   tore muscles   cracked a rib 
how did   she fall   did someone   really push? 
she tries to remember   strains to see   remembers 
(sometimes) the names   of sundown   visitors 


13 

Sometimes the names   of sundown visitors 
hook into thought   sometimes the sounds   unravel 
blur   sister   brothers   TV commentators 
(Frank and Vito turn into Ted Koppel) 
I visit   afternoons   bring cupcakes   chocolate 
the only stuff she   ever wants   to eat 
can barely swallow though   one night past midnight 
she coughs   a little   chokes on   her own spit 
the night nurse   didn't hear   the radio 
was turned on loud   she's kind of scared   and sorry 
and puts a rose   on the poor   old lady's   pillow 
and a mortician   calls   and tells us   not to worry 
above the sunlit bay   the slicing planes 
rise fast   and one speeds east   with her "remains 


14 

Back among   her belongings   her remains 
glide north northwest   in a shiny   SUV 
designed to weather snowstorms   freezing rains 
far from the simmering   fields   of Sicily 
the East Coast cemetery's stony   pressed 
into a cleft   of hills   black ice   I skid on 
leaning to greet the freckled   hearty   priest 
looking   not looking at the box   she's laid in 
at the edge of the polished   boards   that hold her husband 
the priest   says the words   she scorned   she didn't believe 
(she has to be blessed   to belong   to holy ground) 
and O she would   scold us   if she were still alive! 
no Tuono di dio   no bolt   so fierce and true 
as the light of her mind   that felt   that thought   that knew 






Poem Beginning with a Line by Frank Lima
 

And how terrific it is to write a radio poem 
and how terrific it is to stand on the roof and 
watch the stars go by and how terrific it is to be 
misled inside a hallway, and how terrific it is 
to be the hallway as it stands inside the house, 
and how terrific it is, shaped like a telephone, 
to be filled with scotch and stand out on the street, 
and how terrific it is to see the stars inside the radios 
and cows, and how terrific the cows are, crossing 
at night, in their unjaundiced way and moving 
through the moonlight, and how terrific the night is, 
purveyor of the bells and distant planets, and how 
terrific it is to write this poem as I sleep, to sleep 
in distant planets in my mind and cross at night the 
cows in hallways riding stars to radios at night, and 
how terrific night you are, across the bridges, into 
tunnels, into bars, and how terrific it is that you are 
this too, the fields of planetary pull, terrific, living 
on the Hudson, inside the months of spring, an 
underwater crossing for the cows in dreams, terrific, 
like the radios, the songs, the poem and the stars.





Riot
 

A riot is the language of the unheard.  --martin luther king
John Cabot, out of Wilma, once a Wycliffe, 
all whitebluerose below his golden hair, 
wrapped richly in right linen and right wool, 
almost forgot his Jaguar and Lake Bluff; 
almost forgot Grandtully (which is The 
Best Thing That Ever Happened To Scotch); almost 
forgot the sculpture at the Richard Gray 
and Distelheim; the kidney pie at Maxim's, 
the Grenadine de Boeuf at Maison Henri. 

Because the Negroes were coming down the street. 

Because the Poor were sweaty and unpretty 
(not like Two Dainty Negroes in Winnetka) 
and they were coming toward him in rough ranks. 
In seas. In windsweep. They were black and loud. 
And not detainable. And not discreet. 

Gross. Gross. "Que tu es grossier! John Cabot 
itched instantly beneath the nourished white 
that told his story of glory to the World. 
"Don't let It touch me! the blackness! Lord! he whispered 
to any handy angel in the sky. 
But, in a thrilling announcement, on It drove 
and breathed on him: and touched him. In that breath 
the fume of pig foot, chitterling and cheap chili, 
malign, mocked John. And, in terrific touch, old 
averted doubt jerked forward decently, 
cried, "Cabot! John! You are a desperate man, 
and the desperate die expensively today. 

John Cabot went down in the smoke and fire 
and broken glass and blood, and he cried "Lord! 
Forgive these nigguhs that know not what they do.

Primer For Blacks
 

Blackness 
is a title, 
is a preoccupation, 
is a commitment Blacks 
are to comprehend-- 
and in which you are 
to perceive your Glory. 

The conscious shout 
of all that is white is 
"It's Great to be white. 
The conscious shout 
of the slack in Black is 
"It's Great to be white." 
Thus all that is white 
has white strength and yours. 

The word Black 
has geographic power, 
pulls everybody in: 
Blacks here-- 
Blacks there-- 
Blacks wherever they may be. 
And remember, you Blacks, what they told you-- 
remember your Education: 
"one Drop--one Drop 
maketh a brand new Black. 
         Oh mighty Drop. 
______And because they have given us kindly 
so many more of our people 

Blackness 
stretches over the land. 
Blackness-- 
the Black of it, 
the rust-red of it, 
the milk and cream of it, 
the tan and yellow-tan of it, 
the deep-brown middle-brown high-brown of it, 
the "olive and ochre of it-- 
Blackness 
marches on. 

The huge, the pungent object of our prime out-ride 
is to Comprehend, 
to salute and to Love the fact that we are Black, 
which is our "ultimate Reality, 
which is the lone ground 
from which our meaningful metamorphosis, 
from which our prosperous staccato, 
group or individual, can rise. 

Self-shriveled Blacks. 
Begin with gaunt and marvelous concession: 
YOU are our costume and our fundamental bone. 
       
      All of you-- 
      you COLORED ones, 
      you NEGRO ones, 
those of you who proudly cry 
      "I'm half INDian-- 
      those of you who proudly screech 
      "I'VE got the blood of George WASHington in MY veins 
      ALL of you-- 
            you proper Blacks, 
      you half-Blacks, 
      you wish-I-weren't Blacks, 
      Niggeroes and Niggerenes. 


      You.





The Accompanist
 

I've always worried about you--the man or woman   
at the piano bench,   
night after night receiving only such applause   
as the singer allows: a warm hand please,   
for my accompanist.   At concerts,   
as I watch your fingers on the keys,   
and how swiftly, how excellently   
you turn sheet music pages,   
track the singer's notes, cover the singer's flaws,   
I worry about whole lifetimes,   
most lifetimes   
lived in the shadows of reflected fame;   
but then the singer's voice dies   
and there are just your last piano notes,   
not resentful at all,   
carrying us to the end, into those heartfelt cheers   
that spring up in little patches from a thrilled audience   
like sudden wildflowers bobbing in a rain   
of steady clapping.   And I'm on my feet, also,   
clapping and cheering for the singer, yes,   
but, I think, partially likewise for you   
half-turned toward us, balanced on your black bench,   
modest, utterly well-rehearsed,   
still playing the part you've made yours.





Cutting Hair
 

She pays attention to the hair, not her fingers, and cuts herself   
once or twice a day.   Doesn't notice anymore, just if the blood   
starts flowing.   Says, Excuse me, to the customer and walks away   
for a band-aid.   Same spot on the middle finger over and over,   
raised like a callus.   Also the nicks where she snips between   
her fingers, the torn webbing.   Also spider veins on her legs now,   
so ugly, though she sits in a chair for half of each cut, rolls around   
from side to side.   At night in the winter she sleeps in white   
cotton gloves, Neosporin on the cuts, vitamin E, then heavy   
lotion.   All night, for weeks, her white hands lie clothed like   
those of a young girl going to her first party.   Sleeping alone,   
she opens and closes her long scissors and the hair falls under   
her hands.   It's a good living, kind of like an undertaker,   
the people keep coming, and the hair, shoulder length, French   
twist, braids.   Someone has to cut it.   At the end she whisks   
and talcums my neck.   Only then can I bend and see my hair,   
how it covers the floor, curls and clippings of brown and silver,   
how it shines like a field of scythed hay beneath my feet.





Finding a Bible in an Abandoned Cabin
 

Under dust plush as a moth's wing,   
the book's leather cover still darkly shown,   
and everywhere else but this spot was sodden   
beneath the roof's unraveling shingles.   
There was that back-of-the-neck lick of chill   
and then, from my index finger, the book   

opened like a blasted bird.   In its box   
of familiar and miraculous inks,   
a construction of filaments and dust,   
thoroughfares of worms, and a silage   
of silverfish husks:   in the autumn light,   
eight hundred pages of perfect wordless lace.





Fences
 

Mouths full of laughter,   
the turistas come to the tall hotel   
with suitcases full of dollars.   

Every morning my brother makes   
the cool beach new for them.   
With a wooden board he smooths   
away all footprints.   

I peek through the cactus fence   
and watch the women rub oil   
sweeter than honey into their arms and legs   
while their children jump waves   
or sip drinks from long straws,   
coconut white, mango yellow.   

Once my little sister   
ran barefoot across the hot sand   
for a taste.   

My mother roared like the ocean,   
"No. No. It's their beach.   
It's their beach.   






Evening
 

The light passes 
from ridge to ridge, 
from flower to flower-- 
the hepaticas, wide-spread 
under the light 
grow faint-- 
the petals reach inward, 
the blue tips bend 
toward the bluer heart 
and the flowers are lost. 

The cornel-buds are still white, 
but shadows dart 
from the cornel-roots-- 
black creeps from root to root, 
each leaf 
cuts another leaf on the grass, 
shadow seeks shadow, 
then both leaf 
and leaf-shadow are lost.





First Glance
 

The Lumieres' first movies were of ordinary life: 
workers leaving their father's factory; 
parents at the table while the baby eats. 
The brothers found the man's hands at work building a wall 
just as beautiful when played backwards, 
the man leaping into the water 
and equal delight when he rose again into the air. 
It's strange the brothers gave up so quickly on film, but they did. 
People would grow bored, they said, could see the same thing on the street. 
A novelty, they told their father, and returned to manufacturing.





ANWR
 

When we are out of gas, 
a headache haloes the roof, 
darkening the skin of everyone who has a full tank. 

I was told that the nectar of shoelaces, 
if squeezed hard enough, 
turns to water and trickles from the caribou's snout. 

A glacier nibbled from its center 
spiders a story of the Southern Cross, 
twin brothers 
dancing in the back room lit with cigarettes 
break through the drum's soft skin-- 
      There bone faces atlas 
            a grieving century.





River
 

When we river, 
blood fills cracks in bullet shells, 
oars become fingers scratching windows into dawn, 
and faces are stirred from mounds of mica. 

I notice the back isn't as smooth anymore, 
      the river crests at the moment of blinking; 
its blood vessels stiffen and spear the drenched coat of flies 
collecting outside the jaw. 

Night slows here, 
      the first breath held back, 
clenched like a tight fist in the arroyo under shattered glass. 
But we still want to shake the oxygen loose from flypaper, 
hack its veins, 
divert its course, 
      and reveal its broken back, 

the illusion of a broken back.





Wanting Sumptuous Heavens
 

No one grumbles among the oyster clans, 
And lobsters play their bone guitars all summer. 
Only we, with our opposable thumbs, want 
Heaven to be, and God to come, again. 
There is no end to our grumbling; we want 
Comfortable earth and sumptuous Heaven. 
But the heron standing on one leg in the bog 
Drinks his dark rum all day, and is content.





To a Waterfowl
 

          Whither, 'midst falling dew,

While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,

Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue

          Thy solitary way?


          Vainly the fowler's eye

Might mark thy distant flight, to do thee wrong,

As, darkly seen against the crimson sky,

          Thy figure floats along.


          Seek'st thou the plashy brink

Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,

Or where the rocking billows rise and sink

          On the chafd ocean side?


          There is a Power, whose care

Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,--

The desert and illimitable air

          Lone wandering, but not lost.


          All day thy wings have fanned,

At that far height, the cold thin atmosphere;

Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,

          Though the dark night is near.


          And soon that toil shall end,

Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,

And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,

          Soon, o'er thy sheltered nest.


          Thou'rt gone, the abyss of heaven

Hath swallowed up thy form, yet, on my heart

Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,

          And shall not soon depart.


          He, who, from zone to zone,

Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,

In the long way that I must trace alone,

          Will lead my steps aright.








God's World
 

O world, I cannot hold thee close enough! 
   Thy winds, thy wide grey skies! 
   Thy mists, that roll and rise! 
Thy woods, this autumn day, that ache and sag 
And all but cry with colour!   That gaunt crag 
To crush!   To lift the lean of that black bluff! 
World, World, I cannot get thee close enough! 

Long have I known a glory in it all, 
         But never knew I this;   
         Here such a passion is 
As stretcheth me apart,--Lord, I do fear 
Thou'st made the world too beautiful this year; 
My soul is all but out of me,--let fall 
No burning leaf; prithee, let no bird call. 







George Moore
 

In speaking of aspiration,'
   From the recesses of a pen more dolorous than blackness         
       itself,
      Were you presenting us with one more form of imperturbable 
          French drollery,
      Or was it self directed banter?
         Habitual ennui
            Took from you, your invisible, hot helmet of anaemia--
      While you were filling your little glass from the 
               decanter
            Of a transparent-murky, would-be-truthful hobohemia--
         And then facetiously
      Went off with it?   Your soul's supplanter,
   The spirit of good narrative, flatters you, convinced that 
            in reporting briefly
 One choice incident, you have known beauty other than that      
          of stys, on 
Which to fix your admiration.

                So far as the future is concerned,
 Shall not one say, with the Russian philosopher,
    How is one to know what one doesn't know?'
                So far as the present is concerned,

If external action is effete
    And rhyme is outmoded,
       I shall revert to you,
    Habakkuk, as on a recent occasion I was goaded
         Into doing, by XY, who was speaking of unrhymed                      
                  verse.
This man said--I think that I repeat
   His identical words:
      Hebrew poetry is
   Prose with a sort of heightened consciousness.   Ecstacy 
                affords
         The occasion and expediency determines the form.'







Those Various Scalpels
 

Those 
various sounds, consistently indistinct, like intermingled echoes 
   struck from thin glasses successively at random-- 
       the inflection disguised: your hair, the tails of two 
   fighting-cocks head to head in stone-- 
       like sculptured scimitars repeating the curve of your    
               ears in reverse order:    
                                                                        your eyes, 
             flowers of ice and snow 

sown by tearing winds on the cordage of disabled ships: your 
       raised hand 
an ambiguous signature: your cheeks, those rosettes 
   of blood on the stone floors of French chteaux, 
with regard to which the guides are so affirmative-- 
          your other hand 

a bundle of lances all alike, partly hid by emeralds from Persia 
    and the fractional magnificence of Florentine 
       goldwork--a collection of little objects-- 
sapphires set with emeralds, and pearls with a moonstone, made fine 
   with enamel in gray, yellow, and dragonfly blue; 
      a lemon, a pear 

and three bunches of grapes, tied with silver: your dress, a magnificent square 
cathedral tower of uniform 
   and at the same time diverse appearance--a 
species of vertical vineyard, rustling in the storm 
   of conventional opinion--are they weapons or scalpels? 
       Whetted to brilliance 

by the hard majesty of that sophistication which is superior to opportunity, 
these things are rich instruments with which to experiment. 
    But why dissect destiny with instruments 
    more highly specialized than the components of destiny 
            itself?





Art
 

In placid hours well-pleased we dream 
Of many a brave unbodied scheme. 
But form to lend, pulsed life create, 
What unlike things must meet and mate: 
A flame to melt--a wind to freeze; 
Sad patience--joyous energies; 
Humility--yet pride and scorn; 
Instinct and study; love and hate; 
Audacity--reverence. These must mate, 
And fuse with Jacob's mystic heart, 
To wrestle with the angel--Art.





Flammonde
 

The man Flammonde, from God knows where,
With firm address and foreign air,
With news of nations in his talk
And something royal in his walk,
With glint of iron in his eyes,
But never doubt, nor yet surprise,
Appeared, and stayed, and held his head
As one by kings accredited.

Erect, with his alert repose
About him, and about his clothes,
He pictured all tradition hears
Of what we owe to fifty years.
His cleansing heritage of taste
Paraded neither want nor waste;
And what he needed for his fee
To live, he borrowed graciously.

He never told us what he was,
Or what mischance, or other cause,
Had banished him from better days
To play the Prince of Castaways.
Meanwhile he played surpassing well
A part, for most, unplayable;
In fine, one pauses, half afraid
To say for certain that he played.

For that, one may as well forego
Conviction as to yes or no;
Nor can I say just how intense
Would then have been the difference
To several, who, having striven
In vain to get what he was given,
Would see the stranger taken on
By friends not easy to be won.

Moreover, many a malcontent
He soothed and found munificent;
His courtesy beguiled and foiled
Suspicion that his years were soiled;
His mien distinguished any crowd,
His credit strengthened when he bowed;
And women, young and old, were fond
Of looking at the man Flammonde.

There was a woman in our town
On whom the fashion was to frown;
But while our talk renewed the tinge
Of a long-faded scarlet fringe,
The man Flammonde saw none of that,
And what he saw we wondered at--
That none of us, in her distress,
Could hide or find our littleness.

There was a boy that all agreed
Had shut within him the rare seed
Of learning.   We could understand,
But none of us could lift a hand.
The man Flammonde appraised the youth,
And told a few of us the truth;
And thereby, for a little gold,
A flowered future was unrolled.

There were two citizens who fought
For years and years, and over nought;
They made life awkward for their friends,
And shortened their own dividends.
The man Flammonde said what was wrong
Should be made right; nor was it long
Before they were again in line,
And had each other in to dine.

And these I mention are but four
Of many out of many more.
So much for them.   But what of him--
So firm in every look and limb?
What small satanic sort of kink
Was in his brain?   What broken link
Withheld him from the destinies
That came so near to being his?

What was he, when we came to sift
His meaning, and to note the drift
Of incommunicable ways
That make us ponder while we praise?
Why was it that his charm revealed
Somehow the surface of a shield?
What was it that we never caught?
What was he, and what was he not?

How much it was of him we met
We cannot ever know; nor yet
Shall all he gave us quite atone
For what was his, and his alone;
Nor need we now, since he knew best,
Nourish an ethical unrest:
Rarely at once will nature give
The power to be Flammonde and live.

We cannot know how much we learn
From those who never will return,
Until a flash of unforeseen
Remembrance falls on what has been.
We've each a darkening hill to climb;
And this is why, from time to time
In Tilbury Town, we look beyond
Horizons for the man Flammonde.





Kosmos
 

Who includes diversity and is Nature, 
Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also, 
Who has not look'd forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing, 
Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover, 
Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the sthetic or intellectual, 
Who having consider'd the body finds all its organs and parts good, 
Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories, 
The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States; 
Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons, 
Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations, 
The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.





To the States,
 

To Identify the 16th, 17th, or 18th Presidentiad.
Why reclining, interrogating? why myself and all drowsing? 
What deepening twilight--scum floating atop of the waters, 
Who are they as bats and night-dogs askant in the capitol? 
What a filthy Presidentiad! (O South, your torrid suns! O North, your arctic freezings!) 
Are those really Congressmen? are those the great Judges? is that the President? 
Then I will sleep awhile yet, for I see that these States sleep, for reasons; 
(With gathering murk, with muttering thunder and lambent shoots we all duly awake, 
South, North, East, West, inland and seaboard, we will surely awake.)





Eurydice
 

I 

So you have swept me back, 
I who could have walked with the live souls 
above the earth, 
I who could have slept among the live flowers 
at last; 

so for your arrogance 
and your ruthlessness 
I am swept back 
where dead lichens drip 
dead cinders upon moss of ash; 

so for your arrogance 
I am broken at last, 
I who had lived unconscious, 
who was almost forgot; 

if you had let me wait 
I had grown from listlessness 
into peace, 
if you had let me rest with the dead, 
I had forgot you 
and the past. 

                               II 

Here only flame upon flame 
and black among the red sparks, 
streaks of black and light 
grown colourless; 

why did you turn back, 
that hell should be reinhabited 
of myself thus 
swept into nothingness? 

why did you glance back? 
why did you hesitate for that moment? 
why did you bend your face 
caught with the flame of the upper earth, 
above my face? 

what was it that crossed my face 
with the light from yours 
and your glance? 
what was it you saw in my face? 
the light of your own face, 
the fire of your own presence? 

What had my face to offer 
but reflex of the earth, 
hyacinth colour 
caught from the raw fissure in the rock 
where the light struck, 
and the colour of azure crocuses 
and the bright surface of gold crocuses 
and of the wind-flower, 
swift in its veins as lightning 
and as white. 

                               III 

Saffron from the fringe of the earth, 
wild saffron that has bent 
over the sharp edge of earth, 
all the flowers that cut through the earth, 
all, all the flowers are lost; 

everything is lost, 
everything is crossed with black, 
black upon black 
and worse than black, 
this colourless light. 

                               IV 

Fringe upon fringe 
of blue crocuses, 
crocuses, walled against blue of themselves, 
blue of that upper earth, 
blue of the depth upon depth of flowers, 
lost; 

flowers, 
if I could have taken once my breath of them, 
enough of them, 
more than earth, 
even than of the upper earth, 
had passed with me 
beneath the earth; 

if I could have caught up from the earth, 
the whole of the flowers of the earth, 
if once I could have breathed into myself 
the very golden crocuses 
and the red, 
and the very golden hearts of the first saffron, 
the whole of the golden mass, 
the whole of the great fragrance, 
I could have dared the loss. 

                              V 

So for your arrogance 
and your ruthlessness 
I have lost the earth   
and the flowers of the earth, 
and the live souls above the earth, 
and you who passed across the light 
and reached 
ruthless; 

you who have your own light, 
who are to yourself a presence, 
who need no presence; 

yet for all your arrogance 
and your glance, 
I tell you this: 

such loss is no loss, 
such terror, such coils and strands and pitfalls 
of blackness, 
such terror 
is no loss; 

hell is no worse than your earth 
above the earth, 
hell is no worse, 
no, nor your flowers 
nor your veins of light 
nor your presence, 
a loss; 

my hell is no worse than yours 
though you pass among the flowers and speak 
with the spirits above earth. 

                               VI 

Against the black 
I have more fervour 
than you in all the splendour of that place, 
against the blackness 
and the stark grey 
I have more light; 

and the flowers, 
if I should tell you, 
you would turn from your own fit paths 
toward hell, 
turn again and glance back 
and I would sink into a place 
even more terrible than this. 

                              VII 

At least I have the flowers of myself, 
and my thoughts, no god 
can take that; 
I have the fervour of myself for a presence 
and my own spirit for light; 

and my spirit with its loss 
knows this; 
though small against the black, 
small against the formless rocks, 
hell must break before I am lost; 

before I am lost, 
hell must open like a red rose 
for the dead to pass.





Sea Iris
 

I 

Weed, moss-weed, 
root tangled in sand, 
sea-iris, brittle flower, 
one petal like a shell 
is broken, 
and you print a shadow 
like a thin twig. 

Fortunate one, 
scented and stinging, 
rigid myrrh-bud, 
camphor-flower, 
sweet and salt--you are wind 
in our nostrils. 
            
                        II 

Do the murex-fishers 
drench you as they pass? 
Do your roots drag up colour 
from the sand? 
Have they slipped gold under you-- 
rivets of gold? 

Band of iris-flowers 
above the waves, 
you are painted blue, 
painted like a fresh prow 
stained among the salt weeds.





Human Cylinders
 

The human cylinders 
Revolving in the enervating dusk 
That wraps each closer in the mystery 
Of singularity 
Among the litter of a sunless afternoon 
Having eaten without tasting 
Talked without communion 
And at least two of us 
Loved a very little 
Without seeking 
To know if our two miseries 
In the lucid rush-together of automatons 
Could form one opulent wellbeing 

Simplifications of men 
In the enervating dusk 
Your indistinctness 
Serves me the core of the kernel of you 
When in the frenzied reaching out of intellect to intellect 
Leaning brow to brow       communicative 
Over the abyss of the potential 
Concordance of respiration 
Shames 
Absence of corresponding between the verbal sensory 
And reciprocity   
Of conception 
And expression 
Where each extrudes beyond the tangible 
One thin pale trail of speculation 
From among us we have sent out 
Into the enervating dusk 
One little whining beast 
Whose longing 
Is to slink back to antediluvian burrow 
And one elastic tentacle of intuition 
To quiver among the stars 

The impartiality of the absolute 
Routs      the polemic 
Or which of us 
Would not 
Receiving the holy-ghost 
Catch it      and caging 
Lose it 
Or in the problematic   
Destroy the Universe 
With a solution





Giovanni Franchi
 

The threewomen who all walked 
In the same dress 
And it had falling ferns on it 
Skipped parallel   
To the progress 
Of Giovanni Franchi 

Giovanni Franchi's wrists flicked 
Flickeringly as he flacked them 
His wrists explained things 
Infectiously by way of his adolescence 
His adolescence was all there was of him 
Whatever was left was rather awkward 
His adolescence tuned to the tops of trees 
Descended to the fallacious nobility 
Of his first pair of trousers 

They were tubular      flapped friezily 
The color of coppered mustard 
What matter 
Were they not the first 
No others could ever be the first again 
The ferns on the flounces of the threewomen 
Began fading as she thought of it 
Tea table problems for insane asylyms 
Are dmod 
Dmod 

Allow us to rely on our instincts 
The threewomen was composed of three instincts 
Each sniffing divergently directed draughts 
The first instinct    first again    (may 
Renascent gods save us from the enigmatic 
Penetralia of Firstness) 
Was to be faithful to a man       first 
The second       to be loyal to herself first 
She would have to find which self first 
The third which might as well have been first 
Was to find out how many toes the   
Philosopher Giovanni Bapini had       first 

Giovanni Franchi hooligan-faced and latin-born 
You imagine what he looked like 
Looked as nearly as he could as the   
Philosopher looked 
His articulations were excellent 
Still    where Giovanni Bapini was cymophanous 
Giovanni Franchi was merely pale 

He scuttled winsomely 
To its distribution from a puffer   
For the declaration of War 
His acolytian sincerity 
The sensitive down among his freckles 
Fell in with the patriotic souls of flags 
Red white and green flags      fillipping piazzas 
When the "National Idea arrived on the Milan Express 

Continually cutting off an angle from Paschkowski's 
Through plate-glass swingings 
To look as busy bodily 
As the philosopher's brain was 
As Giovanni Bapini importuned mobs 
From monumental gums 
To the sparky detritus 
From the hurried cigarette 
Of his disciple 
Whose papa and mama kept a trattoria 
Audaciously squatting right opposite the Pitti Palace 
The Pitti Palace however stolid      could hardly help noticing 
Being an aristocrat it went on looking 
As plainly piled up as ever 
The Pitti Palace has never been known to mention the trattoria 
Or mention Giovanni Franchi 
Sitting in it 
At a book 
It could not see from that distance 
Giovanni watching the munchers supporting his parents   
With an eye 
On assuring himself 
Of their sufficient impression 
By erudition 

He was so young 
That explains so much 
No book ever explained what to be young is 
But they look so much more important for that 
Giovanni was in continuous ecstacy 
Induced by the imposing look of them 
When Giovanni Bapini spoke of them 
He could not tell 
How completely more precious 
Would be such knowledge 
As how many toes the philosopher Giovanni Bapini had 

Now the threewomen 
For pity's sake 
Let us think of her as she    to save time 
Seeing the minor Giovanni 
Sitting at the major Giovanni's feet 
Made sure he must be counting his toes 
All to the contrary    he was picking the philosopher's brains 
Happy in the security that when he had done 
He would still be youthful enough to sort out his own 

He listened at the elder's lips 
That taught him of earthquakes and 
Of women-- 
His manners were abominable 
He would kill a woman 
Quite inconspicuously it is true 
And neglect to attend her funeral 
I mean the older man 
And what he told 
Giovanni Franchi 
About these pernicious persons 
Was so extremely good for him 
It entirely spoilt his first love-affair 
To such an extent          it never came off 

We have read of   
Trattoria    meaning eating house. 
Piazzas    or squares 
The Pitti Palace    enormous 
And Paschkowski's      for beer 
All are in Firenze 
Firenze is Florence 
Some think it is a woman with flowers in her hair 
But NO       it is a city with stones on the streets 

Giovanni Bapini often said 
Everybody in Firenze knows me 
And everybody did 
Excepting--That is      she didn't 
She never knew what he was 
Or how he was himself 
Yet she uniquely was the one 
To speculate      upon the number of his toes 
The days growing longer 
Fulfilling her of curiousity 

She made a moth's net 
Of metaphor and miracles 
And on the incandescent breath of civilizations 
She chased by moon-and-morn light 
Philosopher's toes 

As virginal      as had he never worn them 
Clear of white marks means money' 
All quicks and cores 
They fluttered to her fantasy 
Fell into her lap 
While she gathered her ferny flounces about them 
They inappropriately passed 

But Giovanni Franchi was there 
He almost winked it at her 
That he was there 
His eyes were intrepid with phantom secrets 
The Philosopher had flung to him 
And as she tripped by him 
She guessed      these all 
All    but the number of those toes 

She made diurnal pilgrimage 
To the trattoria 
To eat 
Trout    that might have been trained for circuses 
If minarets    grew in miniature whirlpools 
And mayonnaise       that helped her to forget 
That what is underneath       need never matter 

She put all minor riddles out of her 
Such as 
What was the under-cover of Franchi's book 
Telling to the plaid pattern of the tablecloth 
Too shy to interrogate 
She sent ambassadors 
To the disciple 
They returned 
Oh rats 
Quite manifest    that Giovanni Franchi 
Some semieffigy 
Damned by scholiums 
Knew no more      how many toes-- 
Than      Giovanni Bapini knew himself 







Randall Jarrell
 

The dream went like a rake of sliced bamboo, 
slats of dust distracted by a downdraw; 
I woke and knew I held a cigarette; 
I looked, there was none, could have been none; 
I slept off years before I woke again, 
palming the floor, shaking the sheets. I saw 
nothing was burning. I awoke, I saw 
I was holding two lighted cigarettes. . . . 
They come this path, old friends, old buffs of death. 
Tonight it's Randall, his spark still fire though humble, 
his gnawed wrist cradled like Kitten. "What kept you so long, 
racing the cooling grindstone of your ambition? 
You didn't write, you rewrote.... But tell me, 
Cal, why did we live? Why do we die?





Green Sees Things in Waves
 

Green first thing each day sees waves-- 
the chair, armoire, overhead fixtures, you name it, 
waves--which, you might say, things really are, 
but Green just lies there awhile breathing 
long slow breaths, in and out, through his mouth 
like he was maybe seasick, until in an hour or so 
the waves simmer down and then the trails and colors 
off of things, that all quiets down as well and Green 
starts to think of washing up, breakfast even 
with everything still moving around, colors, trails, 
and sounds, from the street and plumbing next door, 
vibrating--of course you might say that's what 
sound really is, after all, vibrations--but Green, 
he's not thinking physics at this stage, nuh-uh, 
our boy's only trying to get himself out of bed, 
get a grip, but sometimes, and this is the kicker, 
another party, shall we say, is in the room 
with Green, and Green knows this other party 
and they do not get along, which understates it 
quite a bit, quite a bit, and Green knows 
that this other cat is an hallucination, right, 
but these two have a routine that goes way back 
and Green starts hollering, throwing stuff 
until he's all shook up, whole day gone to hell, 
bummer . . . 

                         Anyhow, the docs are having a look, 
see if they can't dream up a cocktail, 
but seems our boy ate quite a pile of acid one time, 
clinical, wow, enough juice for half a block-- 
go go go, little Greenie--blew the wiring out 
from behind his headlights and now, no matter what, 
can't find the knob to turn off the show.





A Song
 

                         I

No riches from his scanty store
   My lover could impart;
He gave a boon I valued more --
   He gave me all his heart!

                         II

His soul sincere, his generous worth,
   Might well this bosom move;
And when I asked for bliss on earth,
   I only meant his love.

                         III

But now for me, in search of gain
   From shore to shore he flies;
Why wander riches to obtain,
   When love is all I prize?

                         IV

The frugal meal, the lowly cot
   If blest my love with thee!
That simple fare, that humble lot,
   Were more than wealth to me.

                         V

While he the dangerous ocean braves,
   My tears but vainly flow:
Is pity in the faithless waves
   To which I pour my woe?

                         VI

The night is dark, the waters deep,
   Yet soft the billows roll;
Alas! at every breeze I weep --
   The storm is in my soul.






To Mrs K____, On Her Sending Me an English Christmas Plum-Cake at Paris
 

What crowding thoughts around me wake,
What marvels in a Christmas-cake!
Ah say, what strange enchantment dwells
Enclosed within its odorous cells?
Is there no small magician bound
Encrusted in its snowy round?
For magic surely lurks in this,
A cake that tells of vanished bliss;
A cake that conjures up to view
The early scenes, when life was new;
When memory knew no sorrows past,
And hope believed in joys that last! --
Mysterious cake, whose folds contain
Life's calendar of bliss and pain;
That speaks of friends for ever fled,
And wakes the tears I love to shed.
Oft shall I breathe her cherished name
From whose fair hand the offering came:
For she recalls the artless smile
Of nymphs that deck my native isle;
Of beauty that we love to trace,
Allied with tender, modest grace;
Of those who, while abroad they roam,
Retain each charm that gladdens home,
And whose dear friendships can impart
A Christmas banquet for the heart!





Slavery
 

If Heaven has into being deigned to call
Thy light, O Liberty! to shine on all;
Bright intellectual Sun! why does thy ray
To earth distribute only partial day?
Since no resisting cause from spirit flows
Thy universal presence to oppose;
No obstacles by Nature's hand impressed,
Thy subtle and ethereal beams arrest;
Not swayed by matter is they course benign,
Or more direct or more oblique to shine;
Nor motion's laws can speed thy active course;
Nor strong repulsion's powers obstruct thy force:
Since there is no convexity in mind,
Why are thy genial rays to parts confined?
While the chill North with thy bright beam is blest,
Why should fell darkness half the South invest?
Was it decreed, fair Freedom! at thy birth,
That thou should'st ne'er irradiate all the earth?
While Britain basks in thy full blaze of light,
Why lies sad Afric quenched in total night?
   Thee only, sober Goddess! I attest,
In smiles chastised, and decent graces dressed;
To thee alone, pure daughter of the skies,
The hallowed incense of the Bard should rise:
Not that mad Liberty, in whose wild praise
Too oft he trims his prostituted bays;
Not that unlicensed monster of the crowd,
Whose roar terrific bursts in peals so loud,
Deafening the ear of Peace; fierce Faction's tool,
Of rash Sedition born, and mad Misrule;
Whose stubborn mouth, rejecting Reason's rein,
No strength can govern, and no skill restrain;
Whose magic cries the frantic vulgar draw
To spurn at Order, and to outrage Law;
To tread on grave Authority and Power,
And shake the work of ages in an hour:
Convulsed her voice, and pestilent her breath,
She raves of mercy, while she deals out death:
Each blast is fate; she darts from either hand
Red conflagration o'er the astonished land;
Clamouring for peace, she rends the air with noise,
And, to reform a part, the whole destroys.
Reviles oppression only to oppress,
And, in the act of murder, breathes redress.
Such have we seen on Freedom's genuine coast,
Bellowing for blessings which were never lost.
Tis past, and Reason rules the lucid hour,
And beauteous Order reassumes his power:
Lord of the bright ascendant may he reign,
Till perfect Peace eternal sway maintain!
   O, plaintive Southerne! whose impassioned page 
Can melt the soul to grief, or rouse to rage;
Now, when congenial themes engage the Muse,
She burns to emulate thy generous views;
Her failing efforts mock her fond desires,
She shares thy feelings, not partakes thy fires.
Strange power of song! the strain that warms the heart
Seems the same inspiration to impart;
Touched by the extrinsic energy alone,
We think the flame which melts us is our own;
Deceived, for genius we mistake delight,
Charmed as we read, we fancy we can write.
   Though not to me, sweet Bard, thy powers belong,
The cause I plead shall sanctify my song.
The Muse awakes no artificial fire,
For Truth rejects what Fancy would inspire:
Here Art would weave her gayest flowers in vain,
The bright invention Nature would disdain.
For no fictitious ills these numbers flow,
But living anguish, and substantial woe;
No individual griefs my bosom melt,
For millions feel what Oroonoko felt:
Fired by no single wrongs, the countless host
I mourn, by rapine dragg'd from Afric's coast.
Perish the illiberal thought which would debase
The native genius of the sable race!
Perish the proud philosophy, which sought
To rob them of the powers of equal thought!
What! does the immortal principle within
Change with the casual colour of a skin?
Does matter govern spirit? or is mind
Degraded by the form to which it's joined?
   No: they have heads to think, and hearts to feel,
And souls to act, with firm, though erring zeal;
For they have keen affections, soft desires,
Love strong as death, and active patriot fires:
All the rude energy, the fervid flame
Of high-souled passion, and ingenuous shame:
Strong, but luxuriant virtues, boldly shoot
From the wild vigour of a savage root.
   Nor weak their sense of honour's proud control,
For pride is virtue in a Pagan soul;
A sense of worth, a conscience of desert,
A high, unbroken haughtiness of heart; 
That selfsame stuff which erst proud empires swayed,
Of which the conquerors of the world were made.
Capricious fate of men! that very pride
In Afric scourged, in Rome was deified.
   No Muse, O Qua-shi! shall thy deeds relate,
No statue snatch thee from oblivious fate!
For thou wast born where never gentle Muse
On Valour's grave the flowers of Genius strews;
And thou wast born where no recording page
Plucks the fair deed from Time's devouring rage.
Had fortune placed you on some happier coast,
Where polished Pagans souls heroic boast,
To thee, who sought'st a voluntary grave,
The uninjured honours of thy name to save,
Whose generous arm thy barbarous Master spared,
Altars had smoked, and temples had been reared.
   Whene'er to Afric's shores I turn my eyes,
Horrors of deepest, deadliest guilt arise;
I see, by more than Fancy's mirror shown,
The burning village, and the blazing town:
See the dire victim torn from social life,
See the sacred infant, hear the shrieking wife!
She, wretch forlorn! is dragged by hostile hands,
To distant tyrants sold, in distant lands:
Transmitted miseries, and successive chains,
The sole sad heritage her child obtains.
E'en this last wretched boon their foes deny,
To weep together, or together die.
By felon hands, by one relentless stroke,
See the fond links of Nature broke!
The fibres twisting round a parent's heart,
Torn from their grasp, and bleeding as they part.                         
   Hold, murderers! hold! nor aggravate distress;
Respect the passions you yourself possess:
Ev'n you, of ruffian heart, and ruthless hand,
Love your own offspring, love your native land;
Ev'n you, with fond impatient feelings burn,
Though free as air, though certain of return.
Then, if to you, who voluntary roam,
So dear the memory of your distant home,
O think how absence the loved scene endears
To him, whose food is groan, whose drink is tears;
Think on the wretch whose aggravated pains
To exile misery adds, to misery chains.
If warm your heart, to British feelings true,
As dear his land to him as yours to you;
And Liberty, in you a hallowed flame,
Burns, unextinguished, in his breast the same.
Then leave him holy Freedom's cheering smile,
The heaven-taught fondness for the parent soil;
Revere affections mingled with our frame,
In every nature, every clime the same;
In all, these feelings equal sway maintain;
In all, the love of home and freedom reign:
And Tempe's vale, and parched Angola's sand,
One equal fondness of their sons command.
The unconquered savage laughs at pain and toil,
Basking in Freedom's beams which gild his native soil.
   Does thirst of empire, does desire of fame,                      
(For these are specious crimes) our rage inflame?
No: sordid lust of gold their fate controls,
The basest appetite of basest souls;
Gold, better gained by what their ripening sky,
Their fertile fields, their arts, and mines supply.                   
   What wrongs, what injuries does Oppression plead
To smooth the crime and sanctify the deed?
What strange offence, what aggravated sin?
They stand convicted -- of a darker skin!
Barbarians, hold! the opprobrious commerce spare,                   
Respect His sacred image which they bear.
Though dark and savage, ignorant and blind,
They claim the common privilege of kind;
Let Malice strip them of each other plea,
They still are men, and men should still be free.                
Insulted Reason loathes the inverted trade --
Loathes, as she views the human purchase made;
The outraged Goddess, with abhorrent eyes,
Sees Man the traffic, souls the merchandise!
Man, whom fair Commerce taught with judging eye,
And liberal hand, to barter or to buy,
Indignant Nature blushes to behold,
Degraded man himself, trucked, bartered, sold;
Of every native privilege bereft,
Yet cursed with every wounded feeling left.
Hard lot! each brutal suffering to sustain,
Yet keep the sense acute of human pain.
Plead not, in reason's palpable abuse,
Their sense of feeling callous and obtuse,
From heads to hearts lies Nature's plain appeal,
Though few can reason, all mankind can feel.
Though wit may boast a livelier dread of shame,
A loftier sense of wrong, refinement claim;
Though polished manners may fresh wants invent,
And nice distinctions nicer souls torment;
Though these on finer spirits heavier fall,
Yet natural evils are the same to all.
Though wounds there are which reason's force may heal,
There needs no logic sure to make us feel.
The nerve, howe'er untutored, can sustain
A sharp, unutterable sense of pain;
As exquisitely fashioned in a slave,
As where unequal fate a sceptre gave.
Sense is as keen where Gambia's waters glide,
As where proud Tiber rolls his classic tide.
Though verse or rhetoric point the feeling line,
They do not whet sensation, but define.
Did ever wretch less feel the galling chain,
When Zeno proved there was no ill in pain?
In vain the sage to smooth its horror tries;
Spartans and Helots see with different eyes;
Their miseries philosophic quirks deride,
Slaves groan in pangs disowned by Stoic pride.
   When the fierce Sun darts vertical his beams,
And thirst and hunger mix their wild extremes;
When the sharp iron wounds his inmost soul,
And his strained eyes in burning anguish roll;
Will the parched Negro own, ere he expire,
No pain in hunger, and no heat in fire?
   For him, when agony his frame destroys,
What hope of present fame or future joys?
For that have heroes shortened Nature's date;
For this have martyrs gladly met their fate;                     
But him, forlorn, no hero's pride sustains,
No martyr's blissful visions soothe his pains;
Sullen, he mingles with his kindred dust,
For he has learned to dread the Christian's trust;
To him what mercy can that God display,
Whose servants murder, and whose sons betray?
Savage! thy venial error I deplore,
They are not Christians who infest thy shore.
   O thou sad spirit, whose preposterous yoke
The great deliver Death, at length, has broke!
Released from misery, and escaped from care,
Go, meet that mercy man denied thee here.
In thy dark home, sure refuge of the oppressed,
The wicked vex not, and the weary rest.
And, if some notions, vague and undefined,
Of future terrors have assailed thy mind;
If such thy masters have presumed to teach,
As terrors only they are prone to preach;
(For should they paint eternal Mercy's reign,
Where were the oppressor's rod, the captive's chain?)                      
If then, thy troubled soul has learned to dread
The dark unknown thy trembling footsteps tread;
On Him, who made thee what thou art, depend;
He, who withholds the means, accepts the end.
Thy mental night they Saviour will not blame,
He died for those who never heard his name.
Not thine the reckoning dire of Light abused,
Knowledge disgraced, and Liberty misused;
On thee no awful judge incensed shall sit
For parts perverted, and dishonoured wit.
Where ignorance will be found the surest plea,
How many learned and wise shall envy thee!
   And thou, White Savage! whether lust of gold,
Or lust of conquest rule thee uncontrolled!
Hero, or robber! -- by whatever name
Thou plead thy impious claim to wealth or fame;
Whether inferior mischief be thy boast,
A tyrant trader rifling Congo's coast:
Or bolder carnage track thy crimson way,
Kings dispossessed, and provinces thy prey;
Whether thou pant to tame earth's distant bound;
All Cortez murdered, all Columbus found;
O'er plundered realms to reign, detested Lord,
Make millions wretched, and thyself abhorred: --
Whether Cartouche in forests break the law,
Or bolder Caesar keep the world in awe;
In Reason's eye, in Wisdom's fair account,
Your sum of glory boasts a like amount:
The means may differ, but the end's the same;
Conquest is pillage with a nobler name.
Who makes the sum of human blessings less,
Or sinks the stock of general happiness,
Though erring fame may grace, though false renown,
His life may blazon or his memory crown,
Yet the last audit shall reverse the cause,
And God shall vindicate his broken laws.
   Had those adventurous spirits who explore
Through ocean's trackless wastes, the far-sought shore;
Whether of wealth insatiate, or of power,
Conquerors who waste, or ruffians who devour:
Had these possessed, O Cook! thy gentle mind,
Thy love of arts, thy love of human kind;
Had these pursued thy mild and liberal plan,
Discoverers had not been a curse to man.
Then, blessed Philanthropy! thy social hands
Had linked dissevered worlds in brothers' bands;
Careless, if colour, or if clime divide;
Then, loved and loving, man had lived, and died.
Then with pernicious skill we had not known
To bring their vices back and leave our own.
   The purest wreaths which hang on glory's shrine,
For empires founded, peaceful Penn! are thine;
No blood-stained laurels crowned thy virtuous toil,
No slaughtered natives drenched thy fair-earned soil.
Still thy meek spirit in thy flock survives,
Consistent still, their doctrines rule their lives;
Thy followers only have effaced the shame
Inscribed by slavery on the Christian name.
   Shall Britain, where the soul of Freedom reigns,
Forge chains for others she herself disdains?
Forbid it, Heaven! O let the nations know
The liberty she tastes she will bestow;
Not to herself the glorious gift confined,
She spreads the blessing wide as human kind;
And scorning narrow views of time and place,
Bids all be free in earth's extended space.
   What page of human annals can record
A deed so bright as human rights restored?
O may that god-like deed, that shining page,
Redeem our fame, and consecrate our age!
And let this glory mark our favoured shore,
To curb false freedom and the true restore!
   And see, the cherub Mercy from above,
Descending softly, quits the spheres of love!
On Britain's isle she sheds her heavenly dew,
And breathes her spirit o'er the enlightened few;
From soul to soul the spreading influence steals,
Till every breast the soft contagion feels.
She speeds, exulting, to the burning shore,
With the best message angel ever bore;
Hark! 'tis the note which spoke a Saviour's birth,
Glory to God on high, and peace on earth!
She vindicates the Power in Heaven adored,
She stills the clank of chains, and sheathes the sword;
She cheers the mourner, and with soothing hands
From bursting hearts unbinds the oppressor's bands;
Restores the lustre of the Christian name,
And clears the foulest blot that dimmed its fame.
   As the mild Spirit hovers o'er the coast,
A fresher hue the withered landscapes boast;
Her healing smiles the ruined scenes repair,
And blasted Nature wears a joyous air;
While she proclaims through all their spicy groves,
Henceforth your fruits, your labours, and your loves,
All that your Sire possessed, or you have sown,
Sacred from plunder -- all is now your own.'
   And now, her high commission from above,
Stamped with the holy characters of love,
The meek-eyed spirit waving in her hand,
Breathes manumission o'er the rescued land:
She tears the banner stained with blood and tears,
And, Liberty! thy shining standard rears!
As the bright ensign's glory she displays,
See pale Oppression faints beneath the blaze!
The giant dies! no more his frown appals,
The chain, untouched, drops off, the fetter falls.
Astonished echo tells the vocal shore,
Oppression's fallen, and slavery is no more!                      
The dusky myriads crowd the sultry plain,
And hail that mercy long invoked in vain.
Victorious power! she bursts their two-fold bands,
And Faith and Freedom spring from Britain's hands.
   And Thou! great source of Nature and of Grace,
Who of one blood didst form the human race,
Look down in mercy in thy chosen time,
With equal eye on Afric's suffering clime:
Disperse her shades of intellectual night,
Repeat thy high behest -- Let there be light!
Bring each benighted soul, great God, to Thee,
And with thy wide Salvation make them free!






The Hackney Coachman: Or the Way to Get a Good Fare
 

I am a bold Coachman, and drive a good hack, 
With a coat of five capes that quite covers my back; 
And my wife keeps a sausage-shop, not many miles 
From the narrowest alley in all Broad St Giles. 

Though poor, we are honest and very content, 
We pay as we go for meat, drink, and for rent; 
To work all the week I am able and willing, 
I never get drunk, and I waste not a shilling. 

And while at a tavern my gentleman tarries, 
The coachman grows richer than he whom he carries; 
And I'd rather (said I), since it saves me from sin, 
Be the driver without, than the toper within. 

Yet though dram-shops I hate, and the dram-drinking friend, 
I'm not quite so good but I wish I may mend; 
I repent of my sins, since we all are depraved, 
For a coachman, I hold, has a soul to be saved. 

When a riotous multitude fills up a street, 
And the greater part know not, boys, wherefore they meet; 
If I see there is mischief, I never go there, 
Let others get tipsy so I get my fare. 

Now to church, if I take some good lady to pray, 
It grieves me full sore to be kept quite away; 
So I step within side, though the sermon's begun, 
For a slice of the service is better than none. 

Then my glasses are whole, and my coach is so neat, 
I am always the first to be called in the street; 
And I'm known by the name ('tis a name rather rare) 
Of the coachman that never asks more than his fare. 

Though my beasts should be dull, yet I don't use them ill; 
Though they stumble I swear not, nor cut them up hill; 
For I firmly believe there's no charm in an oath 
That can make a nag trot, when to walk he is loath. 

And though I'm a coachman, I'll freely confess, 
I beg of my Maker my labours to bless; 
I praise Him each morning, and pray every night, 
And 'tis this makes my heart feel so cheerful and light. 

When I drive to a funeral I care not for drink; 
That is not the moment to guzzle, but think; 
And I wish I could add both of coachman and master, 
That both of us strove to amend a bit faster.





A Reverie
 

Beside a spreading elm, from whose high boughs 
Like knotted tufts the crow's light dwelling shows, 
Where screened from northern blasts, and winter-proof, 
Snug stands the parson's barn with thatched roof; 
At chaff-strewed door where, in the morning ray, 
The gilded motes in mazy circles play, 
And sleepy Comrade in the sun is laid, 
More grateful to the cur than neighbouring shade. 
In snowy shirt unbraced, brown Robin stood, 
And leant upon his flail in thoughtful mood: 
His full round cheek where deeper flushes glow, 
The dewy drops which glisten on his brow; 
His dark cropped pate that erst at church or fair, 
So smooth and silky, showed his morning's care, 
Which, all uncouth in matted locks combined, 
Now, ends erect, defies the ruffling wind; 
His neck-band loose, and hosen rumpled low, 
A careful lad, nor slack at labour, show. 
Nor scraping chickens chirping 'mongst the straw, 
Nor croaking rook o'erhead, nor chattering daw; 
Loud-breathing cow amongst the rampy weeds, 
Nor grunting sow that in the furrows feeds: 
Nor sudden breeze that shakes the quaking leaves, 
And lightly rustles through the scattered sheaves; 
Nor floating straw that skims athwart his nose, 
The deeply-musing youth may discompose. 
For Nelly fair, the blithest village maid, 
Whose tuneful voice beneath the hedgerow-shade, 
At early milking, o'er the meadows borne, 
E'er cheered the ploughman's toil at rising morn: 
The neatest maid that e'er, in linen gown, 
Bore cream and butter to the market town: 
The tightest lass, that with untutored air, 
E'er footed alehouse floor at wake or fair, 
Since Easter last had Robin's heart possessed, 
And many a time disturbed his nightly rest. 
Full oft, returning from the loosened plough, 
He slacked his pace, and knit his thoughtful brow; 
And oft, ere half his thresher's talk was o'er, 
Would muse, with arms across, at cooling door: 
His mind thus bent, with downcast eyes he stood, 
And leant upon his flail in thoughtful mood. 
His soul o'er many a soft rememberance ran, 
And, muttering to himself, the youth began. 

   Ah! happy is the man whose early lot 
Hath made him master of a furnished cot; 
Who trains the vine that round his window grows, 
And after setting sun his garden hoes; 
Whose wattled pales his own enclosure shield, 
Who toils not daily in another's field. 
Wheree'er he goes, to church or market-town, 
With more respect he and his dog are known; 
A brisker face he wears at wake or fair, 
Nor views with longing eyes the pedlar's ware, 
But buys at will or ribbands, gloves or beads, 
And willing maidens to the alehouse leads; 
And, oh! secure from toils which cumber life, 
He makes the maid he loves an easy wife. 
Ah, Nelly! canst thou, with contented mind, 
Become the helpmate of a labouring hind, 
And share his lot, whate'er the chances be, 
Who hath no dower but love to fix on thee? 
Yes, gayest maid may meekest matron prove, 
And things of little note may 'token love. 
When from the church thou cam'st at eventide 
And I and red-haired Susan by thy side, 
I pulled the blossoms from the bending tree, 
And some to Susan gave, and some to thee; 
Thine were the best, and well thy smiling eye 
The difference marked, and guessed the reason why. 
When on a holiday we rambling strayed, 
And passed old Hodge's cottage in the glade; 
Neat was the garden dressed, sweet hummed the bee, 
I wished both cot and Nelly made for me; 
And well methought thy very eyes revealed 
The self-same wish within thy breast concealed. 
When artful, once, I sought my love to tell, 
And spoke to thee of one who loved thee well, 
You saw the cheat, and jeering homeward hied, 
Yet secret pleasure in thy looks I spied. 
Ay, gayest maid may meekest matron prove, 
And smaller signs than these have 'tokened love.' 

   Now, at a distance, on the neighbouring plain, 
With creaking wheels slow comes the heavy wain: 
High on its towering load a maid appears, 
And Nelly's voice sounds shrill in Robin's ears. 
Quick from his hand he throws the cumbrous flail, 
And leaps with lightsome limbs the enclosing pale. 
O'er field and fence he scours, and furrows wide, 
With wakened Comrade barking by his side; 
Whilst tracks of trodden grain, and sidelong hay, 
And broken hedge-flowers sweet, mark his impetuous way. 






A Disappointment
 

On village green whose smooth and well-worn sod, 
Cross pathed, with many a gossip's foot is trod; 
By cottage door where playful children run, 
And cats and curs sit basking in the sun; 
Where o'er an earthen seat the thorn is bent, 
Cross-armed and back to wall poor William leant 
His bonnet all awry, his gathered brow, 
His hanging lip and lengthened visage show 
A mind but ill at ease. With motions strange 
His listless limbs their wayward postures change; 
While many a crooked line and curious maze 
With clouted shoon he on the sand portrays. 
At length the half-chewed straw fell from his mouth, 
And to himself low spoke the moody youth. 

   How simple is the lad and reft of skill, 
Who thinks with love to fix a woman's will: 
Who every Sunday morn, to please her sight, 
Knots up his neckcloth gay and hosen white; 
Who for her pleasure keeps his pockets bare, 
And half his wages spends on pedlar's ware; 
When every niggard clown or dotard old, 
Who hides in secret nooks his oft-told gold, 
Whose field or orchard tempts, with all her pride, 
At little cost may win her for his bride! 
While all the meed her silly lover gains, 
Is but the neighbours' jeering for his pains. 
On Sunday last, when Susan's banns were read, 
And I astonished sat with hanging head, 
Cold grew my shrinking frame, and loose my knee, 
While every neighbour's eye was fixed on me. 
Ah Sue! when last we worked at Hodge's hay, 
And still at me you mocked in wanton play -- 
When last at fair, well pleased by chapman's stand, 
You took the new-bought fairing from my hand -- 
When at old Hobb's you sung that song so gay, 
Sweet William,' still the burthen of the lay, -- 
I little thought, alas! the lots were cast, 
That thou shouldst be another's bride at last; 
And had, when last we tripped it on the green, 
And laughed at stiff-backed Rob, small thought I ween, 
Ere yet another scanty month was flown 
To see thee wedded to the hateful clown. 
Ay, lucky churl! more gold thy pockets line, 
But did these shapely limbs resemble thine, 
I'd stay at home and tend the household gear, 
Nor on the green with other lads appear. 
Ay, lucky churl! no store thy cottage lacks, 
And round thy barn thick stand the sheltered stacks. 
But did such features coarse my visage grace, 
I'd never budge the bonnet from my face. 
Yet let it be; it shall not break my ease, 
He best deserves who doth the maiden please. 
Such silly cause no more shall give me pain, 
Nor ever maiden cross my rest again. 
Such grizzled suitors with their taste agree, 
And the black fiend may take them all for me!' 

Now through the village rose confused sounds, 
Hoarse lads, and children shrill, and yelping hounds. 
Straight every housewife at her door is seen, 
And pausing hedgers on their mattocks lean. 
At every narrow lane and alley's mouth 
Loud-laughing lasses stand, and joking youth. 
A bridal band tricked out in colours gay, 
With minstrels blithe before to cheer the way, 
From clouds of curling dust that onward fly, 
In rural splendour break upon the eye. 
As in their way they hold so gaily on, 
Caps, beads, and buttons, glancing in the sun, 
Each village wag with eye of roguish cast, 
Some maiden jogs and vents the ready jest; 
While village toasts the passing belles deride, 
And sober matrons marvel at their pride. 
But William, head erect, with settled brow, 
In sullen silence viewed the passing show; 
And oft he scratched his pate with careless grace, 
And scorned to pull the bonnet o'er his face; 
But did with steady look unaltered wait, 
Till hindmost man had passed the churchyard gate, 
Then turned him to his cot with visage flat, 
Where honest Lightfoot on the threshold sat. 
Up leaped the kindly beast his hand to lick, 
And for his pains received an angry kick. 
Loud shuts the door with harsh and thundering din; 
The echoes round their circling course begin, 
From cot to cot, church tower, and rocky dell, 
It grows amain with wide progressive swell, 
And Lightfoot joins the coil with long and piteous yell.





A Mother to Her Waking Infant
 

Now in thy dazzling half-oped eye, 
Thy curled nose and lip awry, 
Uphoisted arms and noddling head, 
And little chin with crystal spread, 
Poor helpless thing! what do I see, 
That I should sing of thee? 

From thy poor tongue no accents come, 
Which can but rub thy toothless gum: 
Small understanding boasts thy face, 
Thy shapeless limbs nor step nor grace: 
A few short words thy feats may tell, 
And yet I love thee well. 

When wakes the sudden bitter shriek, 
And redder swells thy little cheek 
When rattled keys thy woes beguile, 
And through thine eyelids gleams the smile, 
Still for thy weakly self is spent 
Thy little silly plaint. 

But when thy friends are in distress. 
Thou'lt laugh and chuckle n'ertheless, 
Nor with kind sympathy be smitten, 
Though all are sad but thee and kitten; 
Yet puny varlet that thou art, 
Thou twitchest at the heart. 

Thy smooth round cheek so soft and warm; 
Thy pinky hand and dimpled arm; 
Thy silken locks that scantly peep, 
With gold tipped ends, where circle deep, 
Around thy neck in harmless grace, 
So soft and sleekly hold their place, 
Might harder hearts with kindness fill, 
And gain our right goodwill. 

Each passing clown bestows his blessing, 
Thy mouth is worn with old wives' kissing; 
E'en lighter looks the gloomy eye 
Of surly sense when thou art by; 
And yet, I think, whoe'er they be, 
They love thee not like me. 

Perhaps when time shall add a few 
Short years to thee, thou'lt love me too; 
And after that, through life's long way, 
Become my sure and cheering stay; 
Wilt care for me and be my hold, 
When I am weak and old. 

Thou'lt listen to my lengthened tale, 
And pity me when I am frail -- 
But see, the sweepy spinning fly 
Upon the window takes thine eye. 
Go to thy little senseless play; 
Thou dost not heed my lay. 






Song
 

What voice is this, thou evening gale! 
That mingles with thy rising wail; 
And, as it passes, sadly seems 
The faint return of youthful dreams? 

Though now its strain is wild and drear, 
Blithe was it once as sky-lark's cheer -- 
Sweet as the night-bird's sweetest song, -- 
Dear as the lisp of infant's tongue. 

It was the voice, at whose sweet flow 
The heart did beat, and cheek did glow, 
And lip did smile, and eye did weep, 
And motioned love the measure keep. 

Oft be thy sound, soft gale of even, 
Thus to my wistful fancy given; 
And, as I list the swelling strain, 
The dead shall seem to live again!





Address to A Child During A Boisterous Winter Evening
 

What way does the wind come? What way does he go?
He rides over the water, and over the snow,
Through wood, and through vale; and o'er rocky height,
Which the goat cannot climb, takes his sounding flight;
He tosses about in every bare tree,
As, if you look up, you plainly may see;
But how he will come, and whither he goes,
There's never a scholar in England knows.

He will suddenly stop in a cunning nook,
And ring a sharp 'larum; but, if you should look,
There's nothing to see but a cushion of snow,
Round as a pillow, and whiter than milk,
And softer than if it were covered with silk.
Sometimes he'll hide in the cave of a rock,
Then whistle as shrill as the buzzard cock;
-- Yet seek him, and what shall you find in the place?
Nothing but silence and empty space;
Save, in a corner, a heap of dry leaves,
That he's left, for a bed, to beggars or thieves!

As soon as 'tis daylight tomorrow, with me
You shall go to the orchard, and then you will see
That he has been there, and made a great rout,
And cracked the branches, and strewn them about;
Heaven grant that he spare but that one upright twig
That looked up at the sky so proud and big
All last summer, as well you know,
Studded with apples, a beautiful show!

Hark! over the roof he makes a pause,
And growls as if he would fix his claws
Right in the slates, and with a huge rattle
Drive them down, like men in a battle:
 But let him range round; he does us no harm,
We build up the fire, we're snug and warm;
Untouched by his breath see the candle shines bright,
And burns with a clear and steady light.

Books have we to read, but that half-stifled knell,
Alas! 'tis the sound of the eight o'clock bell.
-- Come, now we'll to bed! and when we are there
He may work his own will, and what shall we care?
He may knock at the door -- we'll not let him in;
May drive at the windows -- we'll laugh at his din;
Let him seek his own home wherever it be;
Here's a cozie warm house for Edward and me.






The Mothers Return
 

A month, sweet Little-ones, is past 
Since your dear Mother went away, 
And she tomorrow will return; 
Tomorrow is the happy day. 

O blessed tidings! thoughts of joy! 
The eldest heard with steady glee; 
Silent he stood; then laughed amain, 
And shouted, Mother, come to me!' 

Louder and louder did he shout, 
With witless hope to bring her near! 
Nay, patience! patience, little boy; 
Your tender mother cannot hear.' 

I told of hills, and far-off towns, 
And long, long vales to travel through; 
He listened, puzzled, sore perplexed, 
But he submits; what can he do? 

No strike disturbs his sister's breast; 
She wars not with the mystery 
Of time and distance, night and day; 
The bonds of our humanity. 

Her joy is like an instinct, joy 
Of kitten, bird, or summer fly; 
She dances, runs without an aim, 
She chatters in her ecstasy. 

Her brother now takes up the note, 
And echoes back his sister's glee; 
They hug the infant in my arms, 
As if to force his sympathy. 

Then, settling into fond discourse, 
We rested in the garden bower; 
While sweetly shone the evening sun 
In his departing hour. 

We told o'er all that we had done, 
Our rambles by the swift brook's side 
Far as the willow-skirted pool, 
Where two fair swans together glide. 

We talked of change, of winter gone, 
Of green leaves on the hawthorn spray, 
Of birds that build their nests and sing. 
And all since Mother went away!' 

To her these tales they will repeat, 
To her our new-born tribes will show, 
The goslings green, the ass's colt, 
The lambs that in the meadow go. 

-- But see, the evening star comes forth! 
To bed the children must depart; 
A moment's heaviness they feel, 
A sadness at the heart: 

'Tis gone -- and in a merry fit 
They run up stairs in gamesome race; 
I, too, infected by their mood, 
I could have joined the wanton chase. 

Five minutes past -- and, O the change! 
Asleep upon their beds they lie; 
Their busy limbs in perfect rest, 
And closed the sparkling eye.

Floating Island
 

Harmonious Powers with Nature work 
On sky, earth, river, lake, and sea: 
Sunshine and storm, whirlwind and breeze 
All in one duteous task agree. 

Once did I see a slip of earth, 
By throbbing waves long undermined, 
Loosed from its hold; -- how no one knew 
But all might see it float, obedient to the wind. 

Might see it, from the mossy shore 
Dissevered float upon the Lake, 
Float, with its crest of trees adorned 
On which the warbling birds their pastime take. 

Food, shelter, safety there they find 
There berries ripen, flowerets bloom; 
There insects live their lives -- and die: 
A peopled world it is; in size a tiny room. 

And thus through many seasons' space 
This little Island may survive 
But Nature, though we mark her not, 
Will take away -- may cease to give. 

Perchance when you are wandering forth 
Upon some vacant sunny day 
Without an object, hope, or fear, 
Thither your eyes may turn -- the Isle is passed away. 

Buried beneath the glittering Lake! 
Its place no longer to be found, 
Yet the lost fragments shall remain, 
To fertilize some other ground. 






Loving and Liking: Irregular Verses Addressed to a Child
 

There's more in words than I can teach: 
Yet listen, Child! -- I would not preach; 
But only give some plain directions 
To guide your speech and your affections. 
Say not you love a roasted fowl 
But you may love a screaming owl, 
And, if you can, the unwieldy toad 
That crawls from his secure abode 
Within the mossy garden wall 
When evening dews begin to fall, 
Oh! mark the beauty of his eye: 
What wonders in that circle lie! 
So clear, so bright, our fathers said 
He wears a jewel in his head! 
And when, upon some showery day, 
Into a path or public way 
A frog leaps out from bordering grass, 
Startling the timid as they pass, 
Do you observe him, and endeavour 
To take the intruder into favour: 
Learning from him to find a reason 
For a light heart in a dull season. 
And you may love him in the pool, 
That is for him a happy school, 
In which he swims as taught by nature, 
Fit pattern for a human creature, 
Glancing amid the water bright, 
And sending upward sparkling light. 

   Nor blush if o'er your heart be stealing 
A love for things that have no feeling: 
The spring's first rose by you espied, 
May fill your breast with joyful pride; 
And you may love the strawberry-flower, 
And love the strawberry in its bower; 
But when the fruit, so often praised 
For beauty, to your lip is raised, 
Say not you love the delicate treat, 
But like it, enjoy it, and thankfully eat. 

   Long may you love your pensioner mouse, 
Though one of a tribe that torment the house: 
Nor dislike for her cruel sport the cat 
Deadly foe both of mouse and rat; 
Remember she follows the law of her kind, 
And Instinct is neither wayward nor blind. 
Then think of her beautiful gliding form, 
Her tread that would scarcely crush a worm, 
And her soothing song by the winter fire, 
Soft as the dying throb of the lyre. 

   I would not circumscribe your love: 
It may soar with the Eagle and brood with the dove, 
May pierce the earth with the patient mole, 
Or track the hedgehog to his hole. 
Loving and liking are the solace of life, 
Rock the cradle of joy, smooth the death-bed of strife. 
You love your father and your mother, 
Your grown-up and your baby brother; 
You love your sister and your friends, 
And countless blessings which God sends; 
And while these right affections play, 
You live each moment of your day; 
They lead you on to full content, 
And likings fresh and innocent, 
That store the mind, the memory feed, 
And prompt to many a gentle deed: 
But likings come, and pass away; 
'Tis love that remains till our latest day: 
Our heavenward guide is holy love, 
And will be our bliss with saints above. 






The ribs and terrors in the whale
 

The ribs and terrors in the whale,
   Arched over me a dismal gloom,
While all God's sun-lit waves rolled by,
   And left me deepening down to doom.

I saw the opening maw of hell,
   With endless pains and sorrows there;
Which none but they that feel can tell--
   Oh, I was plunging to despair.

In black distress, I called my God,
   When I could scarce believe him mine,
He bowed his ear to my complaints--
   No more the whale did me confine.

With speed he flew to my relief,
   As on a radiant dolphin borne;
Awful, yet bright, as lightening shone
   The face of my Deliverer God.

My song for ever shall record
   That terrible, that joyful hour;
I give the glory to my God,
   His all the mercy and the power.





Envy
 

This rose-tree is not made to bear 
The violet blue, nor lily fair, 
   Nor the sweet mignionet: 
And if this tree were discontent, 
Or wished to change its natural bent, 
   It all in vain would fret. 

And should it fret, you would suppose 
It ne'er had seen its own red rose, 
   Nor after gentle shower 
Had ever smelled its rose's scent, 
Or it could ne'er be discontent 
   With its own pretty flower. 

Like such a blind and senseless tree 
As I've imagined this to be, 
   All envious persons are: 
With care and culture all may find 
Some pretty flower in their own mind, 
   Some talent that is rare.





Misgivings
 

   When ocean-clouds over inland hills
      Sweep storming in late autumn brown,
   And horror the sodden valley fills,
      And the spire falls crashing in the town,
   I muse upon my country's ills--
   The tempest bursting from the waste of Time
On the world's fairest hope linked with man's foulest crime.

   Nature's dark side is heeded now--
      (Ah! optimist-cheer disheartened flown)--
   A child may read the moody brow
      Of yon black mountain lone.
   With shouts the torrents down the gorges go,
   And storms are formed behind the storm we feel:
The hemlock shakes in the rafter, the oak in the driving keel.





Choosing A Profession
 

A Creole boy from the West Indies brought,
To be in European learning taught,
Some years before to Westminster he went,
To a Preparatory school was sent.
When from his artless tale the mistress found
The child had not one friend on English ground,
She ev'n as if she his own mother were,
Made the dark Indian her particular care.
Oft on her favourite's future lot she thought;
To know the bent of his young mind she sought,
For much the kind preceptress wished to find
To what profession he was most inclined,
That where his genius led they might him train;
For nature's kindly bent she held not vain.
But vain her efforts to explore his will;
The frequent question he evaded still;
Till on a day at length he to her came,
Joy sparkling in his eyes; and said, the same
Trade he would be those boys of colour were,
Who danced so happy in the open air.
It was a troop of chimney-sweeping boys,
With wooden music and obstreperous noise,
In tarnish'd finery and grotesque array,
Were dancing in the streets the first of May.





The Apparition
 

(A Retrospect)
Convulsions came; and, where the field
   Long slept in pastoral green,
A goblin-mountain was upheaved
(Sure the scared sense was all deceived),
Marl-glen and slag-ravine.

The unreserve of Ill was there,
   The clinkers in her last retreat;
But, ere the eye could take it in,
Or mind could comprehension win,
   It sunk!--and at our feet.

So, then, Solidity's a crust--
   The core of fire below;
all may go well for many a year,
But who can think without a fear
   Of horrors that happen so?





Breakfast
 

A dinner party, coffee, tea, 
Sandwich, or supper, all may be 
In their way pleasant. But to me 
Not one of these deserves the praise 
That welcomer of new-born days, 
A breakfast, merits; ever giving 
Cheerful notice we are living 
Another day refreshed by sleep, 
When its festival we keep. 
Now although I would not slight 
Those kindly words we use Good night', 
Yet parting words are words of sorrow, 
And may not vie with sweet Good Morrow', 
With which again our friends we greet, 
When in the breakfast-room we meet, 
At the social table round, 
Listening to the lively sound 
Of those notes which never tire, 
Of urn, or kettle on the fire. 
Sleepy Robert never hears 
Or urn, or kettle; he appears 
When all have finished, one by one 
Dropping off, and breakfast done. 
Yet has he too his own pleasure, 
His breakfast hour's his hour of leisure; 
And, left alone, he reads or muses, 
Or else in idle mood he uses 
To sit and watch the venturous fly, 
Where the sugar's piled high, 
Clambering o'er the lumps so white, 
Rocky cliffs of sweet delight.





The Two Boys
 

I saw a boy with eager eye
Open a book upon a stall,
And read as he'd devour it all;
Which when the stall-man did espy,
Soon to the boy I heard him call,
You, Sir, you never buy a book,
Therefore in one you shall not look.'
The boy passed slowly on, and with a sigh
He wished he never had been taught to read,
Then of the old churl's books he should have had no need.

   Of sufferings the poor have many,
Which never can the rich annoy.
I soon perceived another boy
Who looked as if he'd not had any
Food for that day at least, enjoy
The sight of cold meat in a tavern larder.
This boy's case, thought I, is surely harder,
Thus hungry longing, thus without a penny,
Beholding choice of dainty dressed meat;
No wonder if he wish he ne'er had learned to eat.





Change
 

And this is what is left of youth! . . .
There were two boys, who were bred up together,
Shared the same bed, and fed at the same board;
Each tried the other's sport, from their first chase,
Young hunters of the butterfly and bee,
To when they followed the fleet hare, and tried
The swiftness of the bird. They lay beside
The silver trout stream, watching as the sun
Played on the bubbles: shared each in the store
Of either's garden: and together read
Of him, the master of the desert isle,
Till a low hut, a gun, and a canoe,
Bounded their wishes. Or if ever came
A thought of future days, 'twas but to say
That they would share each other's lot, and do
Wonders, no doubt. But this was vain: they parted
With promises of long remembrance, words
Whose kindness was the heart's, and those warm tears,
Hidden like shame by the young eyes which shed them,
But which are thought upon in after-years
As what we would give worlds to shed once more.

   They met again, -- but different from themselves,
At least what each remembered of themselves:
The one proud as a soldier of his rank,
And of his many battles: and the other
Proud of his Indian wealth, and of the skill
And toil which gathered it; each with a brow
And heart alike darkened by years and care.
They met with cold words, and yet colder looks:
Each was changed in himself, and yet each thought
The other only changed, himself the same.
And coldness bred dislike, and rivalry
Came like the pestilence o'er some sweet thoughts
That lingered yet, healthy and beautiful,
Amid dark and unkindly ones. And they,
Whose boyhood had not known one jarring word,
Were strangers in their age: if their eyes met,
'Twas but to look contempt, and when they spoke,
Their speech was wormwood! . . . 
. . . And this, this is life!






The Young
 

You bastards! It's all sherbet, and folly   
makes you laugh like mules. Chances   
dance off your wrists, each day ready,   

sprites in your bones and spite not yet   
swollen, not yet set. You gather handful   
after miracle handful, seeing straight,   

reaching the lighthouse in record time,   
pockets brim with scimitar things. Now   
is not a pinpoint but a sprawling realm.   

Bewilderment and thrill are whip-quick   
twins, carried on your backs, each vow   
new to touch and each mistake a broken   

biscuit. I was you. Sea robber boarding   
the won galleon. Roaring trees. Machines   
without levers, easy in bowel and lung.   

One cartwheel over the quicksand curve   
of Tuesday to Tuesday and you're gone,   
summering, a ship on the farthest wave.





The Beautiful
 

Into perplexity: as an itch chased round   
an oxter or early man in the cave mouth   
watching rain-drifts pour from beyond   

his understanding. Whether to admire   
the mere sensation, enough, or hold out   
for sweeter ornament, vessels of wonder   

born with that ur-charm of symmetry;   
lovely ones we ache to prize and praise,   
climb into and become because they try   

our day-by-day significance: some of us   
ugly and most of us plain, walked past   
in the drowned streets: pearls of paste,   

salted butter, secondary colors. They   
drift unapproached, gazed never-selves,   
blunt paragons of genetic industry. We   

desire them but cannot want such order.   
We stand, mouths open, and cannot help   
stammering our secrets, nailed to water.





The Damned
 

Kitten curious, or roaring down drinks   
in Soho sumps, small hours tour buses,   
satellite station green rooms, or conked   

out in the bathtubs of motorway hotels,   
there you were, with muck-about kisses,   
sharking for the snappers, before hell   

opened up for you and weeping sores   
of after fame appeared, the haphazardry   
and dwindling after three limelit years,   

recognized with catcalls, wads of spit,   
a nightclub fist, the scant camaraderie   
melts fast, like your flat on Air Street,   

the Lhasa Apso pups, the wraps and lines   
of chang, the poster pull-outs, fake tan   
smiles. It's paunch and palimony time   

on Lucifer's leash. But for a madcap few   
who cling, thin soup, one pillow Britain   
is simmering with hatred, just for you.





This Morning in a Morning Voice
 

to beat the froggiest   
of morning voices,   
   my son gets out of bed   
and takes a lumpish song   
   along--a little lyric   
learned in kindergarten,   
   something about a   
boat. He's found it in   
   the bog of his throat   
before his feet have hit   
   the ground, follows   
its wonky melody down   
   the hall and into the loo   
as if it were the most   
   natural thing for a little   
boy to do, and lets it   
   loose awhile in there   
to a tinkling sound while   
   I lie still in bed, alive   
like I've never been, in    
   love again with life,   
afraid they'll find me   
   drowned here, drowned    
in more than my fair   
   share of joy.





Were I to Wring a Rag
 

--no matter how much   
muscle I might have   
mustered--my mother   
was like to come along   
behind, reach around   
me to take it up again   
from where I'd left it,   
lift it back into my line   
of vision and in one   
practiced motion from   
that strangle in her bare   
hands and thin air work   
a second miraculous   
stream of silver dishwash   
into the day's last gleam . . .





Dont Be Flip
 

when you drop   
   your mate at   
      the dock or   

your children   
   at school. Don't   
      be cool. Don't   

be coy. Or if   
   you do, don't   
      assume it's   

okay to act   
   that way. For   
      today may   

be your last   
   chance at   
      joy before it   

flashes away   
   like a tin   
      toy in one of   

those shooting   
   galleries in   
      midways: those   

ducks that seem   
   to paddle a   
      stream that's   

not a stream   
   but a rotating   
      axle,   

toothed for   
   disappearance   
      & reappearance,   

a spit   
   without point   
      or flame,   

along which   
   randomly clucks   
      the whole game.





She had a death in me
 

She had a death in me, knees drawn up   
and my bowl and cloth rinsed through with her.   
As morning takes night, field closes the hare,   
and ay would burrow into her.   

Over the altar, catalpas rattle,   
shadow and bother the branch.   
Is this her white? Dress me.   
Her rain? Wash me with that.   
Her bowl? Feed me empty.   
Her colding? Ay am forgot.   

Then mask me the g'wen, hers skin   
being mine, and body that pools   
in the brine of her, rivers the silt and stone of her   
wrapt in the warm of hers fell.   
She were the watcher and tender of pyres   
when the wet grass shined with quiet   
and ay lean to the mouth hole: ay, mother.





A crush of oily plant and treated white
 

          
          A crush of oily plant and treated white, wrapt and reached by root, sky-touched and still, a bud in leaf: make of me a body. Oil me, hand and foot, bind me tight and scented green: this is my dressing, done. Ay lived and spoke to what ay was. No matter if you answer. On hand and foot an oil and scent. Across my forehead fingers sweep a clay. Remember what ay was and am. Kind horse, lie down beside.
        




Who kills my history
 

Who kills my history knows   
it is buried   
in the same air ay breathe.   
Only a hair is needed to keep you, mother.   
Only a fit of bone.   
Comfort, comfort, ay am my own.   

Wanting simple, a sun like water, a flow and stir of air.   
Warm stone, black-warm, dirt scent and bird.   
Ay am put out to weather.   

Animal eyed me here--heaving, breathing over--   
felt by smell for me and loomed.   
Air shifted my hair as it neared and sniffed   
then left. Comfort, comfort me.   

A thresh of sticks and vine, hand-carried   
high--ay am my own weight carried by,   
kind horse, kind mother, gone.





The Leaves Are Falling
 

Here I am saying "The leaves are falling   
--one of those choruses   
that vie with interminable verses   
to mock hoarders.   
Yeah, we get   
that a palette of winds   
is a pretty thing:   
one blurs the anther, another   
the river splurging on riprap,   
expunging   
phosphates,   
out of the temperature   
differential building   
sculptural fogs   
that promenade   
between shores a glacier   
wedged ajar, a fjord.   
Whatever gives the river   
its seriousness reverses   
in the light   
of those clouds moving   
as if absorbing   
their pomp in advance of it--   
characters   
which untied the painter   
and took the sculls again.





Year Round
 

Two flags nuzzle each other in the desultory gust   
because they are   
fleeing the trees, who are cruel to one another,   
      shading their neighbors to death   

a mixed bag   
advocating small business in a loose confederation.   

The flags don't give any shade at all.   

On the anniversary of our country   
we throw dynamite at the air   
we build into.   

*   

Daylight savings. A beeline   
to a sea lion, as the children's song extols, or is it   
a beeline to a scallion?   

You hear your own accent--   
or   
a child makes an error to see if you're listening.   

A heartfelt counterfeit.   

*   

A cough muffled   
in its own sputum's   
repeated   
in the next throat:   

a family of coughs comes   
to couch in us   
while the sun rises   
over the church,   
treetops' psych ops   
combusting all over   
the ground   
tasked   
with a snowdrop.   






Securitization
 

In someone's distant algorithm   
your mortgage was bundled to another's   
--hedged--   
and stamped a new "security.   
While it was swapped   
from investor to investor   
accruing fees and interest at each turn,   
your shadow   
partner   
defaulted   
and she abandoned her home.   

Someone uses your mortgage   
to leverage   
something   
far inside the starbursts of a server.   
Likewise marriage   
has   
no image--   
What's a mortgage   
and who's   
it engage   
on the other side of the firewall?   

*   

I witnessed a will   
which--the language invested with law   
godmothers the peacock's   
fanned   
screech--   
would take care of the baby in the event of a   
[blesses herself] 

It lives at the Cathedral   
and seems to be some kind of   
mascot for   
Baptisms   

*   

Securities:   

The future art you'll make and its pleasure   
is hedged against the   
boys who died   

you fancied.





ROYGBIV
 

The shoemaker's wife ran preschool   
With a fist made not so much of iron   
But wire bristles on a wooden brush.   

She made us recite and learn by rote.   
Our trick was to mouth words, sound   
As if we knew what we would one day   

Come to know, what would dawn   
On us as sure as a centipede knows   
What to do with its myriad legs.   

She made us settle our feet on the mud   
Floor of her daub and wattle hut and she   
Wielded a cane cut from wood that bit   

Into the palm of the hand and left a burn   
That resonated up the arm for an age   
After its smart swing and crisp contact.   

Worst of all was the shoe cupboard   
Where the old man stored his wire   
Brushes: a cold, dark, narrow place,   

Replete with brushes hung on nails   
Covering every square inch and said   
To come alive when a child was locked   

In with them so that they scrubbed   
Flesh off that child's bones. She said   
We would end up there if we did not   

Concentrate, so we stilled our feet   
And spoke the words in the right order   
For colors in a rainbow until the very 

Thing took her place in front of us   
Arranged in cuneiform, polished,   
Brandishing a window to climb out.





Railway
 

Long before you see train   
The tracks sing and tremble,   
Long before you know direction   
Train come from, a hum   
Announces it soon arrive.   
So we tend to drop on all fours   
Even before we look left or right.   
We skip the sleepers or walk   
Along by balancing on a rail.   
We talk about the capital   
Where the train ends its run   
From the interior stacked with   
The outsized trunks of felled   
Trees and open-topped cars of bauxite.   
We always hide from it unsure   
What the train will do if we   
Stand next to the tracks.   
It flattens our nails into knives,   
It obliterates any traffic   
Caught by it at crossroads,   
It whistles a battle cry,   
Steam from the engine a mood   
Not to mess with or else.   
Rails without beginning or end,   
Twinned hopes always at your back,   
Always up front signaling you on,   
Double oxen, hoof stomp, temper   
Tantrum, stampede, clatter   
Matter, head splitter, hear us,   
Stooped with an ear to the line--    
greenheart, mora, baromalli,   
purple heart, crabwood,   
kabakalli, womara.





Gods Secretary
 

Her e-mail inbox always overflows.   
Her outbox doesn't get much use at all.   
She puts on hold the umpteen-billionth call   
As music oozes forth to placate those   
Who wait, then disconnect. Outside, wind blows,   
Scything pale leaves. She sees a sparrow fall   
Fluttering to a claw-catch on a wall.   
Will He be in today? God only knows.   

She hasn't seen His face--He's so aloof.   
She's long resigned He'll never know or love her   
But still can wish there were some call, some proof   
That He requires a greater service of her.   
Fingers of rain now drum upon the roof,   
Coming from somewhere, somewhere far above her.   





Therapy  from the Garden
 

Panic attacks your pain-porous skin?   
Imagine the layers of onion, Sufi-circling   
and circling until there is no tear-making body.   
If the issue is anorexia, taking starvation's   
dark spirit-flight, or anhedonia, running from   
the skin's having fun, consider the mushroom's   
fleshy erection, and the pumpkins, earth goddesses   
and rotund Buddhas sprawled by compost's funky aerosol.   
For social phobia, desensitize among the rows   
of corn's parade, ticker tape leaves and Rasta tassels   
that wind-strut and bring on the crows' hop and rap.   
Too much affect: meditate on potatoes, taciturn   
as overturned stones. Too little: visualize the hanging   
tomatoes' insides, the soft hearts, sentimental ornaments.   
From the lettuce there is common sense for narcissism:   
acceptance as side dish, garnish for a meaty sandwich.   
If that leaf isn't the dose, there's always the soil   
people shovel and level, rake and make wishful with seed,   
feed leftovers from the compost's vegan sewer,   
the soil that wants for nothing and yields and yields.





Prairie Octopus, Awake
 

The night's turned everything to junipers   
shagged & spooked with cerulean chalk-fruit,   
weird berries whiffing of Martians in rut.   
I forget this isn't my universe   
sometimes. Sometimes I think I was falling   
most of my life to land here, a lone skirl   
in the immaculate hush. In my world   
I waltzed with my ink-self, my black shantung.   

Owls swallow vowels in stilled trees. It's not   
sleeplessness, it's fear of what the dark will   
do if I don't keep a close eye on it.   
Blue minutes leak from the pricked stars' prisms,   
seep into the earth unchecked. Just as well--   
I've hardly enough arms to gather them.





Ad Hominem
 

The Poet: 

         Fugitive lung, prodigal intestine--   
         where's the pink crimp in my side   
         where they took you out? 


The Octopus: 

         It must be a dull world, indeed,   
         where everything appears   
         to be a version or extrapolation   
         of you.   

         The birds are you.   
         The springtime is you.   
         Snails, hurricanes, saddles, elevators--   
         everything becomes   
         you.   

         I, with a shift   
         of my skin, divest my self   
         to become the rock   
         that shadows it.   

         Think of when   
         your reading eyes momentarily drift,   
         and in that instant   

         you see the maddening swarm of alien ciphers submerged within the text   
         gone before you can focus.   
         That's me.   
          
         Or your dozing revelation   
         on the subway that you are   
         slowly being   
         digested. Me again.   

         I am the fever dream   
         in which you see your loved ones   
         as executioners. I am also their axe.   

         Friend, while you're exhausting   
         the end of a day   
         with your sad approximations,   

         I'm a mile deep   
         in the earth, vamping   
         my most flawless impression   
         of the abyss   
         to the wild applause of eels.





Plasma
 

About the radiant heart   
of the matter, valencies   
drift 
      Hagar and Ishmael, cast   
         on the wide desert,   
drift, and a placeless voice   
draws them to water   
                              St. Elmo,   
eyes scorched, preaches them   
to the lightning touching down   
close, blackening the deck   
around him, disclosing tars   
          transfixed in the rigging--   
all the yard-arms were tipped   
with a pallid fire, writes Melville,   
            lamplit, landlocked   
            at Arrowhead Farm   
            and in the wilderness the boy   
became an archer 
                        I read   
again, then wandered the house,   
turning off the fluorescents   
and the news on the flat screen--   
raw sun on the saltwater and ice,   
a tank tread sprawled in the sand   
like a snarled length of spine--   
            and went out to listen   
to the cloud fields foredarkened   
with charge and ask again   
         into that synapse   
by what light will I see   
as even now I am seen?





Lives of the Watchmakers
 

Surely there are teeth so small.   
I have listened for their turning,   
this frail swell and fall   

like old blood yearning   
upwards through the skin of days.   
Slowly, I am learning   

their count, though numbers fray   
in me, and the loaded instants   
graft, coming always   

to the same tangle: the distant   
cry merging with the song   
at hand, the rain's insistent   

opening in daylong   
dryness, the plain moon   
draining into dawn.   

And below it all, hewn   
from the pliant light of some   
Geneva noon,   

they spin time's thrum.   
Stopped, I have bent my ears   
to them. I have become   

sound inside their years.   
Surely I have known the whole   
of grief and grace in gears.   






The Mare of Money
 

Another dead mare waits   
in the shoals of some body   
of water, waits to be burden,   
borne into a foaming ocean,   
where it might become food   
for whales, or, simply empty   
signifier--hair latched to the sea's undulation   
like Absalom's beauty   
caught in the playful branches   
of a tree desiring union,   
entanglement, thick confusion--   
but not this mare;   
she does not get the luxury   
of a lyric--a song that makes our own undoing   
or killing sweet even as we go down   
into the fire to rise as smoke.   
This horse must lie, eyes open,   
amongst the stones and fresh water   
crawfish in Money, Mississippi,   
listen to the men's boots break the water   
as they drop a black boy's body near her head,   
pick him up, only to let him fall again   
there: bent and eye-to-eye with her   
as though decaying is something   
that requires a witness   
--as though the mare might say:   
on Tuesday after the rain fell,   
the boy's neck finally snapped   
from the weight of the mill fan;   
he never looked at me again. 
Or the boy might say:   
No more. They part   
here--the boy's body found   
in another man's arms, carried back   
to town, as the horse says nothing 
because horses don't speak, besides   
this one's dead.





Cymothoa Exigua
 

cymothoa exigua*: the tongue as what it is not--blemish   
and parasite: gimp and glottal stop: what question can be   
answered with a truant mouth: can the lynched man hung   
from the sails of a windmill taste the lead pipe wedged   
between his lips: when the signifiers dangle, empty chum   
lines in a cold creek: when the men in Waco, wearing white   
straw hats, fraying at the crisp edges of their white shirts,   
leave Jesse, leave John, leave Paul in ashes in the unpaved   
streets to choke passing mules into prophecy: when we pinch   
our noses to staunch the smell of the twice burnt black man   
burning for a third time this day: when the boys, sweet   
and good animals, come to what's been left in shallow ditches:   
false rib and femur, clavicle and severed hand--quite simply,   
the language of sorrow: glyph of the gadfly rooting himself   
into the rotting meat of the dead: when it is too late   
to refuse our bodies being made urns: corn, unharvested   
and heavy in its husks: when, in the marketplace, the butcher lifts   
our tongue from a bed of ice, shouts: who will speak for this flesh:   
when the tongue answers as all severed tongues do:   






Cosmogony
 

A yarn ball and a hill   
maintain an equipoise until   
         their neatness starts to bore the gods   
                   of potential and energy   
         who hedge bets, reckoning the odds   
                   of when the rest will be   

set in motion, and who,   
first stumbling upon this clew,   
          constructed both the incline and   
                   the inclination to unwind.   
          Like most gods, though, they haven't planned   
                   to stay; they mastermind   

the scheme, ex nihilio,   
then slip behind the shadow show   
          and designate an agent, chief   
                   remaker of their mischief made.   
          Each time, disguised, this leitmotif   
                   gets salvaged and replayed,   

a universe begins,   
for orogens and origins   
          suppose a Way Things Were before   
                   some volatile, untimely That--   
          sweetness perverted by the core   
                   or belfry by the bat,   

or here, a hilly green,   
whose still life, eerily serene,   
          completes their best contrivance yet:   
                   from high above, a williwaw,   
          a hiss, and then the silhouette   
                   of one terrific paw. 






Lares and Penates
 

The suburbs? Well, for heaven's sake   
who wouldn't choose the absolute   
convenience? Cheap, a quick commute,   
and close to Lowe's, a Steak 'n Shake,   
our own police and DMV,   
          a library, a lake.   
                     
Esteemed domestic diplomats,   
we trump conundrums (His and Hers)   
and smother any fuss that stirs   
the air of habit habitats.   
It's not an easy job; in short,   
          we wear a lot of hats.   

And so, we're grateful, from the street   
you'd miss the issues we're ignoring:   
termites and week-old dishes mooring,   
barnacled with shredded wheat,   
the bunch of brown bananas stuck   
          with a yellow Post-it: Eat! 

We dictate chores, but understand   
the clock moves faster than we do   
and focus on those old and blue   
dilemmas of the second hand:   
inheritance, ill-fitting pants,   
          smoke, rumors, foreclosed land.   

Winters, we help keep track of taxes,   
sort copies Xerox-hot in piles,   
or prune unruly hanging files   
(a fixture of our weekend praxis).   
There's always something. In this house,   
          only the cat relaxes-- 

because the clutter drives a need   
for more, more room, more hours, food,   
more use of the subjunctive mood . . .    
tomorrow, yes, we must succeed   
in keeping peace and making time   
          to garden, and to read.   

Still, every spring our porches spawn   
insects we can't identify   
and ferns turned freeze-dried octopi.   
They spill into the arid lawn   
with diasporic fliers, clover   
          and choirs of woebegone   

house sparrows whose incessant cheeping   
recalls the gloomy Ubi sunt,   
our soundtrack to the nightly hunt   
for whatever is downstairs, beeping.   
(As if the sleepless wanted some   
          reminder they're not sleeping.)   

But don't fret; clarity, if brief,   
is possible. The best folks see   
an artfulness in entropy--   
the rust, the dust, the bas-relief   
of Aquafresh-encrusted sinks.    
          So when, in disbelief,   
                     
a lady skims new catalogs,   
convinced her luster's fading, faded,   
and, afraid to end up jaded,   
doughy in orthotic clogs,   
she gracefully accepts her fate   
          and rises early. Jogs.





School
 

All winter we sat blind, I next to the girl   
who loved her scabs, the blood shields   
her head gave up, her face a sun of blank   
amazement. She drew. This means love:   
a circle with a line through it. More work:   
a cross. More crosses. Ice sloughed   
through fields. Ice river, the pages   
of our notebooks. Outside: limbs and roads   
and wires. Outside cracked with force   
and turning. Our poems filled with salt.   
He took me to his bed.   
The writer never speaks. The writer speaks   
in details, the sateen lining of my coat,   
the star point of tongue kissing. The winter   
speaks in the whip. Runoff nixed   
with ash. I spilt water on my notebook.   
Words went back to ink; paper back   
to ruffle, pulp. You smell like dog, the girl   
said. You will be left like the winter.   
Little sputter in the car's craw. Little   
crevice in the pavement. Ice reminder.   
He took me to his bed, saying: Ali,   
Ali, tell no one. I told the girl, a sore   
gathering, another skin to pick and worry.





After the Party
 

Sugar dries on paper plates. The cake's   
decimated and barely touched. What to do   
with the balloons? A few float listlessly,   
unattached, still bearing like bandages   
the tape that bore them to the wall.   
They've gone dull, rubber tips darkening   
to a bottle's pinch. It's too late, or too early.   
There are too many on the floor, stirred up   
as I stir. In the end, I cut them, urge a blade   
into the inch between knot and blossom.   
Slow deflation. It reveals what they are:   
sacs of plastic, stale with air. I've seen this   
before, in the newspaper picture of Nefertiti,   
bound in the antechamber of a tomb,   
cast out of favor, her body, barely wrapped.   
How they know her: by the queenly jaw,   
age of limbs and teeth. Also, by the broken   
mouth, smashed by priests so she cannot   
eat, cannot breathe in the afterlife.





Nights of 19641966: The Old Reliable
 

for Lewis Ellingham   The laughing soldiers fought to their defeat . . .  James Fenton, "In a Notebook
White decorators interested in Art, 
Black file clerks with theatrical ambitions, 
kids making pharmaceutical revisions 
in journals Comp. instructors urged they start, 
the part-Cherokee teenage genius (maybe), 
the secretary who hung out with fairies, 
the copywriter wanting to know, where is 
my husband? the soprano with the baby, 
all drank draft beer or lethal sweet Manhattans 
or improvised concoctions with tequila 
in summer when, from Third Street, we could feel a   
night breeze waft in whose fragrances were Latin. 
The place was run by Polish refugees: 
squat Margie, gaunt Speedy (whose sobriquet 
transliterated what?). He'd brought his play 
from d. After a while, we guessed Margie's 
illiteracy was why he cashed checks 
and she perched near the threshold to ban pros, 
the underage, the fugitive, and those 
arrayed impertinently to their sex. 
The bar was talk and cruising; in the back 
room, we danced: Martha and the Vandellas, 
Smokey and the Miracles, while sellers 
and buyers changed crisp tens for smoke and smack. 
Some came in after work, some after supper, 
plumage replenished to meet who knew who. 
Behind the bar, Margie dished up beef stew. 
On weeknights, you could always find an upper 
to speed you to your desk, and drink till four. 
Loosened by booze, we drifted, on the ripples 
of Motown, home in new couples, or triples, 
were back at dusk, with IDs, at the door. 
Bill was my roommate, Russell drank with me, 
although they were a dozen years my seniors. 
I walked off with the eighteen-year-old genius 
--an Older Woman, barely twenty-three. 
Link was new as Rimbaud, and better looking, 
North Beach bar paideon of doomed Jack Spicer, 
like Russell, our two-meter artificer, 
a Corvo whose ecclesia was cooking. 
Bill and Russell were painters. Bill had been 
a monk in Kyoto. Stoned, we sketched together, 
till he discovered poppers and black leather 
and Zen consented to new discipline. 
We shared my Sixth Street flat with a morose 
cat, an arch cat, and pot plants we pruned daily. 
His boyfriend had left him for an Israeli 
dancer; my husband was on Mykonos. 
Russell loved Harold, who was Black and bad, 
and lavished on him dinners "meant for men 
like Escoffier and Brillat-Savarin. 
Staunch blond Dora made rice. When she had 
tucked in the twins, six flights of tenement 
stairs they'd descend, elevenish, and stroll 
down Third Street, desultory night patrol 
gone mauve and green under the virulent   
streetlights, to the bar, where Bill and I 
(if we'd not come to dinner), Link, and Lew, 
and Betty had already had a few. 
One sweat-soaked night in pitiless July, 
wedged on booth benches of cracked Naugahyde, 
we planned a literary magazine 
where North Beach met the Lower East Side Scene. 
We could have titled it When Worlds Collide. 
Dora was gone, "In case the children wake up. 
Link lightly had decamped with someone else 
(the German engineer? Or was he Bill's?). 
Russell's stooped vale brushed my absent makeup. 
Armed children spared us home, our good-night hugs 
laissez-passer. We railed against the war. 
Soon, some of us bused south with SNCC and CORE. 
Soon, some of us got busted dealing drugs. 
The file clerks took exams and forged ahead. 
The decorators' kitchens blazed persimmon. 
The secretary started kissing women, 
and so did I, and my three friends are dead.





Christmas Night
 

Let midnight gather up the wind   
and the cry of tires on bitter snow.   
Let midnight call the cold dogs home,   
sleet in their fur--last one can blow   

the streetlights out.   If children sleep   
after the day's unfoldings, the wheel   
of gifts and griefs, may their breathing   
ease the strange hollowness we feel.   

Let midnight draw whoever's left   
to the grate where a burnt-out log unrolls   
low mutterings of smoke until   
a small fire wakes in its crib of coals.





To Solitude
 

I am weary of the working, 
   Weary of the long day's heat; 
To thy comfortable bosom, 
   Wilt thou take me, spirit sweet? 

Weary of the long, blind struggle 
   For a pathway bright and high,-- 
Weary of the dimly dying 
   Hopes that never quite all die. 

Weary searching a bad cipher 
   For a good that must be meant; 
Discontent with being weary,-- 
   Weary with my discontent. 

I am weary of the trusting 
   Where my trusts but torments prove; 
Wilt thou keep faith with me? wilt thou 
   Be my true and tender love? 

I am weary drifting, driving 
   Like a helmless bark at sea; 
Kindly, comfortable spirit, 
   Wilt thou give thyself to me? 

Give thy birds to sing me sonnets? 
   Give thy winds my cheeks to kiss? 
And thy mossy rocks to stand for 
   The memorials of our bliss? 

I in reverence will hold thee, 
   Never vexed with jealous ills, 
Though thy wild and wimpling waters 
   Wind about a thousand hills.





Autumn
 

Shorter and shorter now the twilight clips 
   The days, as though the sunset gates they crowd, 
And Summer from her golden collar slips 
   And strays through stubble-fields, and moans aloud, 

Save when by fits the warmer air deceives, 
   And, stealing hopeful to some sheltered bower, 
She lies on pillows of the yellow leaves, 
   And tries the old tunes over for an hour. 

The wind, whose tender whisper in the May 
   Set all the young blooms listening through th' grove, 
Sits rustling in the faded boughs to-day 
   And makes his cold and unsuccessful love. 

The rose has taken off her tire of red-- 
   The mullein-stalk its yellow stars have lost, 
And the proud meadow-pink hangs down her head 
   Against earth's chilly bosom, witched with frost. 

The robin, that was busy all the June, 
   Before the sun had kissed the topmost bough, 
Catching our hearts up in his golden tune, 
   Has given place to the brown cricket now. 

The very cock crows lonesomely at morn-- 
   Each flag and fern the shrinking stream divides-- 
Uneasy cattle low, and lambs forlorn 
   Creep to their strawy sheds with nettled sides. 

Shut up the door: who loves me must not look 
   Upon the withered world, but haste to bring 
His lighted candle, and his story-book, 
   And live with me the poetry of Spring.





The Slave Mother
 

Heard you that shriek? It rose 
   So wildly on the air, 
It seem'd as if a burden'd heart 
   Was breaking in despair. 

Saw you those hands so sadly clasped-- 
   The bowed and feeble head-- 
The shuddering of that fragile form-- 
   That look of grief and dread? 

Saw you the sad, imploring eye? 
   Its every glance was pain, 
As if a storm of agony 
   Were sweeping through the brain. 

She is a mother pale with fear, 
   Her boy clings to her side, 
And in her kyrtle vainly tries 
   His trembling form to hide. 

He is not hers, although she bore 
   For him a mother's pains; 
He is not hers, although her blood 
   Is coursing through his veins! 

He is not hers, for cruel hands 
   May rudely tear apart 
The only wreath of household love 
   That binds her breaking heart. 

His love has been a joyous light 
   That o'er her pathway smiled, 
A fountain gushing ever new, 
   Amid life's desert wild. 

His lightest word has been a tone 
   Of music round her heart, 
Their lives a streamlet blent in one-- 
   Oh, Father! must they part?

They tear him from her circling arms,
   Her last and fond embrace.
Oh! never more may her sad eyes
   Gaze on his mournful face.

No marvel, then, these bitter shrieks
   Disturb the listening air:
She is a mother, and her heart
   Is breaking in despair.





 Bible Defense of Slavery
 

Take sackcloth of the darkest dye,
   And shroud the pulpits round!
Servants of Him that cannot lie,
   Sit mourning on the ground.

Let holy horror blanch each cheek,
   Pale every brow with fears;
And rocks and stones, if ye could speak,
   Ye well might melt to tears!

Let sorrow breathe in every tone,
   In every strain ye raise;
Insult not God's majestic throne
   With th' mockery of praise.

A reverend man, whose light should be
   The guide of age and youth,
Brings to the shrine of Slavery
   The sacrifice of truth!

For the direst wrong by man imposed,
   Since Sodom's fearful cry,
The word of life has been unclos'd,
   To give your God the lie.

Oh! When ye pray for heathen lands,
   And plead for their dark shores,
Remember Slavery's cruel hands
   Make heathens at your doors!





 Lines
 

At the Portals of the Future,
    Full of madness, guilt and gloom,
Stood the hateful form of Slavery,
    Crying, Give, Oh! give me room

Room to smite the earth with cursing,
    Room to scatter, rend and slay,
From the trembling mother's bosom
    Room to tear her child away;

Room to trample on the manhood
    Of the country far and wide;
Room to spread o'er every Eden
    Slavery's scorching lava-tide.

Pale and trembling stood the Future,
    Quailing neath his frown of hate,
As he grasped with bloody clutches
    The great keys of Doom and Fate.

In his hand he held a banner
    All festooned with blood and tears:
Twas a fearful ensign, woven
    With the grief and wrong of years.

On his brow he wore a helmet
    Decked with strange and cruel art;
Every jewel was a life-drop
    Wrung from some poor broken heart.

Though her cheek was pale and anxious,
    Yet, with look and brow sublime,
By the pale and trembling Future
    Stood the Crisis of our time.

And from many a throbbing bosom
    Came the words in fear and gloom,
Tell us, Oh! thou coming Crisis,
    What shall be our country's dooma?

Shall the wings of dark destruction
    Brood and hover o'er our land,
Till we trace the steps of ruin
    By their blight, from strand to strand?





the rites for Cousin Vit
 

Carried her unprotesting out the door. 
Kicked back the casket-stand. But it can't hold her, 
That stuff and satin aiming to enfold her, 
The lid's contrition nor the bolts before. 
Oh oh. Too much. Too much. Even now, surmise, 
She rises in the sunshine. There she goes, 
Back to the bars she knew and the repose 
In love-rooms and the things in people's eyes. 
Too vital and too squeaking. Must emerge. 
Even now she does the snake-hips with a hiss, 
Slops the bad wine across her shantung, talks 
Of pregnancy, guitars and bridgework, walks 
In parks or alleys, comes haply on the verge 
Of happiness, haply hysterics. Is.





Wait
 

Chop, hack, slash; chop, hack, slash; cleaver, boning knife, ax-- 
not even the clumsiest clod of a butcher could do this so crudely,   
time, as do you, dismember me, render me, leave me slop in a pail, 
one part of my body a hundred years old, one not even there anymore,   
another still riven with idiot vigor, voracious as the youth I was   
for whom everything always was going too slowly, too slowly. 

It was me then who chopped, slashed, through you, across you,   
relished you, gorged on you, slugged your invisible liquor down raw. 
Now you're polluted; pulse, clock, calendar taint you, befoul you, 
you suck at me, pull at me, barbed wire knots of memory tear me,   
my heart hangs, inert, a tag-end of tissue, firing, misfiring,   
trying to heave itself back to its other way with you. 

But was there ever really any other way with you? When I ran 
as though for my life, wasn't I fleeing from you, or for you? 
Wasn't I frightened you'd fray, leave me nothing but shreds? 
Aren't I still? When I snatch at one of your moments, and clutch it, 
a pebble, a planet, isn't it wearing away in my hand as though I,   
not you, were the ocean of acid, the corrosive in I which dissolve? 

Wait, though, wait: I should tell you too how happy I am, 
how I love it so much, all of it, chopping and slashing and all. 
Please know I love especially you, how every morning you turn over 
the languorous earth, for how would she know otherwise to do dawn, 
to do dusk, when all she hears from her speech-creatures is "Wait!"?   
We whose anguished wish is that our last word not be "Wait."





Zebra
 

Kids once carried tin soldiers in their pockets as charms   
against being afraid, but how trust soldiers these days   
not to load up, aim, blast the pants off your legs? 

I have a key-chain zebra I bought at the Thanksgiving fair. 
How do I know she won't kick, or bite at my crotch? 
Because she's been murdered, machine-gunned: she's dead. 

Also, she's a she: even so crudely carved, you can tell   
by the sway of her belly a foal's inside her. 
Even murdered mothers don't hurt people, do they?   

And how know she's murdered? Isn't everything murdered? 
Some dictator's thugs, some rebels, some poachers; 
some drought, world-drought, world-rot, pollution, extinction. 

Everything's murdered, but still, not good, a dead thing   
in with your ID and change. I fling her away, but the death   
of her clings, the death of her death, her murder, her slaughter. 

The best part of Thanksgiving Day, though--the parade! 
Mickey Mouse, Snoopy, Kermit the Frog, enormous as clouds! 
And the marching bands, majorettes, anthems and drums! 

When the great bass stomped its galloping boom out 
to the crowd, my heart swelled with valor and pride. 
I remembered when we saluted, when we took off our hat.





I Hate
 

I hate how this unsummoned sigh-sound, sob-sound, 
not sound really, feeling, sigh-feeling, sob-feeling, 
keeps rising in me, rasping in me, not in its old disguise 
as nostalgia, sweet crazed call of the blackbird; 

not as remembrance, grief for so many gone, 
nor either that other tangle of recall, regret   
for unredeemed wrongs, errors, omissions, 
petrified roots too deep to ever excise; 

a mingling rather, a melding, inextricable mesh   
of delight in astonishing being, of being in being, 
with a fear of and fear for I can barely think what, 
not non-existence, of self, loved ones, love; 

not even war, fuck war, sighing for war, 
sobbing for war, for no war, peace, surcease; 
more than all that, some ground-sound, ground-note,   
sown in us now, that swells in us, all of us,   

echo of love we had, have, for world, for our world, 
on which we seem finally mere swarm, mere deluge, 
mere matter self-altered to tumult, to noise, 
cacophonous blitz of destruction, despoilment, 

din from which every emotion henceforth emerges, 
and into which falters, slides, sinks, and subsides: 
sigh-sound of lament, of remorse; sob-sound of rue,   
of, still, always, ever sadder and sadder sad joy.





The First Line is the Deepest
 

I have been one acquainted with the spatula, 
the slotted, scuffed, Teflon-coated spatula 

that lifts a solitary hamburger from pan to plate, 
acquainted with the vibrator known as the Pocket Rocket 

and the dildo that goes by Tex,   
and I have gone out, a drunken bitch, 

in order to ruin   
what love I was given,   

and also I have measured out   
my life in little pills--Zoloft, 

Restoril, Celexa,   
Xanax.   

I have. For I am a poet. And it is my job, my duty 
to know wherein lies the beauty 

of this degraded body, 
or maybe   

it's the degradation in the beautiful body,   
the ugly me 

groping back to my desk to piss 
on perfection, to lay my kiss 

of mortal confusion   
upon the mouth of infinite wisdom. 

My kiss says razors and pain, my kiss says   
America is charged with the madness   

of God. Sundays, too, 
the soldiers get up early, and put on their fatigues in the blue- 

black day. Black milk. Black gold. Texas tea. 
Into the valley of Halliburton rides the infantry-- 

Why does one month have to be the cruelest, 
can't they all be equally cruel? I have seen the best 

gamers of your generation, joysticking their M1 tanks through 
the sewage-filled streets. Whose 

world this is I think I know.





Names
 

If the sea is a cathedral, a tide pool 
is a chapel. Sculpins dart under the wind 
that blusters their cupped oceans. 
Sculpted by wave on rock, their pockets of salt 
grow thin from the rain, the suffocating 
fresh water. Sculpin and hermit crab and limpet 
endure the sea's absence, the lost comfort 
of constant temperature, while the unconceived 
sky drums the roof over their pooled world 
with litanies of unbreathable torrent. 

Christ, I have no praise for you. 
Beyond saying a vodka-wrecked troller 
and shacks the color of the desire to die, beyond 
saying predatory snails that glide on their bellies 
like the penitent, flexing their borers, 
beyond saying seraphim that bicker exactly like gulls, 
the shells that are my ears 
sing no psalms except I can name 
many small creatures in the world of a tide pool. 
Christ, have mercy on all things that drown in air, 
I have no praise for you. I say the tide: 
Tide! 
Tide! 
Tide! 
I say: Ebb! 
Flood! 
Ebb! 
Flood! 
I always start with "Ebb!" 
I always end with "Flood!" 






"Names" is from a sequence titled "Hard Weather Prayers."





Requiem
 

The angels I love 
bicker over cod guts and snapper spines. 
They joust for flounder skulls and pick the bones clean, 
screaming. Their harsh, fine voices 
break across my town 
in a language lost to my kind, 
thoughtless in the clear now of now 
without death. Christ, walk down streets paved 
with rain to me and you drown in my choir, 
my angels beating prayer under wing 
which is the want I have not loved 
well. Where did my weather go? Meet me 
where my hidden weather went, 
where praise and rain 
are never spent. 







"Requiem" is from a sequence titled "Hard Weather Prayers."





Hard Work
 

Tricky work sometimes not to smell yourself, 
ferment being constant--constant as carnival sweat 
(a non-stock phrase I palmed from a girl from Canada, 
a land where I once saw this graffiti: life is great). 

And I have tasted myself, especially when I spilled 
sinigang all down my arm in a Pinoy workers' caff 
in Little Manila. I drank sinigang (is soup drunk?) 
in Big Manila too, with all its dead skyscrapers. 

Seen myself? In looking glasses or, looking down, 
stocky as a shift working cop, maybe a Mexican cop 
full of beans (frijoles, I mean, not vim), paunch full 
of sopa de vigilia, pulling over a sozzled bus driver. 

Heard myself speak fluently in my own language, 
have heard myself too described as hard work 
(as hard to get through as Scotch broth), though once 
someone rather bladdered told me I was magnetic. 

And I may as well admit that I have touched myself 
(who hasn't?). In a forest, on a train, in New York 
and Paris with unparalleled handiwork, sinning   
as I go, merry as an office boy spooning onion soup.





Season of Quite
 

With refreshments and some modesty and home-drawn maps, 
the ladies of the parish are marshaling the plans in hand, 
devising the occasions, in softest pencil: the Day of Hearsay, 
Leeway Week, the Maybe Pageant, a hustings on the word   
nearby. Half-promised rain roosts in some clouds a mile out, 
gradual weather making gradual notes on the green, the well, 
the monument, the mayor's yard where dogs purr on elastic. 

Everything taken by the smooth handle then, or about to be, 
hiatus sharp in humble fashion. A small boy spins one wheel 
of an upturned bike, the pond rises, full of skimmed stones 
on somehow days, not Spring, not Summer yet. Engagements 
are announced in the Chronicle, a nine-yard putt falls short. 
Dark cattle amble on the angles of Flat Field. The ladies close 
their plotting books and fill pink teacups, there or thereabouts.





Earth Science
 

I smell me   
coming up behind me 
some days-- 
sweet sarcophagal 

history. The Ark 
after the beasts   
disembarked, 
the motel bed 

as the maid draws 
the shades, shakes the sheets, 
blinks back the stink, 
the leafed hollow 

where the stalled mower   
sits in its exhaust   
and smells of wronged 
flesh, wing, meat   

but me mostly, 
climbing the steps, 
extract of me, 
stinking of me.





Eremite
 

--Katounakia, 2007
The cave itself is pleasantly austere, 
                     with little clutter--nothing save   
a narrow slab, a threadbare woolen wrap,   
                      and in the chipped-out recess here   
three sooty icons lit by oil lamp.   
                      Just beyond the dim cave's aperture, 
a blackened kettle rests among the coals, 
                      whereby, each afternoon, a grip   
of wild greens is boiled to a tender mess. 
                      The eremite lies prostrate near 
two books--a gospel and the Syrian's 
                      collected prose--whose pages turn 
assisted by a breeze. Besides the thread 
                      of wood smoke rising from the coals, 
no other motion takes the eye. The old   
                      man's face is pressed into the earth, 
his body stretched as if to reach ahead. 
                      The pot boils dry. He feeds on what 
we do not see, and may be satisfied.





Idiot Psalms
 

1   

       A psalm of Isaak, accompanied by Jew's harp. 

O God Belovd if obliquely so, 
                     dimly apprehended in the midst 
                     of this, the fraught obscuring fog   
                     of my insufficiently capacious ken,   
                     Ostensible Lover of our kind--while 
                     apparently aloof--allow 
                     that I might glimpse once more 
                     Your shadow in the land, avail 
                     for me, a second time, the sense 
                     of dire Presence in the pulsing 
                     hollow near the heart.   
Once more, O Lord, from Your enormity incline 
                     your Face to shine upon Your servant, shy 
                     of immolation, if You will. 


                                     2   

       A psalm of Isaak, accompanied by baying hounds. 

O Shaper of varicolored clay and cellulose, O Keeper 
                     of same, O Subtle Tweaker, Agent 
                     of energies both appalling and unobserved,   
                     do not allow Your servant's limbs to stiffen 
                     or to ossify unduly, do not compel Your servant   
                     to go brittle, neither cramping at the heart,   
                     nor narrowing his affective sympathies 
                     neither of the flesh nor of the alleged soul. 
Keep me sufficiently limber that I might continue 
                     to enjoy my morning run among the lilies   
                     and the rowdy waterfowl, that I might 
                     delight in this and every evening's intercourse   
                     with the woman you have set beside me. 
Make me to awaken daily with a willingness 
                     to roll out readily, accompanied 
                     by grateful smirk, a giddy joy,   
                     the idiot's undying expectation,   
                     despite the evidence. 


                                     3 

       A psalm of Isaak, whispered mid the Philistines, beneath the breath. 

Master both invisible and notoriously   
                     slow to act, should You incline to fix   
                     Your generous attentions for the moment 
                     to the narrow scene of this our appointed 
                     tedium, should You--once our kindly 
                     secretary has duly noted which of us 
                     is feigning presence, and which excused, which unexcused, 
                     You may be entertained to hear how much we find to say 
                     about so little. Among these other mediocrities, 
                     Your mediocre servant gets a glimpse of how 
                     his slow and meager worship might appear 
                     from where You endlessly attend our dreariness. 
Holy One, forgive, forgo and, if You will, fend off   
                     from this my heart the sense that I am drowning here   
                     amid the motions, the discussions, the several 
                     questions endlessly recast, our paper ballots. 


                                     4   

       Isaak's penitential psalm, unaccompanied. 

Again, and yes again, O Ceaseless Tolerator 
                     of our bleaking recurrences, O Forever Forgoing   
                     Foregone (sans conclusion), O Inexhaustible, 
                     I find my face against the floor, and yet again 
                     my plea escapes from unclean lips, and from a heart 
                     caked in and constricted by its own soiled residue. 
You are forever, and forever blessed, and I aspire 
                     one day to slip my knot and change things up, 
                     to manage at least one late season sinlessly, 
                     to bow before you yet one time without chagrin.





Stray Dogs in Fall
 

The small white mutt of my 
Unsure Self trails the masterless 
Dog of the Dying World, 
                        watching him 
lope the endless block 
of yards he knew before his 
birth . . . I imitate his muffled bark 
& snuffling breath, as round   
& round 
               we trot as one 
through rustling browns 
of the dying world. 

               For it's come to me 
now that a dog sniffing round 
for the perfect smell, & a place 
to pee 
            in the chilly breeze,   
is the Rudiment of Life. 

And, if so, 
            the Poetry of Fall 
is the dog of myself, untied 
at last, from the Rope 
of the World 
               dreaming 
he'll one day snuffle past   
those crackling heaps   
            of burning 
leaves, becalmed by the scent 
of smoky light, 
Alone.





Feather in Bas-Relief
 

Words without much use 
now. Unable to remake 
the thing. And I thought 

what should I think-- 
followed by: spring light looks 
like feathers. (Birds 

seemed conveniently 
decorous.) What then 
does this leave I asked 

& was surprised to know 
so quickly--that my understanding 
of what the light & birds 

could not be made to mean 
would not detract 
from them as they 

were. Bound by feathers 
(a thought, I will admit, 
born of artifice alone) 

they bore themselves aloft. 
What could I counter with? 
I, who held my heart 

in offering as much for 
show as for a fear so deep 
I found I couldn't name it.





La Petite Vie
 

Love is the kindest 
expression 
of absence-- 

Or else 
is a day 
by the river, 

in which by 
motion 
it becomes clear-- 

there have been 
in an hour an 
infinite train 

of rivers, & which 
did you want 
to see? One 

comes slowly 
to realize 
there is no evading things 

(the heart will have 
its way, though 
its will go 

unfulfilled), 
& there is no shame 
in this. 

The pleasures in this world-- 
soft breeze, soft 
thighs, a bit of music, 

words that make 
a good sound-- 
suggest when taken 

whole that the 
thing 
the body longs for 

is not & never has been 
some petite mort, 
a true thing 

known to grass 
& the elderly man 
with a kind word 

in greeting. And 
the woman saying 
that she is about 

to come, as in 
going to arrive-- 
at last to fill 

the body held so long 
by stewards 
in her name.





Two Girls
 

Eighteen-sixty eighteen sixty-four,   
six hundred ten thousand men   
gaseous gray, blackened body parts   
like chopped wood in Virginia sunshine.   
Or nineteen-fourteen nineteen-eighteen,   
trench rats, thousands, big as badgers,   
rip chines from horse and human flesh.   
IED's, cluster bombs, punji sticks,   
primed to shred feet, thighs, spine, sack,   
yesterday, when we were countless. 
Conscience says Count them up and be good,   
suck on me like red candy stick 
in casual lookaway moments.   
Protected by neighbors, two girls   
villagers know to be deficient   
doll themselves up as bombs   
for market day's chickens and yams, 
and like a world-body neural surge,   
their protectors fly into fatty parts.





The Owl
 

Beneath her nest, 
a shrew's head, 
a finch's beak 
and the bones 
of a quail attest 

the owl devours 
the hour,   
and disregards   
the rest.





A Word on Verbs
 

It's often those 
          who talk a streak 

on world affairs 
          and love and peace 

who seem to love 
          and peace the least.





Change
 

Change is the new, 

improved 

word for god, 

lovely enough 
to raise a song 

or implicate 

a sea of wrongs, 
mighty enough, 

like other gods, 

to shelter, 
bring together, 

and estrange us. 

Please, god, 
we seem to say, 

change us.





Works on Paper
 

1 

It opens as a long lamplit evening 
with Rembrandt, stretched out with the glossy book 
of his Works on Paper. Brown-petal etchings and drawings: 
nut-brown, browner, irreclaimable rills 

of iron-gall ink sucked and feathered into 
the paper's wan cusps and culverts. The ink...it's as if 
there's no pulling away from the wet, flowing line 
to the tiny hedge-village perched on the edge of the cliff 

and the paper. Here the ink's overwatered 
and we barely, down in the forested loam, 
disengage the gentle saint, his rounded hat molding 
his crown like thatch on low rooftrees...St. Jerome. 


                                     2 

Hunched, sunk in a deep-toned wash, 
he cares only for the huge, softleaved book 
propped on his knees. At nightfall Jerome swallowed up 
by his Bible misses the wistful look 

of his lion withdrawn to the forested ridge, 
the drawing's diagonal. And from there, one can say 
that landscape exists: prowls and spinnies 
where a lion might wind a lioness, or his prey... 

He looks out on tree-clouded peaks, tiny hamlets, 
two lambs in a wattle-fold. What the lion sees, we see. 
For Jerome, though, the lion is Judah, his seal and seed-- 
Jesse's stem drops thickset leaves for him to read. 


                                     3 

Saskia, of course, thrones in painting. Still, 
tiny sketches tumble from odd cabinets: 
the dear in a lopsided turban or twilled 
garden hat, sketched "on my wedding-day"-- 

Saskia. A cluster of lines, a rippled race 
of curls and cloudsets. And, for a rarity, 
in Rembrandt, flowers. The simple, surprised, smiling face 
of Saskia as Flora...After her fourth lying-in 

(she was dying), he took to long walks 
on the city's outskirts; his sketchbook came home 
with mere touches of charcoal, a reed, a waterfowl, 
estuarial shallows unfolding to the rim. 


                                     4 

Now life is meaner, chaotic. Rushes of arousal, 
lawsuits, debts...this print of a kitchen drab, 
eyes wandering, mouth a vacant, uptilted half-lune, 
her work-swollen hands on Saskia's velvet shawl, 

The thighs parted, abdomen pear-pendulant, 
the pulled-off stocking-stays grooved in the flab 
to her copse of cross-hatchings--No one 
wants to see this. But his hand made 

this stock, of himself the substance and seed. Fine- 
spun cosmos, brown tangle, soft sign: 
the old man spares us nothing. The book, 
the look, the lieu, the end of the Line.





Communion
 

If I'm you, or you me-- 
Interpenetrating God-- 
enlarge our intimacy. 

You who are animus    
and blood-- 
who make me dust 

from this table 
blown into grass,   
invisible-- 

Is it you--or I-- 
I pass 
and cannot see?





You and your whole race.
 

You and your whole race. 
Look down upon the town in which you live 
And be ashamed. 
Look down upon white folks   
And upon yourselves   
And be ashamed 
That such supine poverty exists there, 
That such stupid ignorance breeds children there 
Behind such humble shelters of despair-- 
That you yourselves have not the sense to care 
Nor the manhood to stand up and say 
I dare you to come one step nearer, evil world, 
With your hands of greed seeking to touch my throat, I dare you to come one step nearer me: 
                        When you can say that 
                        you will be free! 






I look at the world
 

I look at the world 
From awakening eyes in a black face-- 
And this is what I see: 
This fenced-off narrow space   
Assigned to me. 

I look then at the silly walls 
Through dark eyes in a dark face-- 
And this is what I know: 
That all these walls oppression builds 
Will have to go! 

I look at my own body   
With eyes no longer blind-- 
And I see that my own hands can make 
The world that's in my mind. 
Then let us hurry, comrades, 
The road to find.





Remember
 

Remember 
The days of bondage-- 
And remembering-- 
Do not stand still. 
Go to the highest hill 
And look down upon the town 
Where you are yet a slave. 
Look down upon any town in Carolina 
Or any town in Maine, for that matter, 
Or Africa, your homeland-- 
And you will see what I mean for you to see-- 
             The white hand: 
             The thieving hand. 
             The white face: 
             The lying face. 
             The white power: 
             The unscrupulous power 
That makes of you 
The hungry wretched thing you are today.





The Days Gone By
 

O the days gone by! O the days gone by! 
The apples in the orchard, and the pathway through the rye; 
The chirrup of the robin, and the whistle of the quail 
As he piped across the meadows sweet as any nightingale; 
When the bloom was on the clover, and the blue was in the sky, 
And my happy heart brimmed over in the days gone by. 

In the days gone by, when my naked feet were tripped 
By the honey-suckle's tangles where the water-lilies dipped, 
And the ripples of the river lipped the moss along the brink 
Where the placid-eyed and lazy-footed cattle came to drink, 
And the tilting snipe stood fearless of the truant's wayward cry 
And the splashing of the swimmer, in the days gone by. 

O the days gone by! O the days gone by! 
The music of the laughing lip, the luster of the eye; 
The childish faith in fairies, and Aladdin's magic ring-- 
The simple, soul-reposing, glad belief in everything,-- 
When life was like a story, holding neither sob nor sigh, 
In the golden olden glory of the days gone by.





No Classes!
 

No classes here! Why, that is idle talk.
   The village beau sneers at the country boor;
The importuning mendicants who walk
   Our cites' streets despise the parish poor.

The daily toiler at some noisy loom
   Holds back her garments from the kitchen aid.
Meanwhile the latter leans upon her broom,
   Unconscious of the bow the laundress made.

The grocer's daughter eyes the farmer's lass
   With haughty glances; and the lawyer's wife
Would pay no visits to the trading class,
   If policy were not her creed in life.

The merchant's son nods coldly at the clerk;
   The proud possessor of a pedigree
Ignores the youth whose father rose by work;
   The title-seeking maiden scorns all three.

The aristocracy of blood looks down
   Upon the nouveau riche; and in disdain,
The lovers of the intellectual frown
   On both, and worship at the shrine of brain.

No classes here, the clergyman has said;
   We are one family. Yet see his rage
And horror when his favorite son would wed
   Some pure and pretty player on the stage.

It is the vain but natural way
   Of vaunting our weak selves, our pride, our worth!
Not till the long delayed millennial day
   Shall we behold no classes on God's earth.





The Sonnet
 

Alone it stands in Poesy's fair land, 
   A temple by the muses set apart; 
   A perfect structure of consummate art, 
By artists builded and by genius planned. 
Beyond the reach of the apprentice hand, 
   Beyond the ken of the unturtored heart, 
   Like a fine carving in a common mart, 
Only the favored few will understand. 
A chef-d'oeuvre toiled over with great care, 
   Yet which the unseeing careless crowd goes by, 
A plainly set, but well-cut solitaire, 
An ancient bit of pottery, too rare 
   To please or hold aught save the special eye, 
These only with the sonnet can compare.





The Engine
 

Into the gloom of the deep, dark night,
   With panting breath and a startled scream;
Swift as a bird in sudden flight
   Darts this creature of steel and steam.

Awful dangers are lurking nigh,
   Rocks and chasms are near the track,
But straight by the light of its great white eye
   It speeds through the shadows, dense and black.

Terrible thoughts and fierce desires
   Trouble its mad heart many an hour,
Where burn and smoulder the hidden fires,
   Coupled ever with might and power.

It hates, as a wild horse hates the rein,
   The narrow track by vale and hill;
And shrieks with a cry of startled pain,
   And longs to follow its own wild will.





Nothing New
 

Oh, what am I but an engine, shod
   With muscle and flesh, by the hand of God,
Speeding on through the dense, dark night,
   Guided alone by the soul's white light.

Often and often my mad heart tires,
   And hates its way with a bitter hate,
And longs to follow its own desires,
   And leave the end in the hands of fate.

O, mighty engine of steel and steam;
   O, human engine of blood and bone,
Follow the white light's certain beam--
   There lies safety, and there alone.

The narrow track of fearless truth,
   Lit by the soul's great eye of light,
O passionate heart of restless youth,
   Alone will carry you through the night.





Sonnet XXV
 

As in the midst of battle there is room 
For thoughts of love, and in foul sin for mirth; 
As gossips whisper of a trinket's worth 
Spied by the death-bed's flickering candle-gloom; 
As in the crevices of Caesar's tomb 
The sweet herbs flourish on a little earth: 
So in this great disaster of our birth 
We can be happy, and forget our doom. 
For morning, with a ray of tenderest joy 
Gilding the iron heaven, hides the truth, 
And evening gently woos us to employ 
Our grief in idle catches. Such is youth; 
Till from that summer's trance we wake, to find 
Despair before us, vanity behind.





On a Piece of Tapestry
 

Hold high the woof, dear friends, that we may see 
The cunning mixture of its colours rare. 
Nothing in nature purposely is fair,-- 
Her beauties in their freedom disagree; 
But here all vivid dyes that garish be, 
To that tint mellowed which the sense will bear, 
Glow, and not wound the eye that, resting there, 
Lingers to feed its gentle ecstacy. 
Crimson and purple and all hues of wine, 
Saffron and russet, brown and sober green 
Are rich the shadowy depths of blue between; 
While silver threads with golden intertwine, 
To catch the glimmer of a fickle sheen,-- 
All the long labour of some captive queen. 








Before a Statue of Achilles
 

                                    I 

Behoild Pelides with his yellow hair, 
Proud child of Thetis, hero loved of Jove; 
Above the frowning of his brows of wove 
A crown of gold, well combed, with Spartan care. 
Who might have seen him, sullen, great, and fair, 
As with the wrongful world he proudly strove, 
And by high deeds his wilder passion shrove, 
Mastering love, resentment, and despair. 
He knew his end, and Phoebus' arrow sure 
He braved for fame immortal and a friend, 
Despising life; and we, who know our end, 
Know that in our decay he shall endure 
And all our children's hearts to grief inure, 
With whose first bitter battles his shall blend. 

                                    II 

Who brought thee forth, immortal vision, who 
In Phthia or in Tempe brought thee forth? 
Out of the sunlight and the sapful earth 
What god the simples of thy spirit drew? 
A goddess rose from the green waves, and threw 
Her arms about a king, to give thee birth; 
A centaur, patron of thy boyish mirth, 
Over the meadows in thy footsteps flew. 
Now Thessaly forgets thee, and the deep 
Thy keeled bark furrowed answers not thy prayer; 
But far away new generations keep 
Thy laurels fresh; where branching Isis hems 
The lawns of Oxford round about, or where 
Enchanted Eton sits by pleasant Thames. 

                                    III 

I gaze on thee as Phidias of old 
Or Polyclitus gazed, when first he saw 
These hard and shining limbs, without a flaw, 
And cast his wonder in heroic mould. 
Unhappy me who only may behold, 
Nor make immutable and fix in awe 
A fair immortal form no worm shall gnaw, 
A tempered mind whose faith was never told! 
The godlike mien, the lion's lock and eye, 
The well-knit sinew, utter a brave heart 
Better than many words that part by part 
Spell in strange symbols what serene and whole 
In nature lives, nor can in marble die. 
The perfect body itself the soul.





The Sermon on the Warpland
 

"The fact that we are black  is our ultimate reality.  --Ron Karenga  

And several strengths from drowsiness campaigned 
but spoke in Single Sermon on the warpland. 

And went about the warpland saying No. 
"My people, black and black, revile the River. 
Say that the River turns, and turn the River. 

Say that our Something in doublepod contains 
sees for the coming hell and health together. 
Prepare to meet 
(sisters, brothers) the brash and terrible weather; 
the pains; 
the bruising; the collapse of bestials, idols. 
But then oh then!--the stuffing of the hulls! 
the seasoning of the perilously sweet! 
the health! The heralding of the clear obscure! 

Build now your Church, my brothers, sisters. Build 
never with brick or Corten nor with granite. 
Build with lithe love. With love like lion-eyes. 
with love like morningrise. 
with love like black, our black-- 
luminously indiscreet; 
complete; continuous.





For the Old Gnostics
 

The Fathers put their trust in the end of the world 
And they were wrong.   The Gnostics were right and not 
Right.   Dragons copulate with their knobby tails. 
Some somnolent wealth rises unconcerned, 
Over there!   In the world!   Ponderous stubborn 
Sorrow weighs down the flying Gospels. 
Some enormous obstacle blocks our way. 
The untempered soul grumbles in empty light.





The Fat Old Couple Whirling Around
 

The drum says that the night we die will be a long night. 
It says the children have time to play. Tell the grownups 
They can pull the curtains around the bed tonight. 

The old man wants to know how the war ended. 
The young girl wants her breasts to cause the sun to rise. 
The thinker wants to keep misunderstanding alive. 

It's all right if the earthly monk is buried near the altar. 
It's all right if the singer fails to turn up for her concert. 
It's good if the fat old couple keeps whirling around. 

Let the parents sing over the cradle every night. 
Let the pelicans go on living in their stickly nests. 
Let the duck go on loving the mud around her feet. 

It's all right if the ant always remembers his way home. 
It's all right if Bach keeps reaching for the same note. 
It's all right if we knock the ladder away from the house. 

Even if you are a puritan it would be all right 
If you join the lovers in their ruined house tonight. 
It's good if you become a soul and then disappear.





Apprehension
 

Oh! sister, he is so swift and tall, 
Though I want the ride, he will spoil it all, 
For, when he sets out, he will let me fall, 
   And give me a bump, I know! 
Mamma, what was it I heard you say, 
About the world's hobbies, the other day, 
How some would get on and gallop away,    
   To end with an overthrow?' 

I said, little prattler, the world was a race, 
That many would mount with a smile on the face, 
And ride to their ruin, or fall in disgrace: 
   That him, who was deaf to fear, 
And did not look our for a rein or a guide, 
His courser might cast on the highway side, 
In the mud, rocks and brambles, to end his ride, 
   Perchance with a sight and a tear!' 

Oh! sister, sister! I fear to try; 
For Brutus's back is so live and high! 
It creeps at my touch  and he winks his eye--   
   I'm sure he is going to jump! 
Come! dear mother, tell us some more 
About the world's ride, as you did before, 
Who helped it up  and all how it bore 
   The fall, and got over the bump!'






The Butterflys Dream
 

A tulip, just opened, had offered to hold 
   A butterfly, gaudy and gay; 
And, rocked in a cradle of crimson and gold, 
   The careless young slumberer lay. 

For the butterfly slept, as such thoughtless ones will, 
   At ease, and reclining on flowers, 
If ever they study, 't is how they may kill 
   The best of their mid-summer hours. 

And the butterfly dreamed, as is often the case 
   With indolent lovers of change, 
Who, keeping the body at ease in its place, 
   Give fancy permission to range. 

He dreamed that he saw, what he could but despise, 
   The swarm from a neighbouring hive; 
Which, having come out for their winter supplies, 
   Had made the whole garden alive. 

He looked with disgust, as the proud often do, 
   On the diligent movements of those, 
Who, keeping both present and future in view, 
   Improve every hour as it goes. 

As the brisk little alchymists passed to and fro, 
   With anger the butterfly swelled; 
And called them mechanics  a rabble too low 
   To come near the station he held. 

Away from my presence!' said he, in his sleep, 
   Ye humbled plebeians! nor dare 
Come here with your colorless winglets to sweep 
   The king of this brilliant parterre!' 

He thought, at these words, that together they flew, 
   And, facing about, made a stand; 
And then, to a terrible army they grew, 
   And fenced him on every hand. 

Like hosts of huge giants, his numberless foes 
   Seemed spreading to measureless size: 
Their wings with a mighty expansion arose, 
   And stretched like a veil o'er the skies. 

Their eyes seemed like little volcanoes, for fire,--   
   Their hum, to a cannon-peal grown,-- 
Farina to bullets was rolled in their ire, 
   And, he thought, hurled at him and his throne. 

He tried to cry quarter! his voice would not sound, 
   His head ached  his throne reeled and fell; 
His enemy cheered, as he came to the ground, 
   And cried, King Papilio, farewell!' 

His fall chased the vision  the sleeper awoke, 
   The wonderful dream to expound; 
The lightning's bright flash from the thunder-cloud broke, 
   And hail-stones were rattling around. 

He'd slumbered so long, that now, over his head, 
   The tempest's artillery rolled; 
The tulip was shattered  the whirl-blast had fled, 
   And borne off its crimson and gold. 

'T is said, for the fall and the pelting, combined 
   With suppressed ebullitions of pride, 
This vain son of summer no balsam could find, 
   But he crept under covert and died.






The Childs Address to the Kentucky Mummy
 

And now, Mistress Mummy, since thus you've been found 
   By the world, that has long done without you, 
In your snug little hiding-place far under ground-- 
Be pleased to speak out, as we gather around, 
   And let us hear something about you! 

By the style of your dress you are not Madam Eve--   
   You of course had a father and mother; 
No more of your line have we power to conceive, 
As you furnish us nothing by which to believe 
   You had husband, child, sister, or brother. 

We know you have lived, though we cannot tell when, 
   And that too by eating and drinking, 
To judge by your teeth, and the lips you had then 
And we see you are one of the children of men, 
   Though long from their looks you've been shrinking. 

Who was it that made you a cavern so deep, 
   Refused your poor head a last pillow, 
And bad you sit still when you'd sunken to sleep, 
And they'd bound you and muffled you up in a heap 
   Of clothes made of hempen and willow? 

Say, whose was the ear that could hear with delight 
   The musical trinket found nigh you? 
And who had the eye that was pleased with the sight 
Of this form (whose queer face might be brown, red, or white,) 
   Trick'd out in the jewels kept by you?






Death of an Infant
 

Death found strange beauty on that cherub brow, 
And dash'd it out.  There was a tint of rose 
O'er cheek and lip;  he touch'd the veins with ice, 
And the rose faded.  Forth from those blue eyes 
There spake a wistful tenderness,  a doubt 
Whether to grieve or sleep, which Innocence   
Alone can wear.  With ruthless haste he bound 
The silken fringes of their curtaining lids 
Forever.  There had been a murmuring sound 
With which the babe would claim its mother's ear, 
Charming her even to tears.  The spoiler set 
His seal of silence.  But there beam'd a smile, 
So fix'd and holy from that marble brow, 
Death gazed and left it there;  he dared not steal 
The signet-ring of Heaven.






Indian Names
 

How can the red men be forgotten, while so many of our states and territories, bays, lakes, and rivers, are indelibly stamped by names of their giving?'
Ye say they all have passed away, 
   That noble race and brave, 
That their light canoes have vanished 
   From off the crested wave; 
That 'mid the forests where they roamed 
   There rings no hunter shout, 
But their name is on your waters, 
   Ye may not wash it out. 

'Tis where Ontario's billow 
   Like Ocean's surge is curled, 
Where strong Niagara's thunders wake 
   The echo of the world. 
Where red Missouri bringeth 
   Rich tribute from the west, 
And Rappahannock sweetly sleeps 
   On green Virginia's breast. 

Ye say their cone-like cabins, 
   That clustered o'er the vale, 
Have fled away like withered leaves 
   Before the autumn gale, 
But their memory liveth on your hills, 
   Their baptism on your shore, 
Your everlasting rivers speak 
   Their dialect of yore. 

Old Massachusetts wears it, 
   Within her lordly crown, 
And broad Ohio bears it, 
   Amid his young renown; 
Connecticut hath wreathed it 
   Where her quiet foliage waves, 
And bold Kentucky breathed it hoarse 
   Through all her ancient caves. 

Wachuset hides its lingering voice 
   Within his rocky heart, 
And Alleghany graves its tone 
   Throughout his lofty chart; 
Monadnock on his forehead hoar 
   Doth seal the sacred trust, 
Your mountains build their monument, 
   Though ye destroy their dust. 

Ye call these red-browned brethren 
   The insects of an hour, 
Crushed like the noteless worm amid 
   The regions of their power; 
Ye drive them from their father's lands, 
   Ye break of faith the seal, 
But can ye from the court of Heaven   
   Exclude their last appeal? 

Ye see their unresisting tribes, 
   With toilsome step and slow, 
On through the trackless desert pass 
   A caravan of woe; 
Think ye the Eternal's ear is deaf? 
   His sleepless vision dim? 
Think ye the soul's blood may not cry 
   From that far land to him?






Poetry
 

Morn on her rosy couch awoke, 
   Enchantment led the hour, 
And mirth and music drank the dews 
   That freshen'd Beauty's flower, 
Then from her bower of deep delight, 
   I heard a young girl sing, 
Oh, speak no ill of poetry, 
   For 'tis a holy thing.' 

The Sun in noon-day heat rose high, 
   And on the heaving breast, 
I saw a weary pilgrim toil 
   Unpitied and unblest, 
Yet still in trembling measures flow'd 
   Forth from a broken string, 
Oh, speak no ill of poetry, 
   For 'tis a holy thing.' 

'Twas night, and Death the curtains drew, 
   'Mid agony severe, 
While there a willing spirit went 
   Home to a glorious sphere, 
Yet still it sigh'd, even when was spread
   The waiting Angel's wing, 
Oh, speak no ill of poetry, 
   For 'tis a holy thing.'






The Western Emigrant
 

An axe rang sharply 'mid those forest shades 
Which from creation toward the skies had tower'd 
In unshorn beauty. There, with vigorous arm 
Wrought a bold emigrant, and by his side 
His little son, with question and response, 
Beguiled the toil. 
                         Boy, thou hast never seen 
Such glorious trees. Hark, when their giant trunks 
Fall, how the firm earth groans. Rememberest thou 
The mighty river, on whose breast we sail'd, 
So many days, on toward the setting sun? 
Our own Connecticut, compar'd to that, 
Was but a creeping stream.' 
                                         Father, the brook 
That by our door went singing, where I launch'd 
My tiny boat, with my young playmates round, 
When school was o'er, is dearer far to me, 
Than all these bold, broad waters. To my eye 
They are as strangers. And those little trees 
My mother nutur'd in the garden bound, 
Of our first home, from whence the fragrant peach   
Hung in its ripening gold, were fairer sure, 
Than this dark forest, shutting out the day.' 
--What, ho!  my little girl,' and with light step
A fairy creature hasted toward her sire, 
And setting down the basket that contain'd 
His noon-repast, look'd upward to his face 
With sweet, confiding smile. 
                                         See, dearest, see, 
That bright-wing'd paroquet, and hear the song 
Of yon gay red-bird, echoing through the trees, 
Making rich music. Didst thou ever hear, 
In far New England, such a mellow tone?' 
--I had a robin that did take the crumbs 
Each night and morning, and his chirping voice 
Still made me joyful, as I went to tend 
My snow-drops. I was always laughing then 
In that first home. I should be happier now 
Methinks, if I could find among these dells 
The same fresh violets.' 
                                   Slow night drew on, 
And round the rude hut of the Emigrant 
The wrathful spirit of the rising storm 
Spake bitter things. His weary children slept, 
And he, with head declin'd, sat listening long 
To the swoln waters of the Illinois, 
Dashing against their shores. 
                                          Starting he spake,--
Wife! did I see thee brush away a tear? 
'Twas even so. Thy heard was with the halls 
Of thy nativity. Their sparkling lights, 
Carpets, and sofas, and admiring guests, 
Befit thee better than these rugged walls 
Of shapeless logs, and this lone, hermit home.' 
   No  no. All was so still around, methought 
Upon mine ear that echoes hymn did steal, 
Which 'mid the Church where erst we paid our vows, 
So tuneful peal'd. But tenderly thy voice 
Dissolv'd the illusion.' 
                                And the gentle smile 
Lighting her brow, the fond caress that sooth'd 
Her waking infant, reassur'd his soul 
That wheresoe'er our best affections dwell, 
And strike a healthful root, is happiness. 
Content, and placid, to his rest he sank, 
But dreams, those wild magicians, that do play 
Such pranks when reason slumbers, tireless wrought 
Their will with him. 
                            Up rose the thronging mart 
Of his own native city,  roof and spire, 
All glittering bright, in fancy's frost-work ray. 
The steed his boyhood nurtur'd proudly neigh'd, 
The favorite dog came frisking round his feet, 
With shrill and joyous bark,  familiar doors 
Flew open,  greeting hands with his were link'd 
In friendship's grasp,  he heard the keen debate 
From congregated haunts, where mind with mind 
Doth blend and brighten,  and till morning rov'd 
'Mid the loved scenery of his native land.






Meditations
 

Sunday, 12 May 1833
The clouds are marshalling across the sky, 
Leaving their deepest tints upon yon range 
Of soul-alluring hills. The breeze comes softly, 
Laden with tribute that a hundred orchards 
Now in their fullest blossom send, in thanks 
For this refreshing shower. The birds pour forth 
In heightened melody the notes of praise 
They had suspended while God's voice was speaking, 
And his eye flashing down upon his world. 
I sigh, half-charmed, half-pained. My sense is living, 
And, taking in this freshened beauty, tells 
Its pleasure to the mind. The mind replies, 
And strives to wake the heart in turn, repeating 
Poetic sentiments from many a record 
Which other souls have left, when stirred and satisfied 
By scenes as fair, as fragrant. But the heart 
Sends back a hollow echo to the call 
Of outward things, -- and its once bright companion, 
Who erst would have been answered by a stream 
Of life-fraught treasures, thankful to be summoned, -- 
Can now rouse nothing better than this echo; 
Unmeaning voice, which mocks their softened accents. 
Content thee, beautiful world! and hush, still busy mind! 
My heart hath sealed its fountains. To the things 
Of Time they shall be oped no more. Too long, 
Too often were they poured forth: part have sunk 
Into the desert; part profaned and swollen 
By bitter waters, mixed by those who feigned 
They asked them for refreshment, which, turned back, 
Have broken and o'erflowed their former urns. 
So when ye talk of pleasure, lonely world, 
And busy mind, ye ne'er again shall move me 
To answer ye, though still your calls have power 
To jar me through, and cause dull aching here. 

No so the voice which hailed me from the depths 
Of yon dark-bosomed cloud, now vanishing 
Before the sun ye greet. It touched my centre, 
The voice of the Eternal, calling me 
To feel his other worlds; to feel that if 
I could deserve a home, I still might find it 
In other spheres, -- and bade me not despair, 
Though want of harmony' and aching void' 
Are terms invented by the men of this, 
Which I may not forget. 
                                 In former times 
I loved to see the lightnings flash athwart 
The stooping heavens; I loved to hear the thunder 
Call to the seas and mountains; for I thought 
Tis thus man's flashing fancy doth enkidle 
The firmament of mind; tis thus his eloquence   
Calls unto the soul's depths and heights; and still 
I defied the creature, nor remembered 
The Creator in his works. 
                                    Ah now how different! 
The proud delight of that keen sympathy 
Is gone; no longer riding on the wave, 
But whelmed beneath it: my own plans and works, 
Or, as the Scriptures phrase it, my 'inventions' 
No longer interpose twist me and Heaven. 

Today, for the first time, I felt the Deity, 
And uttered prayer on hearing thunder. This 
Must be thy will, -- for finer, higher spirits 
Have gone through this same process, -- yet I think 
There was religion in that strong delight, 
Those sounds, those thoughts of power imparted. True, 
I did not say, He is the Lord thy God,' 
But I had feeling of his essence. But 
'Twas pride by which the angels fell.' So be it! 
But O, might I but see a little onward! 
Father, I cannot be a spirit of power; 
May I be active as a spirit of love, 
Since thou hast ta'en me from that path which Nature 
Seemed to appoint, O, deign to ope another, 
Where I may walk with thought and hope assured; 
Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief!' 
Had I but faith like that which fired Novalis, 
I too could bear that the heart fall in ashes,' 
While the freed spirit rises from beneath them, 
With heavenward-look, and Phoenix-plumes upsoaring!






The One in All
 

There are who separate the eternal light 
In forms of man and woman, day and night; 
They cannot bear that God be essence quite. 

Existence is as deep a verity: 
Without the dual, where is unity? 
And the I am' cannot forbear to be; 

But from its primal nature forced to frame 
Mysteries, destinies of various name, 
Is forced to give what it has taught to claim. 

Thus love must answer to its own unrest; 
The bad commands us to expect the best, 
And hope of its own prospects is the test. 

And dost thou seek to find the one in two? 
Only upon the old can build the new; 
The symbol which you seek is found in you. 

The heart and mind, the wisdom and the will, 
The man and woman, must be severed still, 
And Christ must reconcile the good and ill. 

There are to whom each symbol is a mask; 
The life of love is a mysterious task; 
They want no answer, for they would not ask. 

A single thought transfuses every form; 
The sunny day is changed into the storm, 
For light is dark, hard soft, and cold is warm. 

One presence fills and floods the whole serene; 
Nothing can be, nothing has ever been, 
Except the one truth that creates the scene. 

Does the heart beat, -- that is a seeming only; 
You cannot be alone, though you are lonely; 
The All is neutralized in the One only. 

You ask a faith, -- they are content with faith; 
You ask to have, -- but they reply, IT hath.' 
There is no end, and there need be no path. 

The day wears heavily, -- why, then, ignore it; 
Peace is the soul's desire, -- such thoughts restore it; 
The truth thou art, -- it needs not to implore it. 

The Presence all thy fancies supersedes, 
All that is done which thou wouldst seek in deeds, 
The wealth obliterates all seeming needs. 

Both these are true, and if they are at strife, 
The mystery bears the one name of Life, 
That, slowly spelled, will yet compose the strife. 

The men of old say, Live twelve thousand years, 
And see the need of all that here appears, 
And Moxen* shall absorb thy smiles and tears.' 

These later men say, Live this little day. 
Believe that human nature is the way, 
And know both Son and Father while you pray; 

And one in two, in three, and none alone, 
Letting you know even as you are known, 
Shall make the you and me eternal parts of one.' 

To me, our destinies seem flower and fruit 
Born of an ever-generating root; 
The other statement I cannot dispute. 

But say that Love and Life eternal seem, 
And if eternal ties be but a dream, 
What is the meaning of that self-same seem? 

Your nature craves Eternity for Truth; 
Eternity of Love is prayer of youth; 
How, without love, would have gone forth your truth? 

I do not think we are deceived to grow, 
But that the crudest fancy, slightest show, 
Covers some separate truth that we may know. 

In the one Truth, each separate fact is true; 
Eternally in one I many view, 
And destinies through destiny pursue. 

This is my tendency; but can I say 
That this my thought leads the true, only way? 
I only know it constant leads, and I obey. 

I only know one prayer -- Give me the truth, 
Give me that colored whiteness, ancient youth, 
Complex and simple, seen in joy and truth. 

Let me not by vain wishes bar my claim, 
Nor soothe my hunger by an empty name,   
Nor crucify the Son of man by hasty blame. 

But in the earth and fire, water and air, 
Live earnestly by turns without despair, 
Nor seek a home till home be every where!'






from Lyrics of the Street
 

Outside the Party
Thick throng the snow-flakes, the evening is dreary,
Glad rings the music in yonder gay hall;
On her who listens here, friendless and weary,
Heavier chill than the winter's doth fall.

At yon clear window, light-opened before me,
Glances the face I have worshipped so well:
There's the fine gentleman, grand in his glory;
There, the fair smile by whose sweetness I fell.

This is akin to him, shunned and forsaken,
That at my bosom sobs low, without bread;
Had not such pleading my marble heart shaken,
I had been quiet, long since, with the dead.

Oh! Could I enter there, ghastly and squalid,
Stand in men's eyes with my spirit o'erborne,
Show them where roses bloomed, crushed now and pallid,
What he found innocent, leaving forlorn,--

How the fair ladies would fail from their dances,
Trembling, aghast at my horrible tale!
How would he shrink from my words and my glances!
How would they shrink from him, swooning and pale!

This is the hair that was soft to enchain him;
Snakelike, it snarls on my beautiless brow:
These are the hands that were fond to detain him
With a sense-magic then, powerless now!

No: could I come, like a ghost, to affright him,
How should that heal my wound, silence my pain?
Had I the wrath of God's lightning to smite him,
That could not bring me my lost peace again.

Ne'er let him grieve while good fortunes betide him,
Ne'er count again the poor game lost of old;
When he comes forth, with his young bride beside him,
Here shall they find us both, dead in the cold.







from Lyrics of the Street
 

Street Yarn
Roses caged in windows, heighten
    Your faint blooms today;
Silks and sheeny satins, brighten;
    He has passed this way!

Could ye keep his fleeting presence
    Gone beyond recall,
But a little of his essence,
    I would have you all.

Arabesque so quaint and shady,
    That mightst catch his eye
To adorn a stately lady
    Ere her hour went by,

Canst assure me that his glancing
    Rested on they fold?
Did that set your purples dancing?
    Wake the sleepy gold?

Ye neglected apple-venders
    Mouldering in the street,
Did he curse between your tenders,
    Spurning with his feet?

Then must I an alms deliver
    For his graceless pride;
Could I buy his sins forever,
    I'd not be denied.

Paying patiently his ransom
    Never conscience-pricked;
Cheating Justice of her handsome
    Heartless derelict.

Did he view thee, ancient steeple,
    With thy weird clock-face,
Frowning down on sinful people
    Passing out of grace?

Nay, respond not to my question
    With thy prate of time:
Things to which my soul must hasten
    Lie beyond thy chime.

With no circumstance to screen us,
    We must meet again:
I shall bid God judge between us,
    Answering Amen.







The House of Rest
 

I will build a house of rest, 
Square the corners every one: 
At each angle on his breast 
Shall a cherub take the sun; 
Rising, risen, sinking, down, 
Weaving day's unequal crown. 

In the chambers, light as air, 
Shall responsive footsteps fall: 
Brother, sister, art thou there? 
Hush! we need not jar nor call; 
Need not turn to seek the face 
Shut in rapture's hiding-place. 

Heavy load and mocking care 
Shall from back and bosom part; 
Thought shall reach the thrill of prayer, 
Patience plan the dome of art. 
None shall praise or merit claim, 
Not a joy be called by name. 

With a free, unmeasured tread 
Shall we pace the cloisters through: 
Rest, enfranchised, like the Dead; 
Rest till Love be born anew. 
Weary Thought shall take his time, 
Free of task-work, loosed from rhyme. 

No reproof shall grieve or chill; 
Every sin doth stand confest; 
None need murmur, This was ill': 
Therefore do they grant us rest; 
Contemplation making whole 
Every ruin of the soul. 

Pictures shall as softly look 
As in distance shows delight; 
Slowly shall each saintly book 
Turn its pages in our sight; 
Not the study's wealth confuse, 
Urging zeal to pale abuse. 

Children through the windows peep, 
Not reproachful, though our own; 
Hushed the parent passion deep, 
And the household's eager tone. 
One above, divine and true, 
Makes us children like to you. 

Measured bread shall build us up 
At the hospitable board; 
In Contentment's golden cup 
Is the guileless liquor poured. 
May the beggar pledge the king 
In that spirit gathering, 

Oh! my house is far away; 
Yet it sometimes shuts me in. 
Imperfection mars each day 
While the perfect works begin. 
In the house of labor best 
Can I build the house of rest.






The Window Just Over the Street
 

I sit in my sorrow a-weary, alone; 
    I have nothing sweet to hope or remember, 
For the spring o' th' year and of life has flown; 
    'Tis the wildest night o' the wild December,   
And dark in my spirit and dark in my chamber. 

I sit and list to the steps in the street, 
    Going and coming, and coming and going, 
And the winds at my shutter they blow and beat; 
    'Tis the middle of night and the clouds are snowing; 
    And the winds are bitterly beating and blowing. 

I list to the steps as they come and go, 
    And list to the winds that are beating and blowing, 
And my heart sinks down so low, so low; 
    No step is stayed from me by the snowing, 
    Nor stayed by the wind so bitterly blowing. 

I think of the ships that are out at sea, 
    Of the wheels in th' cold, black waters turning; 
Not one of the ships beareth news to me, 
    And my head is sick, and my heart is yearning, 
    As I think of the wheels in the black waters turning. 

Of the mother I think, by her sick baby's bed, 
    Away in her cabin as lonesome and dreary, 
And little and low as the flax-breaker's shed; 
    Of her patience so sweet, and her silence so weary, 
    With cries of the hungry wolf hid in the prairie. 

I think of all things in the world that are sad; 
    Of children in homesick and comfortless places; 
Of prisons, of dungeons, of men that are mad; 
    Of wicked, unwomanly light in the faces 
    Of women that fortune has wronged with disgraces. 

I think of a dear little sun-lighted head, 
    That came where no hand of us all could deliver; 
And crazed with the cruelest pain went to bed 
    Where the sheets were the foam-fretted waves of the river; 
    Poor darling! may God in his mercy forgive her. 

The footsteps grow faint and more faint in the snow; 
    I put back the curtain in very despairing; 
The masts creak and groan as th' winds come and go; 
    And the light in the light-house all weirdly is flaring; 
    But what glory is this, in the gloom of despairing! 

I see at the window just over the street, 
    A maid in the lamplight her love-letter reading. 
Her red mouth is smiling, her news is so sweet; 
    And the heart in my bosom is cured of its bleeding, 
    As I look on the maiden her love-letter reading. 

She has finished the letter, and folding it, kisses, 
    And hides it -- a secret too sacred to know; 
And now in the hearth-light she softly undresses: 
    A vision of grace in the roseate glow, 
    I see her unbinding the braids of her tresses. 

And now as she stoops to the ribbon that fastens 
    Her slipper, they tumble o'er shoulder and face; 
And now, as she patters in bare feet, she hastens 
    To gather them up in a fillet of lace; 
    And now she is gone, but in fancy I trace 

The lavendered linen updrawn, the round arm 
    Half sunk in the counterpane's broidered roses, 
Revealing the exquisite outline of form; 
    A willowy wonder of grace that reposes 
    Beneath the white counterpane, fleecy with roses. 

I see the small hand lying over the heart, 
    Where the passionate dreams are so sweet in their sally; 
The fair little fingers they tremble and part, 
    As part to th' warm waves the leaves of the lily, 
    And they play with her hand like the waves with the lily. 

In white fleecy flowers, the queen o' the flowers! 
    What to her is the world with its bad, bitter weather? 
Wide she opens her arms -- ah, her world is not ours! 
    And now she has closed them and clasped them together -- 
    What to her is our world, with its clouds and rough weather? 

Hark! midnight! the winds and the snows blow and beat; 
    I drop down the curtain and say to my sorrow, 
Thank God for the window just over the street; 
    Thank God there is always a light whence to borrow 
    When darkness is darkest, and sorrow most sorrow.






Telling Fortunes
 

Be not among wine-bibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh; for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.'  Proverbs, 23: 20, 21 
I'll tell you two fortunes, my fine little lad, 
      For you to accept or refuse. 
The one of them good, and the other one bad; 
      Now hear them, and say which you choose! 

I see by my gift, within reach of your hand, 
      A fortune right fair to behold; 
A house and a hundred good acres of land, 
      With harvest fields yellow as gold. 

I see a great orchard, the boughs hanging down 
      With apples of russet and red; 
I see droves of cattle, some white and brown, 
      But all of them sleek and well-fed. 

I see doves and swallows about the barn doors, 
      See the fanning-mill whirling so fast, 
See men that are threshing the wheat on the floors; 
      And now the bright picture is past! 

And I see, rising dismally up in the place 
      Of the beautiful house and the land, 
A man with a fire-red nose on his face, 
      And a little brown jug in his hand! 

Oh! if you beheld him, my lad, you would wish 
      That he were less wretched to see; 
For his boot-toes, they gape like the mouth of a fish, 
      And his trousers are out at the knee! 

In walking he staggers, now this way, now that, 
      And his eyes they stand out like a bug's, 
And he wears an old coat and a battered-in hat, 
      And I think that the fault is the jug's! 

For our text says the drunkard shall come to be poor, 
      And drowsiness clothes men with rags; 
And he doesn't look much like a man, I am sure, 
      Who has honest hard cash in his bags. 

Now which will you choose? to be thrifty and snug, 
      And to be right side up with your dish; 
Or to go with your eyes like the eyes of a bug, 
      And your shoes like the mouth of a fish!





Nameless Pain
 

I should be happy with my lot: 
A wife and mother  is it not 
Enough for me to be content? 
What other blessing could be sent? 

A quiet house, and homely ways, 
That make each day like other days; 
I only see Time's shadow now 
Darken the hair on baby's brow! 

No world's work ever comes to me, 
No beggar brings his misery; 
I have no power, no healing art 
With bruised soul or broken heart. 

I read the poets of the age, 
'Tis lotus-eating in a cage; 
I study Art, but Art is dead 
To one who clamors to be fed 

With milk from Nature's rugged breast, 
Who longs for Labor's lusty rest. 
O foolish wish! I still should pine 
If nay other lot were mine.






The Wife Speaks
 

Husband, today could you and I behold   
The sun that brought us to our bridal morn 
Rising so splendid in the winter sky 
(We though fair spring returned), when we were wed; 
Could the shades vanish from these fifteen years, 
Which stand like columns guarding the approach 
To that great temple of the double soul 
That is as one  would you turn back, my dear, 
And, for the sake of Love's mysterious dream, 
As old as Adam and as sweet as Eve, 
Take me, as I took you, and once more go 
Towards that goal which none of us have reached? 
Contesting battles which but prove a loss, 
The victor vanquished by the wounded one; 
Teaching each other sacrifice of self, 
True immolation to the marriage bond; 
Learning the joys of birth, the woe of death, 
Leaving in chaos all the hopes of life--
Heart-broken, yet with courage pressing on 
For fame and fortune, artists needing both? 
Or, would you rather  I will acquiesce-- 
Since we must choose what is, and are grown gray, 
Stay in life's desert, watch our setting sun, 
Calm as those statues in Egyptian sands, 
Hand clasping hand, with patience and with peace, 
Wait for a future which contains no past?






Before the Mirror
 

Now like the Lady of Shalott, 
   I dwell within an empty room, 
And through the day and through the night 
   I sit before an ancient loom. 

And like the Lady of Shalott 
   I look into a mirror wide, 
Where shadows come, and shadows go, 
   And ply my shuttle as they glide. 

Not as she wove the yellow wool, 
   Ulysses' wife, Penelope; 
By day a queen among her maids, 
   But in the night a woman, she, 

Who, creeping from her lonely couch, 
   Unraveled all the slender woof; 
Or, with a torch, she climbed the towers, 
   To fire the fagots on the roof! 

But weaving with a steady hand 
   The shadows, whether false or true, 
I put aside a doubt which asks 
   Among these phantoms what are you?' 

For not with altar, tomb, or urn, 
   Or long-haired Greek with hollow shield, 
Or dark-prowed ship with banks of oars, 
   Or banquet in the tented field; 

Or Norman knight in armor clad, 
   Waiting a foe where four roads meet; 
Or hawk and hound in bosky dell, 
   Where dame and page in secret greet; 

Or rose and lily, bud and flower, 
   My web is broidered. Nothing bright 
Is woven here: the shadows grow 
   Still darker in the mirror's light! 

And as my web grows darker too, 
   Accursed seems this empty room; 
For still I must forever weave 
   These phantoms by this ancient loom.






Harvest Gathering
 

The last days of the summer: bright and clear 
    Shines the warm sun down on the quiet land, 
Where corn-fields, thick and heavy in the ear, 
    Are slowly ripening for the laborer's hand; 
Seed-time and harvest -- since the bow was set, 
Not vainly has man hoped your coming yet! 

To the quick rush of sickles, joyously 
    The reapers in the yellow wheat-fields sung, 
And bound the pale sheaves of the ripened rye, 
    When the first tassels of the maize were hung; 
That precious seed into the furrow cast 
Earliest in spring-time, crowns the harvest last. 

Ever, when summer's sun burns faint and dim, 
    And rare and few the pleasant days are given, 
When the sweet praise of our thankgiving hymn 
    Makes beautiful music in the ear of Heaven, 
I think of other harvests whence the sound 
Of singing comes not as the sheaves are bound. 

Not where the rice-fields whiten in the sun, 
      And the warm South casts down her yellow fruit, 
Shout they the labors of the autumn done --   
      For there Oppression casts her deadly root, 
And they, who sow and gather in that clime 
Share not the treasures of the harvest-time. 

God of the seasons! thou who didst ordain 
      Bread for the eater who shall plant the soil, 
How have they heard thee, who have forged the chain 
      And built the dungeon for the sons of toil? 
Burdening their hearts, not with the voice of prayer, 
But the dull cries of almost dumb despair. 

They who would see that growth of wickedness 
      Planted where now the peaceful prairie waves, 
And make the green paths of our wilderness 
      Red with the torn and bleeding feet of slaves -- 
Forbid it, Heaven! and let the sharp axe be 
Laid at the root of that most poison tree! 

Let us behold its deadly leaves begin 
      A fainter shadow o'er the world to cast, 
And the long day that nursed its growth of sin 
      Wane to a sunset that shall be its last; 
So that the day-star, rising from the sea, 
Shall light a land whose children will be free!






Street Music
 

Methought a sweet sound from the street uprose,--    
   And as I pause, and strive again to hear, 
St Patrick's Day' draws softly to its close, 
   And Jordan's' waves flow sweetly to my ear, 
What though from humble source the chorus floats? 
   Music is music, and I listen still; 
I have an ear', -- ay, two! -- Even jews-harp notes 
   Pass current with me, hear them where I will, 
A slight Italian boy, with jetty hair 
   Shading dark eyes, grinds out the melody, 
Pulverized music! -- In his garb and air 
   I read of sunnier lands beyond the sea, 
And, dreaming, wander to a fairer clime, 
Recalled, too suddenly, by -- If you please, a dime!'






Rock Me to Sleep
 

Backward, turn backward, O Time, in your flight, 
Make me a child again just for tonight! 
Mother, come back from the echoless shore, 
Take me again to your heart as of yore; 
Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care, 
Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair; 
Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;--      
Rock me to sleep, mother,  rock me to sleep! 

Backward, flow backward, O tide of the years! 
I am so weary of toil and of tears,--      
Toil without recompense, tears all in vain,--   
Take them, and give me my childhood again! 
I have grown weary of dust and decay,--    
Weary of flinging my soul-wealth away; 
Weary of sowing for others to reap;--    
Rock me to sleep, mother  rock me to sleep! 

Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue, 
Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you! 
Many a summer the grass has grown green, 
Blossomed and faded, our faces between: 
Yet, with strong yearning and passionate pain, 
Long I tonight for your presence again. 
Come from the silence so long and so deep;--    
Rock me to sleep, mother,  rock me to sleep! 

Over my heart, in the days that are flown, 
No love like mother-love ever has shone; 
No other worship abides and endures,--       
Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours: 
None like a mother can charm away pain 
From the sick soul and the world-weary brain. 
Slumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep;--      
Rock me to sleep, mother,  rock me to sleep! 

Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold, 
Fall on your shoulders again as of old; 
Let it drop over my forehead tonight, 
Shading my faint eyes away from the light; 
For with its sunny-edged shadows once more 
Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore; 
Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;--    
Rock me to sleep, mother,  rock me to sleep! 

Mother, dear mother, the years have been long 
Since I last listened your lullaby song: 
Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem 
Womanhood's years have been only a dream. 
Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace, 
With your light lashes just sweeping my face, 
Never hereafter to wake or to weep;--      
Rock me to sleep, mother,  rock me to sleep!






Alohaoe (Farewell to Thee)
 

Proudly swept the rain by the cliffs 
As on it glided through the trees 
Still following ever the liko 
The Ahihi lehua of the vale. 

      Chorus: 
      Farewell to thee, farewell to thee 
      Thou charming one who dwells in shaded bowers 
      One fond embrace ere I depart 
      Until we meet again. 

Thus sweet memories come back to me 
Bringing fresh remembrance of the past 
Dearest one, yes, thou art mine own 
From thee, true love shall ne'er depart. 

I have seen and watched thy loveliness, 
Thou sweet Rose of Maunawili
And 'tis there the birds oft love to dwell 
And sip the honey from thy lips.






Sanoe
 

Listen, Sanoe 
Dewy lehua bud 
Here I am 
Waiting for your voice. 

The answer comes
I am satisfied 
Softly, sweetheart 
You excite my whole being. 

My body is waiting 
Waiting there in yearning belief 
How are we to fulfill 
The desire of our thoughts? 

Calling to you, my water lily 
Budding for the two of us 
Here close by is a compliment 
The manu comes to deliver. 

The Queen is listening 
The aroma of the scents comes together 
Mixes and rises upward 
So similar, so alike.






Ka Waiapo Lani (Heavenly Showers)
 

As if the flow of the waters
From the triple streams of heavenly showers 
So the sacred Ao of the eighth heavens
Whose flames have scorched the land. 

      Chorus: 
      Should our hearts' love be restored 
      And our rights be ours once more 
      Then will our sacred beloved shoals of Kane 
      Be the firm foundation of the land. 

The heavens expand and bestow 
Her beauteous crownlets free 
Its life to her people for offerings given 
And from loyal hearts ascended prayers. 

Cold words and looks reprove 
Oh, turn not thus away 
Give kindly greetings, words of love 
And a heart which beats within.






Long Island Sound
 

I see it as it looked one afternoon 
In August,-- by a fresh soft breeze o'erblown. 
The swiftness of the tide, the light thereon, 
A far-off sail, white as a crescent moon. 
The shining waters with pale currents strewn, 
The quiet fishing-smacks, the Eastern cove, 
The semi-circle of its dark, green grove. 
The luminous grasses, and the merry sun 
In the grave sky; the sparkle far and wide, 
Laughter of unseen children, cheerful chirp 
Of crickets, and low lisp of rippling tide, 
Light summer clouds fantastical as sleep   
Changing unnoted while I gazed thereon. 
All these fair sounds and sights I made my own.






My Grave
 

If, when I die, I must be buried, let 
No cemetery engulph me -- no lone grot, 
Where the great palpitating world comes not, 
Save when, with heart bowed down and eyelids wet, 
It pays its last sad melancholy debt 
To some outjourneying pilgrim. May my lot 
Be rather to lie in some much-used spot, 
Where human life, with all its noise and fret, 
Throbs on about me. Let the roll of wheels, 
With all earth's sounds of pleasure, commerce, love, 
And rush of hurrying feet surge o'er my head. 
Even in my grave I shall be one who feels 
Close kinship with the pulsing world above; 
And too deep silence would distress me, dead.






A Small Moment
 

I walk into the bakery next door   
To my apartment. They are about   
To pull some sort of toast with cheese   
From the oven.   When I ask:   
What's that smell? I am being   
A poet, I am asking   

What everyone else in the shop   
Wanted to ask, but somehow couldn't;   
I am speaking on behalf of two other   
Customers who wanted to buy the   
Name of it.   I ask the woman   
Behind the counter for a percentage   
Of her sale. Am I flirting?   
Am I happy because the days   
Are longer?   Here's what   

She does: She takes her time   
Choosing the slices.   "I am picking   
Out the good ones, she tells me.   It's    
April 14th.. Spring, with five to ten    
Degrees to go.   Some days, I feel my duty;   
Some days, I love my work.





Marshlands
 

A thin wet sky, that yellows at the rim, 
And meets with sun-lost lip the marsh's brim. 

The pools low lying, dank with moss and mould, 
Glint through their mildews like large cups of gold. 

Among the wild rice in the still lagoon, 
In monotone the lizard shrills his tune. 

The wild goose, homing, seeks a sheltering, 
Where rushes grow, and oozing lichens cling. 

Late cranes with heavy wing, and lazy flight, 
Sail up the silence with the nearing night. 

And like a spirit, swathed in some soft veil, 
Steals twilight and its shadows o'er the swale. 

Hushed lie the sedges, and the vapours creep, 
Thick, grey and humid, while the marshes sleep. 






Joe
 

An Etching
A meadow brown; across the yonder edge 
A zigzag fence is ambling; here a wedge 
Of underbush has cleft its course in twain, 
Till where beyond it staggers up again; 
The long, grey rails stretch in a broken line 
Their ragged length of rough, split forest pine, 
And in their zigzag tottering have reeled 
In drunken efforts to enclose the field, 
Which carries on its breast, September born, 
A patch of rustling, yellow, Indian corn. 
Beyond its shrivelled tassels, perched upon 
The topmost rail, sits Joe, the settler's son, 
A little semi-savage boy of nine. 
Now dozing in the warmth of Nature's wine, 
His face the sun has tampered with, and wrought, 
By heated kisses, mischief, and has brought 
Some vagrant freckles, while from here and there 
A few wild locks of vagabond brown hair 
Escape the old straw hat the sun looks through, 
And blinks to meet his Irish eyes of blue. 
Barefooted, innocent of coat or vest, 
His grey checked shirt unbuttoned at his chest, 
Both hardy hands within their usual nest--   
His breeches pockets -- so, he waits to rest 
His little fingers, somewhat tired and worn, 
That all day long were husking Indian corn. 
His drowsy lids snap at some trivial sound, 
With lazy yawns he slips towards the ground, 
Then with an idle whistle lifts his load 
And shambles home along the country road 
That stretches on fringed out with stumps and weeds, 
And finally unto the backwoods leads, 
Where forests wait with giant trunk and bough 
The axe of pioneer, the settler's plough. 







Fate
 

Two shall be born the whole world wide apart, 
And speak in different tongues, and pay their debts 
In different kinds of coin; and give no heed 
Each to the other's being. And know not 
That each might suit the other to a T, 
If they were but correctly introduced. 
And these, unconsciously, shall bend their steps, 
Escaping Spaniards and defying war, 
Unerringly toward the same trysting-place, 
Albeit they know it not. Until at last 
They enter the same door, and suddenly 
They meet. And ere they've seen each other's face 
They fall into each other's arms, upon 
The Broadway cable car  and this is Fate!






The Poster Girls Defence
 

It was an Artless Poster Girl pinned up against my wall, 
She was tremendous ugly, she was exceeding tall; 
I was gazing at her idly, and I think I must have slept, 
For that poster maiden lifted up her poster voice, and wept. 

She said between her poster sobs, I think it's rather rough 
To be jeered and fleered and flouted, and I've stood it long enough; 
I'm tired of being quoted as a Fright and Fad and Freak, 
And I take this opportunity my poster mind to speak. 

Although my hair is carmine and my nose is edged with blue, 
Although my style is splashy and my shade effects are few, 
Although I'm out of drawing and my back hair is a show, 
Yet I have n't half the whimseys of the maidens that you know. 

I never keep you waiting while I prink before the glass, 
I never talk such twaddle as that little Dawson lass, 
I never paint on china, nor erotic novels write, 
And I never have recited "Curfew must not ring tonight. 

I don't rave over Ibsen, I never, never flirt, 
I never wear a shirt waist with a disconnected skirt; 
I never speak in public on "The Suffrage, or "The Race, 
I never talk while playing whist, or trump my partner's ace.' 

I said: O artless Poster Girl, you're in the right of it, 
You are a joy forever, though a thing of beauty, nit!' 
And from her madder eyebrows to her utmost purple swirl, 
Against all captious critics I'll defend the Poster Girl.






Of Modern Books
 

               (A Pantoum)
Of making many books there is no end, 
   Though myriads have to deep oblivion gone; 
Each day new manuscripts are being penned, 
   And still the ceaseless tide of ink flows on. 

Though myriads have to deep oblivion gone, 
   New volumes daily issue from the press; 
And still the ceaseless tide of ink flows on-- 
   The prospect is disheartening, I confess. 

New volumes daily issue from the press; 
   My pile of unread books I view aghast. 
The prospect is disheartening, I confess; 
   Why will these modern authors write so fast? 

My pile of unread books I view aghast--
   Of course I must keep fairly up to date-- 
Why will these modern authors write so fast? 
   They seem to get ahead of me of late. 

Of course I must keep fairly up to date; 
   The books of special merit I must read; 
They seem to get ahead of me of late, 
   Although I skim them very fast indeed. 

The books of special merit I must read; 
   And then the magazines come round again; 
Although I skim them very fast indeed, 
   I can't get through with more than eight or ten. 

And then the magazines come round again! 
   How can we stem this tide of printer's ink? 
I can't get through with more than eight or ten-- 
   It is appalling when I stop to think. 

How can we stem this tide of printer's ink? 
   Of making many books there is no end. 
It is appalling when I stop to think 
   Each day new manuscripts are being penned!






A Position at the University
 

          
          I think I know what sort of person I am. But then I think, But this stranger will imagine me quite otherwise when he or she hears this or that to my credit, for instance that I have a position at the university: the fact that I have a position at the university will appear to mean that I must be the sort of person who has a position at the university. But then I have to admit, with surprise, that, after all, it is true that I have a position at the university. And if it is true, then perhaps I really am the sort of person you imagine when you hear that a person has a position at the university. But, on the other hand, I know I am not the sort of person I imagine when I hear that a person has a position at the university. Then I see what the problem is: when others describe me this way, they appear to describe me completely, whereas in fact they do not describe me completely, and a complete description of me would include truths that seem quite incompatible with the fact that I have a position at the university. 





The Unruly Child
 

There is a company called Marathon Oil, mother, 
Very far away and very big and, again, very 
Desirable. Who isn't? Back connecting pure dots, 
Fleecy intelligence lapped in explanatory sound 
The faces make difficult. 

Learn the language. 
That beautiful tongue-in-cheek hostage situation: 
My mind, up close, in pjs, and I use it. 
Wanting to fuck an abstraction nine times in a row, 
Continuous melismata, don't stop, don't stop, no name, no picture. 

There is a series of solids, mother, 
Called people, who rise to the transparent obtainable 
Solo windows, mornings, afternoons, 
And there are military operations called 
Operation Patio, Operation Menu. 

It is the individuals who finally get the feel of the tenses. 
So that it may snow, has to snow on the muddy corpse. 
There is a boundary, mother, very far away and very 
Continuous, broken, to interrogate civilians, the self, 
The text, networks of viewers found wanting a new way 
To cook chicken, why not?, to kill while falling asleep. 
There is the one language not called money, and the other not called explosions.

Morning News
 

Spring wafts up the smell of bus exhaust, of bread   
and fried potatoes, tips green on the branches, 
repeats old news: arrogance, ignorance, war. 
A cinder-block wall shared by two houses 
is new rubble. On one side was a kitchen 
sink and a cupboard, on the other was 
a bed, a bookshelf, three framed photographs. 

Glass is shattered across the photographs; 
two half-circles of hardened pocket bread 
sit on the cupboard. There provisionally was 
shelter, a plastic truck under the branches 
of a fig tree. A knife flashed in the kitchen, 
merely dicing garlic. Engines of war 
move inexorably toward certain houses 

while citizens sit safe in other houses 
reading the newspaper, whose photographs 
make sanitized excuses for the war. 
There are innumerable kinds of bread 
brought up from bakeries, baked in the kitchen: 
the date, the latitude, tell which one was 
dropped by a child beneath the bloodied branches. 

The uncontrolled and multifurcate branches 
of possibility infiltrate houses' 
walls, windowframes, ceilings. Where there was 
a tower, a town: ash and burnt wires, a graph 
on a distant computer screen. Elsewhere, a kitchen 
table's setting gapes, where children bred 
to branch into new lives were culled for war. 

Who wore this starched smocked cotton dress? Who wore 
this jersey blazoned for the local branch 
of the district soccer team? Who left this black bread 
and this flat gold bread in their abandoned houses? 
Whose father begged for mercy in the kitchen? 
Whose memory will frame the photograph 
and use the memory for what it was 

never meant for by this girl, that old man, who was 
caught on a ball field, near a window: war, 
exhorted through the grief a photograph 
revives. (Or was the team a covert branch 
of a banned group; were maps drawn in the kitchen, 
a bomb thrust in a hollowed loaf of bread?) 
What did the old men pray for in their houses 

of prayer, the teachers teach in schoolhouses 
between blackouts and blasts, when each word was 
flensed by new censure, books exchanged for bread, 
both hostage to the happenstance of war? 
Sometimes the only schoolroom is a kitchen. 
Outside the window, black strokes on a graph 
of broken glass, birds line up on bare branches. 

"This letter curves, this one spreads its branches 
like friends holding hands outside their houses. 
Was the lesson stopped by gunfire? Was 
there panic, silence? Does a torn photograph 
still gather children in the teacher's kitchen? 
Are they there meticulously learning war- 
time lessons with the signs for house, book, bread?





Assault to Abjury
 

Rain commenced, and wind did. 

A crippled ship slid ashore. 

Our swimmer's limbs went heavy. 

The sand had been flattened. 

The primary dune, the secondary dune, both leveled. 

The maritime forest, extracted. 

Every yard of the shore was shocked with jellyfish. 

The blue pillow of the man o' war empty in the afterlight. 

The threads of the jellyfish, spent. 

Disaster weirdly neatened the beach. 

We cultivated the debris field. 

Castaway trash, our treasure. 

Jewel box, spoon ring, sack of rock candy. 

A bicycle exoskeleton without wheels, grasshopper green. 

Our dead ten speed. 

We rested in red mangrove and sheltered in sheets. 

Our bruises blushed backwards, our blisters did. 

is it true is it true 

God help us we tried to stay shattered but we just got better. 

We grew adept, we caught the fish as they fled. 

We skinned the fish, our knife clicked like an edict. 

We were harmed, and then we healed.





A Route of Evanescence, (1489)
 

A Route of Evanescence, 
With a revolving Wheel  
A Resonance of Emerald 
A Rush of Cochineal  
And every Blossom on the Bush 
Adjusts it's tumbled Head  
The Mail from Tunis  probably, 
An easy Morning's Ride 





Fame is a fickle food (1702)
 

Fame is a fickle food 
Upon a shifting plate 
Whose table once a 
Guest but not 
The second time is set 
Whose crumbs the crows inspect 
And with ironic caw 
Flap past it to the 
Farmer's corn 
Men eat of it and die





Before I got my eye put out  (336)
 

Before I got my eye put out  
I liked as well to see 
As other creatures, that have eyes  
And know no other way  

But were it told to me, Today, 
That I might have the Sky 
For mine, I tell you that my Heart 
Would split, for size of me  

The Meadows  mine  
The Mountains  mine  
All Forests  Stintless stars  
As much of noon, as I could take  
Between my finite eyes  

The Motions of the Dipping Birds  
The Morning's Amber Road  
For mine  to look at when I liked, 
The news would strike me dead  

So safer  guess  with just my soul 
Opon the window pane 
Where other creatures put their eyes  
Incautious  of the Sun 





Come slowly  Eden! (205)
 

Come slowly  Eden! 
Lips unused to Thee  
Bashful  sip thy Jessamines  
As the fainting Bee  

Reaching late his flower, 
Round her chamber hums  
Counts his nectars  
Enters  and is lost in Balms. 







I know that He exists. (365)
 

I know that He exists. 
Somewhere  in silence  
He has hid his rare life 
From our gross eyes. 

'Tis an instant's play  
'Tis a fond Ambush  
Just to make Bliss 
Earn her own surprise! 

But  should the play 
Prove piercing earnest  
Should the glee  glaze  
In Death's  stiff  stare  

Would not the fun 
Look too expensive! 
Would not the jest  
Have crawled too far!





Some keep the Sabbath going to Church  (236)
 

Some keep the Sabbath going to Church  
I keep it, staying at Home  
With a Bobolink for a Chorister  
And an Orchard, for a Dome  

Some keep the Sabbath in Surplice  
I, just wear my Wings  
And instead of tolling the Bell, for Church, 
Our little Sexton  sings. 

God preaches, a noted Clergyman  
And the sermon is never long, 
So instead of getting to Heaven, at last  
I'm going, all along.





Fame is a bee. (1788)
 

Fame is a bee. 
It has a song-- 
It has a sting-- 
Ah, too, it has a wing.





The cars
 

          
          Sprinting across the freeway just ahead of them having set his left foot down   directly onto the pavement from the ledge of the cement divide and edging his other leg forward deliberately--caught the way sports pages show an athlete with muscles condensed in the effort of crossing through a particular space--and then she sees the cars coming towards him giving off that early morning shine across their hoods almost colorless but precipitous in the four-lane parallel rush of metal and cannot tell if any driver straining into the distance further ahead has seen him or possibly has caught that glint off the long black flashlight he appears to carry with its up-beam turned on full and faintly visible due to the angle of early sun falling over the midwestern plains fanning out in every direction away from the   sudden view of the airport hub's acclaimed architectural design.  She sees the brief alignment of his body methodically finding its way across the freeway lanes blue baseball cap fit snugly over his head to just above the hairline where now dusky skin of his neck breaks into the picture.  He's made it halfway, she thinks, but she can't stop the cars rushing towards him even as he scans with concentration the worn lanes for the thing he's lost as if he's walking through the dark and shining his flashlight wherever the object might have landed, his right knee   still lifting purposefully upward and forward.                                                                                                       -- for C.W.
        




Praise Song for the Day
 

A Poem for Barack Obama's Presidential Inauguration
Each day we go about our business, 
walking past each other, catching each other's 
eyes or not, about to speak or speaking. 

All about us is noise. All about us is 
noise and bramble, thorn and din, each 
one of our ancestors on our tongues. 

Someone is stitching up a hem, darning 
a hole in a uniform, patching a tire, 
repairing the things in need of repair. 

Someone is trying to make music somewhere, 
with a pair of wooden spoons on an oil drum, 
with cello, boom box, harmonica, voice. 

A woman and her son wait for the bus. 
A farmer considers the changing sky. 
A teacher says, Take out your pencils. Begin. 

We encounter each other in words, words 
spiny or smooth, whispered or declaimed, 
words to consider, reconsider. 

We cross dirt roads and highways that mark 
the will of some one and then others, who said 
I need to see what's on the other side. 

I know there's something better down the road. 
We need to find a place where we are safe. 
We walk into that which we cannot yet see. 

Say it plain: that many have died for this day. 
Sing the names of the dead who brought us here, 
who laid the train tracks, raised the bridges, 

picked the cotton and the lettuce, built 
brick by brick the glittering edifices 
they would then keep clean and work inside of. 

Praise song for struggle, praise song for the day. 
Praise song for every hand-lettered sign, 
the figuring-it-out at kitchen tables. 

Some live by love thy neighbor as thyself, 
others by first do no harm or take no more 
than you need. What if the mightiest word is love? 

Love beyond marital, filial, national, 
love that casts a widening pool of light, 
love with no need to pre-empt grievance. 

In today's sharp sparkle, this winter air, 
any thing can be made, any sentence begun. 
On the brink, on the brim, on the cusp, 

praise song for walking forward in that light.





Not Ideas About the Thing but the Thing Itself
 

At the earliest ending of winter, 
In March, a scrawny cry from outside 
Seemed like a sound in his mind. 

He knew that he heard it, 
A bird's cry at daylight or before, 
In the early March wind 

The sun was rising at six, 
No longer a battered panache above snow . . . 
It would have been outside. 

It was not from the vast ventriloquism 
Of sleep's faded papier mch . . . 
The sun was coming from outside. 

That scrawny cry--it was 
A chorister whose c preceded the choir. 
It was part of the colossal sun, 

Surrounded by its choral rings, 
Still far away. It was like 
A new knowledge of reality.





Aeneid, II, 692 - end
 

As he spoke we could hear, ever more loudly, the noise   
Of the burning fires; the flood of flames was coming   
Nearer and nearer. "My father, let me take you   
Upon my shoulders and carry you with me.   
The burden will be easy. Whatever happens,   
You and I will experience it together,   
Peril or safety, whichever it will be.   
Little Ilus will come along beside me.   
My wife will follow behind us. And you, my servants,   
Listen to what I say: just as you leave   
The limits of the city there is a mound,   
And the vestiges of a deserted temple of Ceres,   
And a cypress tree that has been preserved alive   
For many years by the piety of our fathers.   
We will all meet there, though perhaps by different ways   
And, Father, you must carry in your arms   
The holy images of our household gods;   
I, coming so late from the fighting and the carnage   
Cannot presume to touch them until I have washed   
Myself in running water. Thus I spoke.   

I take up the tawny pelt of a lion and   
Cover my neck and my broad shoulders with it,   
And bowing down, I accept the weight of my father;   
Ilus puts his hand in mine and goes   
Along beside me, trying to match my steps   
As best he can, trying his best to keep up.   
My wife follows behind us, a little way back.   
So we all set out together, making our way   
Among the shadows, and I, who only just   
A little while ago had faced, undaunted,   
Showers of arrows and swarms of enemy Greeks,   
Am frightened by every slightest change in the air   
And startled by every slightest sound I hear,   
Fearful for whom I walk with and whom I carry. 
And just as I had almost come to the gates   
And thought that I had almost gotten us free,   
I thought I heard the sound of many feet,   
And my father, peering intently into the shadows,   
Cries out to me, "Get away, get away, my son,   
My son, they are coming! I see their shining shields,   
I see the glow of their weapons in the dark!   
I am alarmed, and I don't know what happened   
But some power hostile to me distracts my wits   
And I am confused, and I lead us away by ways   
That I don't know, and off the familiar streets   
That together we are following, and so,   
O God! some fate has taken away my wife,   
Cresa, my wife, away from me. What happened?   
Did she wander from the way that we were going?   
Did she fall back, having to rest some place   
Back there, and so we left her? I did not know.   
I never saw her again, and as we went,   
I never turned to look behind, and never   
Thought of her until we reached the mound   
And Ceres' ancient place. When all of us,   
At last, had gotten there, we all were there,   
But she had vanished and she wasn't there.   
Gone from her people, gone from her child, and her husband.   

What men or gods in my frenzy did I not   
Cry out against? What worse sight had I seen?   
I left Ascanius and Anchises and   
The household gods in the care of my companions   
And I found a secluded place deep in a valley   
For them to hide, and I myself took up   
My shining weapons and sought the city again,   
Determined, no matter what, to look for my   
Cresa everywhere in Troy. I find   
My way along the walls and to, and through,   
The shadowed gate I'd left the city by;   
Carefully, step by unseen step, in the dark,   
Backwards the way I came I make my way;   
Everywhere as I go fills me with terror;   
The very silence around me fills me with terror.   
I make my way to my home in case, in case,   
She's gone back there. The Greeks had invaded the house   
And set it on fire, and through the house the fire   
Rolled up on the surge of the wind to the very roof,   
And the flames tower high above the burning house   
And the heat of the burning pours up into the sky.   
And so I go on, and once again I see   
The palace of Priam, and the citadel,   
And in the empty courtyard of Juno's shrine   
There's Phoenix and dire Ulysses, guarding the treasures   
Taken from everywhere from the shrines that the Greeks   
Had set fire to; the golden bowls, the holy   
Altar-tables, the stolen holy vestments;   
Boys and trembling matrons stand around . . .   
I wander in the streets, in my desperation   
Calling out her name, Cresa, Cresa,   
Calling Cresa, over and over again.   
And as I went among the ruined buildings   
And through the streets of the ruined city, lo,   
Suddenly there rose before my eyes   
The strangely magnified image of my wife.   
I was stupefied; my hair stood on end; my voice   
Got caught in my throat. Then she spoke to me and said   
Words that altered everything for me:   
"Beloved husband, what use is it for you   
To persist in this insanity of grief.   
What has happened here has happened not without   
The will of the gods. The high lord of Olympus   
Does not permit Cresa to go with you   
To be with you on your journey where you are going. 
Long exile will be yours, ploughing across   
Vast seas until you come to Hesperia,   
Where Lydian Tiber gently flows between   
Rich husbanded fields and where you will be happy,   
A king, and wedded to a royal wife.   
Give up your weeping now for your Cresa;   
I, a Dardan woman and the spouse   
Of divine Venus's son, will never see   
The scornful households of the Myrmidons   
Or the Dolopians, and never have to be   
A scullion slave in service to some Greek matron.   
The Mighty Mother keeps me on these shores.   
Farewell and may your care protect and cherish   
Your child and mine. And having spoken thus,   
The image of her receded into air,   
Leaving me weeping, with so much still to say.   
Three times I tried to embrace her and to hold her;   
Three times the image, clasped in vain, escaped   
As if it were a breeze or on the wings   
Of a vanishing dream.   
                               And so, the night being over,   
I returned to my companions where they were.   
When I got there I was amazed to see   
How many others, women and men, had come,   
Wretched survivors of the fall of the city,   
To join us in the exile and the journey,   
A heartbreaking company, come from everywhere,   
Ready in their hearts and with their fortunes,   
To follow me wherever I was going.   
And now the morning star was rising over   
The highest ridges of Ida, bringing in   
The day that was beginning; the Danaans held   
The city behind the gates that they had locked.   
There was no hope of further help. And so   
I acknowledged this, and taking up the burden   
Of my father once again, I sought the hills.





to where
 

Wearing a tawny lion pelt upon   
My spindly shoulders I carry both of them,   
My father and my mother, into the darkness,   
My father hoarsely singing, "They are there!   
--The glimmer of something that is glimmering there--   
"I see the glow of weapons in the shadows!   
Through which with my purblind eyes I think I see   
Something in the darkness waiting there.   
Above me in the dark my mother's voice   
Calls down to me, "Who's there? Who is it there?   
Step after step together we make our way,   
In the darkness of my memory of our house.





Scrim
 

I sit here in a shelter behind the words   
Of what I'm writing, looking out as if   
Through a dim curtain of rain, that keeps me in here.   

The words are like a scrim upon a page,   
Obscuring what might be there beyond the scrim.   
I can dimly see there's something or someone there.   

But I can't tell if it's God, or one of his angels,   
Or the past, or future, or who it is I love,   
My mother or father lost, or my lost sister,   

Or my wife lost when I was too late to get there,   
I only know that there's something, or somebody, there.   
Tell me your name. How was it that I knew you?





I Had A Tapeworm
 

I had a tapeworm, and imagined it   
flat--paper-flat--like a strip of caps,   
pallid red, a quarter-inch wide   
with bulbous BB bullfrog eyes   
peeking out of my asshole as I lolled   
in a crowded fetid basement swimming pool   
(the kind that used to be in inner-city Ys:   
windowless; steamy; concrete-block moldings   
chalky-cracked), and you whom I've neither   
seen nor heard of for thirty years   
were saying I'd give everyone in the pool   
my tapeworm, which you knew had eaten   
my insides and now had threaded through   
both my intestines and was trying to get out.   
Where were we? Everyone was old, old--   
gray, infirm; flaccid and thin   
or fat and bald, all ill flesh drooping--   
the women in rubber-flowered bathing caps   
and black one-piece suits as if we were all   
on an outing from a nursing home.   
I couldn't see myself to see how old I was,   
but you were thirty, at the peak of your beauty,   
as when you knelt naked on the motel room bed   
brushing out your thick dark waist-length hair   
after cheating on the lover you were cheating   
on your husband with, who was at that moment   
waiting for you in another motel room   
from which you had slipped to meet me secretly:   
a secret inside a secret, buried, encased,   
as if if we dug deep enough into it   
we'd find what we were trying   
to get or stop.





He was touched or he touched or
 

He was touched or he touched or   
she did and was, or they were   
and would. Or the room could, its   
three doors, two windows or   

the house on a slant touching,   
touched by the drift down street, cars   
pressing quick or slowing. All along   
the town touched a river, the river   

the filth falling through it. What was clean--   
a source pure as rumor--a shore   
touching lake touched by wind above,   
and below, a spring. All touch blindly 

further water. That blue touching   
blacker regions in the sea so weirdly   
solitary, each to under, to every   
sideways past deeper, where nowhere.





Letter Composed During a Lull in the Fighting
 

I tell her I love her like not killing   
or ten minutes of sleep   
beneath the low rooftop wall   
on which my rifle rests.   

I tell her in a letter that will stink,   
when she opens it,   
of bolt oil and burned powder   
and the things it says.   

I tell her how Pvt. Bartle says, offhand,   
that war is just us   
making little pieces of metal   
pass through each other.





More Lying Loving Facts, You Sort Em Out
 

For a long time the Spanish from Spain   
Who came here became slightly insane   
In a special way and just a little.   
You can try this yourself.   
Walk farther than you can into the forest in New York   
So it's a toss-up whether or not you know the way back.   
For you there's going to be a smidge of confusion, a glow of fear   
That smells like burning rye toast,   
And the illusion that you are the only person alive   
On the earth. You will probably have the second illusion   
That no one likes you, which doesn't jibe with the first illusion   
Of no other people. This was about the extent of it, for the Spanish,   
They felt all that just a few hours a week, but every week at home,   
Living in, say, small San Francisco,   
Which made thinking slow and hard at these times,   
But if you try this yourself in the deep woods   
You'll see you can still think enough   
And you'll remember your way back to the loving arms   
Of your wife, husband, or mother, in Rochester. (Yes,   
You could try it as a child, but please don't.)   
The Spanish had a purpose to walk east inland to the Sierras, the gold.   
The Indians said there were five hills and two mountains   
Entirely of gold and you had to wear ferns dangling before your eyes   
Like sunglasses when you got near the mountains.   
The hills, they said, were not so bright.   
The Spanish thought this was bullshit   
But were having trouble with the coast (where   
They truly believed the gold was) which was that boats   
Could not travel north and south even as fast as people walking   
Because the Pacific coast was opposing currents (you made   
Half a mile an hour in the water with biggest sail).   
An expedition of thirty Spaniards from Spain (living   
In small San Francisco) walked east inland toward what's now Mariposa.   
It means butterfly. In that place, the shivering feathery 
Insects rose from the ground and blacked out the sun.   
The sky had no room for more butterflies so the leftovers attached to the trees,   
Making the trees appear like ragged trees.   
Look up the other way, the explorers said to each other, but   
That way, when they did, was no blue sky but darkness of orange insects   
That did not fly in clouds but were the sky,   
So any forward motion by the thirty men seemed, not seemed   
Did make the sky covered each inch   
With the thin trembling insects, brown or green or orange,   
But as a whole a black ceiling with little light between them and the men,   
Who thought slow and hard but did think, and so returned   
To small San Francisco where no one believed them but understood   
The illusion because when they asked the thirty men   
What such an encounter with butterflies felt like, the men described   
Feeling the way all the colonists and explorers and priests and women   
Felt a few hours each week at home--   
Fear making the olfactory illusion of burning rye toast hand   
In hand with the illusion of being the only one   
And the simultaneous but contradictory illusion   
That no one likes you. How could everybody hate you   
If there was no everybody? Or even anybody.   
Well there was a way to fix this   
And we use it now around here (I   
Mean in New York and California and Nevada and Hawaii,   
Not just in my house) which is to wrap our loving arms   
Around each other. It works very well   
And I know you've tried it.   
The Spanish from Spain brought virtuous women   
Over for that purpose only (you don't think the virtuous babes looked   
For gold, did you?) and it worked very well   
Except the women were worse, I mean much worse, 
Not just specially a little insane and needed   
The loving arms much more than the men.   
They needed longer sessions and more sessions.   
What's more, if the expedition of thirty butterfly   
Illusionists had gone six miles further,   
They would have seen silver sticking out of the ground   
Like glass after a four-car accident on a street in Rochester.   
But for many decades the promise of the waiting loving arms,   
Versus the unacceptable illusion of the butterflies   
Forming the entire black sky, kept them near the coasts.   
When you put down this book, you could decide   
For yourself if it is true that wrapping loving arms around   
Somebody is as temporarily powerful as I've made it   
Out to be or is possibly permanently powerful or is an illusion   
Like the massed feathery insects which were absolute.





Weaponry
 

I used an arrow to kill the spider.   
I used a steamroller to flatten the worm.   

For the ants I called in an air strike.   
Bee that found its way in through the screen:   

blowtorch.   
The mammals were easier--   

a bucket of water for submerging the cat,   
a poisoned word thrown to the dog.   

For love, only a kitchen match. That   
and a stove leaking gas   

and waiting until the dinner   
was good and burned.





English Sonnet
 

London returns in damp, fragmented flurries   
when I should be doing something else. A scrap   
of song, a pink scarf, and I'm back to curries   
and pub food, long, wet walks without a map,   
bouts of bronchitis, a case of the flu,   
my halfhearted studies, and brooding thoughts   
and scanning faces in every bar for you.   
Those months come down to moments or small plots,   
like the bum on the Tube, enraged that no one spoke,   
who raved and spat, the whole car thick with dread,   
only to ask, won't someone tell a joke?   
and this mouse of a woman offered, What's big and red   
and sits in the corner?    
                            A naughty bus. 
Not funny, I know. But neither's the story of us.





Raz el Hanout
 

A recipe for lamb tagine   
demands a mysterious   
ingredient: raz el hanout.   
Animal, vegetable, compound   

of kings like myrrh? I decide   
not to look it up, to wait and   
see. At first it is everything   
we seek but can't express.   

Then it reverses: everything   
thrust upon us--think fast!--   
by the universe, like the leg   
my friend Tom caught when   

a cyclist got clipped by a car,   
the driver stinking drunk   
at 9:00 AM. Severed above   
the knee, the leg flung itself   

into the air, a javelin. Tom,   
always quick, reached up and   
caught it. But the story has   
a twist. After the cyclist died   

in an ambulance, the widow   
inexplicably came on to Tom.   
Not that Tom is unattractive.   
Indeed he is the sort of man   

I'd throw myself at if I were   
a leg. It's hard to imagine   
the sex that Tom and this   
woman would have had 

there in the hotel room   
with the blackout curtains   
pulled. I've never had sex   
with Tom myself, but if I had   

been that leg or that woman   
I might have whispered,   
"What fine reflexes you   
have, Sir! "Sir, say something   

tender! "Cradle me against   
the guttural gasp from your   
solar plexus. "Oh, Sir, I   
sense the tip of bone   

on skin, a surge of dj vu.   
"I am coming, I am about   
to come, your shuddering   
lover, your raz el hanout.





The Winds Measure
 

The length of the wind runs from mid-May to murder.   
The length of the wind runs from January through joy.   
The wind runs as long as the right hand's first finger   
points to the sun after thunder.   
The wind gallops prayerward   
like a horse held in the palm of a rock,   
no taller than a knee bent for the sake of singing.   
The wind weighs more than the fossilized horse and stretches from fingernail to praise.   
The length of the wind runs from mid-May to mercy, January through justice.   
Unto the broken, dwelling in a broken, promised land, the wind drops a hammer   
and some are warmed and some are chilled and some laugh and some die.   
Silently through the nuclear physicist, the wind wicks   
loud as paper-scraps trailing in the wind's wake,   
igniting an empiricist, fragrant through tallow.   
The wind strikes the wind like rice in a paddy.   
The wind scatters petals like blossoms of napalm.   
The wind snaps the backs of malnourished conquistadors bowed down to gold.   
It is the wind who estimates poverty in moments by the method of moments,   
who assesses want in units of amass.   
It is the wind who shakes America by the ovaries,   
runs the length of revolution, all the calories in a dollar.   
The length of the wind runts from mid-March to hunger.   
The length of the wind grunts from Saturday through sorrow.   
The wind flutters nothing but orgasms and afterplay.   
The wind numbers seminarians more numinous than semen.   
The wind is a mote on the wind.   
The wind is the dust that measures time in footsteps.   
The wind is the word in the throat of the dust.   
The length of the wind runs from midwife to marvel. 
The wind ribbons out within mid-May and mourning and dust   
is the voice the wind whickers glory, the wind whickers grief.





Winged Purposes
 

Fly from me does all I would have stay,   
the blossoms did not stay, stayed not the frost   
in the yellow grass. Every leash snapped,   
every contract void, and flying in the crows   
lingers but a moment in the graveyard oaks   
yet inside me it never stops so I can't tell   
who is chasing, who chased, I can sleep   
into afternoon and still wake soaring.   
So out come the bats, down spiral swifts   
into the chimneys, Hey, I'm real, say the dream-   
figments then are gone like breath-prints   
on a window, handwriting in snow. Whatever   
I hold however flies apart, the children skip   
into the park come out middle-aged   
with children of their own. Your laugh   
over the phone, will it ever answer me again?   
Too much flying, photons perforating us,   
voices hurtling into outer space, Whitman   
out past Neptune, Dickinson retreating   
yet getting brighter. Remember running   
barefoot across hot sand into the sea's   
hovering, remember my hand as we darted   
against the holiday Broadway throng,   
catching your train just as it was leaving?   
Hey, it's real, your face like a comet,   
horses coming from the field for morning   
oats, insects hitting a screen, the message   
nearly impossible to read, obscured by light   
because carried by Mercury: I love you,   
I'm coming. Sure, what fluttered is now gone,   
maybe a smudge left, maybe a delicate under-   
feather only then that too, yes, rained away.   
And when the flying is flown and the heart's   
a useless sliver in a glacier and the gown   
hangs still as meat in a locker and eyesight 
is dashed-down glass and the mouth rust-   
stoppered, will some twinge still pass between us,   
still some fledgling pledge?





The Bees
 

One day the bees start wandering off, no one knows why.   
First one doesn't come back, and then another and another,   
until those who are supposed to stay and guard the hive, those   
who are making the royal jelly and feeding it to the queen,   
those who form different parts of the great brain, must   
put down what it is they are doing and go off in search--   
having no choice, not if the hive is going to survive,   
and where do they go, each one vanishing, never to be seen   
again, off wandering in the wilderness, having forgotten   
how, forgotten what it was they were after, what it was   
that gave meaning, having known it at one time, now   
a veil drawn. Is it that each one is a cell, a brain cell,   
and now they're failing one by one, plaque to Alzheimer's,   
or the way the cells in the esophagus will begin to mimic   
the stomach if the acid is too intense, if you're sleeping   
and the valve won't close, a lifetime of eating and drinking   
the wrong things, those cells compensating, trying   
their best, but opening the door to those other cells,   
the wild ones, the ones that call those bees, out there,   
somewhere, lost, having nowhere to return at night,   
their search for nectar fruitful, their small saddlebags full,   
but no one to go home to, no home, no memory of home,   
it's as if they'd stumbled into some alternate world,   
one looking like ours but just a glass width different,   
just a fraction of sunlight different, the patient waking up,   
finding herself wandering, someone leading her back   
to bed, but there is no bed. Confusion of the hive,   
they call it, and the hive dies, each bee goes down,   
each light goes out, one by one, blinking out all over town,   
seen from a great height as the night ages, darkens,   
as you're parked in your car with your own true love,   
until it's just you two and the stars, until it's just you.





Connubial
 

Because with alarming accuracy   
she'd been identifying patterns   
I was unaware of--this tic, that   
tendency, like the way I've mastered   
the language of intimacy   
in order to conceal how I felt--   

I knew I was in danger   
of being terribly understood.





To a Ring I Lost Planting Bulbs
 

You give me the slip between garlic and lilies,   
as if this is what comes of my unprotected   
loves, of my hands in the sweet earth,   
their willful miscegenation of the border bed   
where you're tucked in deep with tulips, too,   
like just one more of their heart-freaks:   
a fluke diamondine flake, a thin vein gone gold.   
Being mine, you'll grow up a girdled tree, girt   
with a ringed-around root, nothing like   
the fruitful vine of good wives--one of which   
I'll never be so, my not-love-knot, you may   
as well come up instead like a kiss:   
the one wind gives to rouse the Japanese maple,   
October's aerialist, its bright aureole   
in the last late sun a red mouth, opening.





The Lawn Mower
 

When we finally flip it over   
the fireflies are out. The neighbor boy   
has had his stitches in so I can finally admit   
I think it is all fantastic: the suck   
of the spark plug undone, the stuck blade   
bent into the guard, and the sound   
of the hammer's head reshaping the metal.   
In this our suburban Eden we've only   
a teenage Adam too dreamy to manage   
his motorized scythe and silly Eve leaving   
her coffee cups and plastic plant pots   
behind in the grass. Though it's a long way   
from a fall, this spring's first disaster,   
I did like the thin thread of red   
on his upper lip, and I like my mower   
turned over among the glowworms,   
a monstrous dandelion as unnatural as we   
are, out in a garden, with our untidy   
golds and our dangerous sharps.





Vanity Flare
 

Don't get me wrong: I know   
that knowledge is power,   
that mystery's water,   
that hunger makes   
a gargantuan   
lover,   
and yes, I've drunk   
of the river Lethe,   
from the breath of the Celts,   
from the echo of   
the bugling elk,   

and yet,   

alas,   
here I be,   
small and twee,   
all liquored up   
on song and love,   
hard as rails   
and light as air,   
expecting the heavens   
to throw down a flare,   
to send in the clowns,   
to burn a bush,   
strike up the sea,   
anything   

that might mean   
those cloudy bastards   
have noticed me.

How to Continue
 

Oh there once was a woman 
and she kept a shop 
selling trinkets to tourists 
not far from a dock 
who came to see what life could be 
far back on the island. 

And it was always a party there 
always different but very nice 
New friends to give you advice 
or fall in love with you which is nice 
and each grew so perfectly from the other 
it was a marvel of poetry 
and irony 

And in this unsafe quarter 
much was scary and dirty 
but no one seemed to mind 
very much 
the parties went on from house to house 
There were friends and lovers galore 
all around the store 
There was moonshine in winter 
and starshine in summer 
and everybody was happy to have discovered 
what they discovered 

And then one day the ship sailed away 
There were no more dreamers just sleepers 
in heavy attitudes on the dock 
moving as if they knew how 
among the trinkets and the souvenirs 
the random shops of modern furniture 
and a gale came and said 
it is time to take all of you away 
from the tops of the trees to the little houses 
on little paths so startled 

And when it became time to go 
they none of them would leave without the other 
for they said we are all one here 
and if one of us goes the other will not go 
and the wind whispered it to the stars 
the people all got up to go 
and looked back on love





Sleepers Awake
 

Cervantes was asleep when he wrote Don Quixote. 
Joyce slept during the Wandering Rocks section of Ulysses. 
Homer nodded and occasionally slept during the greater part of the Iliad; he was awake however when he wrote the Odyssey. 
Proust snored his way through The Captive, as have legions of his readers after him. 
Melville was asleep at the wheel for much of Moby-Dick. 
Fitzgerald slept through Tender Is the Night, which is perhaps not so surprising, 
but the fact that Mann slumbered on the very slopes of The Magic Mountain is quite extraordinary--that he wrote it, even more so.   
Kafka, of course, never slept, even while not writing or on bank holidays. 
No one knows too much about George Eliot's writing habits--my guess is she would sleep a few minutes, wake up and write something, then pop back to sleep again. 
Lew Wallace's forty winks came, incredibly, during the chariot race in Ben-Hur. 
Emily Dickinson slept on her cold, narrow bed in Amherst. 
When she awoke there would be a new poem inscribed by Jack Frost on the windowpane; outside, glass foliage chimed. 
Good old Walt snored as he wrote and, like so many of us, insisted he didn't. 
Maugham snored on the Riviera. 
Agatha Christie slept daintily, as a woman sleeps, which is why her novels are like tea sandwiches--artistic, for the most part. 
I sleep when I cannot avoid it; my writing and sleeping are constantly improving. 

I have other things to say, but shall not detain you much. 
Never go out in a boat with an author--they cannot tell when they are over water. 
Birds make poor role models. 
A philosopher should be shown the door, but don't, under any circumstances, try it. 
Slaves make good servants. 
Brushing the teeth may not always improve the appearance. 
Store clean rags in old pillow cases. 
Feed a dog only when he barks. 
Flush tea leaves down the toilet, coffee grounds down the sink. 
Beware of anonymous letters--you may have written them, in a wordless implosion of sleep.





This Room
 

The room I entered was a dream of this room. 
Surely all those feet on the sofa were mine. 
The oval portrait 
of a dog was me at an early age. 
Something shimmers, something is hushed up. 

We had macaroni for lunch every day 
except Sunday, when a small quail was induced 
to be served to us. Why do I tell you these things? 
You are not even here.





If You Said You Would Come With Me
 

          
          In town it was very urban but in the country cows were covering the hills. The clouds were near and very moist. I was walking along the pavement with Anna, enjoying the scattered scenery. Suddenly a sound like a deep bell came from behind us. We both turned to look. "It's the words you spoke in the past, coming back to haunt you, Anna explained. "They always do, you know.        Indeed I did. Many times this deep bell-like tone had intruded itself on my thoughts, scrambling them at first, then rearranging them in apple-pie order. "Two crows, the voice seemed to say, "were sitting on a sundial in the God-given sunlight. Then one flew away.       "Yes . . . and then? I wanted to ask, but I kept silent. We turned into a courtyard and walked up several flights of stairs to the roof, where a party was in progress. "This is my friend Hans, Anna said by way of introduction. No one paid much attention and several guests moved away to the balustrade to admire the view of orchards and vineyards, approaching their autumn glory. One of the women however came to greet us in a friendly manner. I was wondering if this was a "harvest home, a phrase I had often heard but never understood.       "Welcome to my home . . . well, to our home, the woman said gaily. "As you can see, the grapes are being harvested. It seemed she could read my mind. "They say this year's vintage will be a mediocre one, but the sight is lovely, nonetheless. Don't you agree, Mr. . . .       "Hans, I replied curtly. The prospect was indeed a lovely one, but I wanted to leave. Making some excuse I guided Anna by the elbow toward the stairs and we left.       "That wasn't polite of you, she said dryly.       "Honey, I've had enough of people who can read your mind. When I want it done I'll go to a mind reader.       "I happen to be one and I can tell you what you're thinking is false. Listen to what the big bell says: We are all strangers on our own turf, in our own time.' You should have paid attention. Now adjustments will have to be made.

The Cherry Tree
 

Out of the nursery and into the garden   
where it rooted and survived its first hard winter,   
then a few years of freedom while it blossomed,   
put out its first tentative branches, withstood   
the insects and the poisons for insects,   
developed strange ideas about its height   
and suffered the pruning of its quirks and clutters,   
its self-indulgent thrusts   
and the infighting of stems at cross purposes   
year after year.  Each April it forgot   
why it couldn't do what it had to do,   
and always after blossoms, fruit, and leaf-fall,   
was shown once more what simply couldn't happen.   

Its oldest branches now, the survivors carved   
by knife blades, rain, and wind, are sending shoots   
straight up, blood red, into the light again.





Acts of Vexation
 

The only thing under the sun 
I can run to 
is Ecclesiastes 

for there is nothing gathered into one self 
that can be kept 

Want is humbled by death 
as every purpose manifests it 

Feeling this all my life 
a piercing fright 
gathers in the stomach's pit 

This is it and this is not the end 
of the road 

for even despair is a kind of goad 
to wisdom 

The beauty of the world 
over one's own anguish 

The day that I lost all feeling 

I was both a Fool and a Goddess





The Idea
 

for Nolan Miller
For us, too, there was a wish to possess 
Something beyond the world we knew, beyond ourselves, 
Beyond our power to imagine, something nevertheless 
In which we might see ourselves; and this desire 
Came always in passing, in waning light, and in such cold 
That ice on the valley's lakes cracked and rolled, 
And blowing snow covered what earth we saw, 
And scenes from the past, when they surfaced again, 
Looked not as they had, but ghostly and white 
Among false curves and hidden erasures; 
And never once did we feel we were close 
Until the night wind said, "Why do this, 
Especially now? Go back to the place you belong; 
And there appeared , with its windows glowing, small, 
In the distance, in the frozen reaches, a cabin; 
And we stood before it, amazed at its being there, 
And would have gone forward and opened the door, 
And stepped into the glow and warmed ourselves there, 
But that it was ours by not being ours, 
And should remain empty. That was the idea. 






Orpheus Alone
 

It was an adventure much could be made of: a walk
On the shores of the darkest known river,
Among the hooded, shoving crowds, by steaming rocks
And rows of ruined huts half buried in the muck;
Then to the great court with its marble yard
Whose emptiness gave him the creeps, and to sit there
In the sunken silence of the place and speak
Of what he had lost, what he still possessed of his loss,
And, then, pulling out all the stops, describing her eyes,
Her forehead where the golden light of evening spread,
The curve of her neck, the slope of her shoulders, everything
Down to her thighs and calves, letting the words come,
As if lifted from sleep, to drift upstream,
Against the water's will, where all the condemned
And pointless labor, stunned by his voice's cadence,
Would come to a halt, and even the crazed, disheveled
Furies, for the first time, would weep, and the soot-filled
Air would clear just enough for her, the lost bride,
To step through the image of herself and be seen in the light.
As everyone knows, this was the first great poem,
Which was followed by days of sitting around
In the houses of friends, with his head back, his eyes
Closed, trying to will her return, but finding
Only himself, again and again, trapped
In the chill of his loss, and, finally,
Without a word, taking off to wander the hills
Outside of town, where he stayed until he had shaken
The image of love and put in its place the world
As he wished it would be, urging its shape and measure
Into speech of such newness that the world was swayed,
And trees suddenly appeared in the bare place
Where he spoke and lifted their limbs and swept
The tender grass with the gowns of their shade,
And stones, weightless for once, came and set themselves there,
And small animals lay in the miraculous fields of grain
And aisles of corn, and slept. The voice of light
Had come forth from the body of fire, and each thing
Rose from its depths and shone as it never had.
And that was the second great poem,
Which no one recalls anymore. The third and greatest
Came into the world as the world, out of the unsayable,
Invisible source of all longing to be; it came
As things come that will perish, to be seen or heard
Awhile, like the coating of frost or the movement
Of wind, and then no more; it came in the middle of sleep
Like a door to the infinite, and, circled by flame,
Came again at the moment of waking, and, sometimes,
Remote and small, it came as a vision with trees
By a weaving stream, brushing the bank
With their violet shade, with somebody's limbs
Scattered among the matted, mildewed leaves nearby,
With his severed head rolling under the waves,
Breaking the shifting columns of light into a swirl
Of slivers and flecks; it came in a language
Untouched by pity, in lines, lavish and dark,
Where death is reborn and sent into the world as a gift,
So the future, with no voice of its own, nor hope
Of ever becoming more than it will be, might mourn.





The End
 

Not every man knows what he shall sing at the end, 
Watching the pier as the ship sails away, or what it will seem like 
When he's held by the sea's roar, motionless, there at the end, 
Or what he shall hope for once it is clear that he'll never go back. 

When the time has passed to prune the rose or caress the cat, 
When the sunset torching the lawn and the full moon icing it down 
No longer appear, not every man knows what he'll discover instead. 
When the weight of the past leans against nothing, and the sky 

Is no more than remembered light, and the stories of cirrus 
And cumulus come to a close, and all the birds are suspended in flight, 
Not every man knows what is waiting for him, or what he shall sing 
When the ship he is on slips into darkness, there at the end.





What Work Is
 

We stand in the rain in a long line 
waiting at Ford Highland Park. For work. 
You know what work is--if you're 
old enough to read this you know what 
work is, although you may not do it. 
Forget you. This is about waiting, 
shifting from one foot to another. 
Feeling the light rain falling like mist 
into your hair, blurring your vision 
until you think you see your own brother 
ahead of you, maybe ten places. 
You rub your glasses with your fingers, 
and of course it's someone else's brother, 
narrower across the shoulders than 
yours but with the same sad slouch, the grin 
that does not hide the stubbornness, 
the sad refusal to give in to 
rain, to the hours of wasted waiting, 
to the knowledge that somewhere ahead 
a man is waiting who will say, "No, 
we're not hiring today, for any 
reason he wants. You love your brother, 
now suddenly you can hardly stand 
the love flooding you for your brother, 
who's not beside you or behind or 
ahead because he's home trying to   
sleep off a miserable night shift 
at Cadillac so he can get up 
before noon to study his German. 
Works eight hours a night so he can sing 
Wagner, the opera you hate most, 
the worst music ever invented. 
How long has it been since you told him 
you loved him, held his wide shoulders, 
opened your eyes wide and said those words, 
and maybe kissed his cheek? You've never 
done something so simple, so obvious, 
not because you're too young or too dumb, 
not because you're jealous or even mean 
or incapable of crying in 
the presence of another man, no,   
just because you don't know what work is.





On the Meeting of Garcia Lorca and Hart Crane
 

Brooklyn, 1929. Of course Crane's 
been drinking and has no idea who 
this curious Andalusian is, unable 
even to speak the language of poetry. 
The young man who brought them 
together knows both Spanish and English, 
but he has a headache from jumping 
back and forth from one language 
to another. For a moment's relief 
he goes to the window to look 
down on the East River, darkening 
below as the early night comes on. 
Something flashes across his sight, 
a double vision of such horror 
he has to slap both his hands across 
his mouth to keep from screaming. 
Let's not be frivolous, let's 
not pretend the two poets gave 
each other wisdom or love or 
even a good time, let's not 
invent a dialogue of such eloquence 
that even the ants in your own 
house won't forget it. The two 
greatest poetic geniuses alive 
meet, and what happens? A vision 
comes to an ordinary man staring 
at a filthy river. Have you ever 
had a vision? Have you ever shaken 
your head to pieces and jerked back 
at the image of your young son 
falling through open space, not 
from the stern of a ship bound 
from Vera Cruz to New York but from 
the roof of the building he works on? 
Have you risen from bed to pace 
until dawn to beg a merciless God 
to take these pictures away? Oh, yes, 
let's bless the imagination. It gives 
us the myths we live by. Let's bless 
the visionary power of the human-- 
the only animal that's got it--, 
bless the exact image of your father 
dead and mine dead, bless the images 
that stalk the corners of our sights 
and will not let go. The young man 
was my cousin, Arthur Lierberman, 
then a language student at Columbia, 
who told me all this before he died 
quietly in his sleep in 1983 
in a hotel in Perugia. A good man, 
Arthur, he survived graduate school, 
later came home to Detroit and sold 
pianos right through the Depression. 
He loaned my brother a used one 
to compose hideous songs on, 
which Arthur thought were genius. 
What an imagination Arthur had!

Mr. Van Ess bought 14 washcloths? 
Fourteen washrags, Ed Van Ess?

mixed things up for my sister Grace-- 
put the spices in the wrong place.

[What horror to awake at night]
 

What horror to awake at night 
and in the dimness see the light. 
               Time is white 
               mosquitoes bite 
I've spent my life on nothing. 

The thought that stings. How are you, Nothing, 
sitting around with Something's wife. 
               Buzz and burn 
               is all I learn 
I've spent my life on nothing.   

I'm pillowed and padded, pale and puffing 
lifting household stuffing-- 
               carpets, dishes 
               benches, fishes 
I've spent my life in nothing.

tho it does sing. 
Let's take it in

but she could not 
it changed to brown 
and town 
changed us, too.

[Keen and lovely man moved as in a dance]
 

Keen and lovely man moved as in a dance 
to be considerate in lighted, glass-walled 
almost outdoor office. Business 

wasn't all he knew. He knew music, art. 
Had a heart. "With eyes like yours I should think 
the dictaphone or did he say the flute? 

His sensitivity--it stopped you. 
And the neighbors said "She's taking lessons 
on the dictaphone as tho it were a saxophone. 

He gave the job to somebody else.

and you cross your Leggs

(Later:) 

How are the children? 
If in danger run to the woods. 

Evergreen o evergreen 
how faithful are your branches.

My life 

in the leaves and on water 
My mother and I 
                      born 
in swale and swamp and sworn 
to water 

My father 
thru marsh fog 
      sculled down 
            from high ground 
saw her face 

at the organ 
bore the weight of lake water 
      and the cold-- 
he seined for carp to be sold 
that their daughter 

might go high 
on land 
      to learn 
Saw his wife turn 
deaf 

and away 
She 
      who knew boats 
            and ropes 
no longer played 




She helped him string out nets 
for tarring 
      And she could shoot 
            He was cool 
to the man 

who stole his minnows 
by night and next day offered 
      to sell them back 
            He brought in a sack 
of dandelion greens 

if no flood 
No oranges--none at hand 
      No marsh marigold 
            where the water rose 
He kept us afloat 




I mourn her not hearing canvasbacks 
their blast-off rise 
      from the water 
            Not hearing sora 
rails's sweet 

spoon-tapped waterglass- 
descending scale- 
      tear-drop-tittle 
            Did she giggle 
as a girl? 




His skiff skimmed 
the coiled celery now gone 
      from these streams 
            due to carp 
He knew duckweed 

fall-migrates 
toward Mud Lake bottom 
      Knew what lay 
            under leaf decay 
and on pickerel weeds 

before summer hum 
To be counted on: 
      new leaves 
            new dead 
leaves 




He could not 
--like water bugs-- 
      stride surface tension 
            He netted 
loneliness 

As to his bright new car 
my mother--her house 
      next his--averred: 
            A hummingbird 
can't haul 

Anchored here 
in the rise and sink 
      of life-- 
            middle years' nights 
he sat 

beside his shoes 
rocking his chair 
      Roped not "looped 
            in the loop 
of her hair 




I grew in green 
slide and slant 
      of shore and shade 
            Child-time--wade

Maples to swing from

Grew riding the river 
Books

I was the solitary plover 
a pencil 
      for a wing-bone 
From the secret notes 
I must tilt

"We live by the urgent wave

Seven year molt

Seven years the one

One for home

O my floating life 
Do not save love 
      for things 
            Throw things

I am abandoning the rich--

among conflicting parties 
Then my family 

we shall sow our cabbages 
together

Windy City
 

The garments worn in flying dreams 
were fashioned there-- 
overcoats that swooped like kites, 
scarves streaming like vapor trails, 
gowns ballooning into spinnakers. 

In a city like that one might sail 
through life led by a runaway hat. 
The young scattered in whatever directions 
their wild hair pointed, and gusting 
into one another, fell in love. 

At night, wind rippled saxophones 
that hung like windchimes in pawnshop 
windows, hooting through each horn 
so that the streets seemed haunted   
not by nighthawks, but by doves.   

Pinwheels whirled from steeples 
in place of crosses. At the pinnacles 
of public buildings, snagged underclothes-- 
the only flag--flapped majestically. 
And when it came time to disappear 

one simply chose a thoroughfare 
devoid of memories, raised a collar, 
and turned his back on the wind. 
I closed my eyes and stepped 
into a swirl of scuttling leaves. 






Bath
 

She mops a washcloth down his spine and scrubs 
until his bones glow with the inner light of porcelain 
and when his Haloed hair bursts forth into foam 
he holds his nose and dunks beneath the soapy gloom 
ears flooding with signals 
the pipes transmit like microphones. 

The boy can hear another city, the one below 
where wind coils when it isn't howling, 
one can hear Purgatory boil 
up through the manholes, a river flushing souls 
into the underworld, tomorrow's news 
bawled at the crossroad of subway and sewer. 

If he were accidentally to swallow here 
the water would taste like silver 
off a dead man's eyes. Upstairs, 
the mute migr waitress he secretly 
adores sings naked in the shower, 
the newlyweds from Mexico 

rage about dinero, next door 
a newborn wails like a Black Maria, 
while in a hidden room, a crazy old man 
won't stop repeating "the goddamn, the goddman! 
And the boy comes up for air, 
eyes burning, rinsed hair silky, his hands 
wrinkled, Busha says, as prunes. 

Overhead, the bare bulb fogs with steam. 
She jerks the plug, the drain 
gulps a vortex of gray bathwater. 
It's time to rinse before it sucks him down, 
to stand calf-deep, lacquered with Ivory, 
smoldering before a faucet that trickles 

a cool stream at which Busha washes him 
first gently in front and then behind 
in a way that no one else will ever wash him. 
The moon, too, must be fogged above 
misted lamps that bleed into reflections 
on the marbled pane. 

He swipes abstractions in the sweat, 
finger painting night 
while Busha towels his hair 
as if reviving a drowned sailor 
the sea has graciously returned. 
Don't worry, Busha, your grandson is clean 

for Saturday night: 
ears, navel, nails, inspected, 
teeth unstained, cleansed as baptism 
leaves the soul, pure enough to sleep-- 
as you instruct him--with the angels, 
cleaner than he'll ever be again. 






At the Fishhouses
 

Although it is a cold evening, 
down by one of the fishhouses 
an old man sits netting, 
his net, in the gloaming almost invisible, 
a dark purple-brown, 
and his shuttle worn and polished. 
The air smells so strong of codfish 
it makes one's nose run and one's eyes water. 
The five fishhouses have steeply peaked roofs 
and narrow, cleated gangplanks slant up 
to storerooms in the gables 
for the wheelbarrows to be pushed up and down on. 
All is silver: the heavy surface of the sea, 
swelling slowly as if considering spilling over, 
is opaque, but the silver of the benches, 
the lobster pots, and masts, scattered 
among the wild jagged rocks, 
is of an apparent translucence 
like the small old buildings with an emerald moss 
growing on their shoreward walls. 
The big fish tubs are completely lined 
with layers of beautiful herring scales 
and the wheelbarrows are similarly plastered 
with creamy iridescent coats of mail, 
with small iridescent flies crawling on them. 
Up on the little slope behind the houses, 
set in the sparse bright sprinkle of grass, 
is an ancient wooden capstan, 
cracked, with two long bleached handles 
and some melancholy stains, like dried blood, 
where the ironwork has rusted. 
The old man accepts a Lucky Strike. 
He was a friend of my grandfather. 
We talk of the decline in the population 
and of codfish and herring 
while he waits for a herring boat to come in. 
There are sequins on his vest and on his thumb. 
He has scraped the scales, the principal beauty, 
from unnumbered fish with that black old knife, 
the blade of which is almost worn away. 

Down at the water's edge, at the place 
where they haul up the boats, up the long ramp 
descending into the water, thin silver 
tree trunks are laid horizontally 
across the gray stones, down and down 
at intervals of four or five feet. 

Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, 
element bearable to no mortal, 
to fish and to seals . . . One seal particularly 
I have seen here evening after evening. 
He was curious about me. He was interested in music; 
like me a believer in total immersion, 
so I used to sing him Baptist hymns. 
I also sang "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God. 
He stood up in the water and regarded me 
steadily, moving his head a little. 
Then he would disappear, then suddenly emerge 
almost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug 
as if it were against his better judgment. 
Cold dark deep and absolutely clear, 
the clear gray icy water . . . Back, behind us, 
the dignified tall firs begin. 
Bluish, associating with their shadows, 
a million Christmas trees stand 
waiting for Christmas. The water seems suspended 
above the rounded gray and blue-gray stones. 
I have seen it over and over, the same sea, the same, 
slightly, indifferently swinging above the stones, 
icily free above the stones, 
above the stones and then the world. 
If you should dip your hand in, 
your wrist would ache immediately, 
your bones would begin to ache and your hand would burn 
as if the water were a transmutation of fire 
that feeds on stones and burns with a dark gray flame. 
If you tasted it, it would first taste bitter, 
then briny, then surely burn your tongue. 
It is like what we imagine knowledge to be: 
dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, 
drawn from the cold hard mouth 
of the world, derived from the rocky breasts 
forever, flowing and drawn, and since 
our knowledge is historical, flowing, and flown.   






Filling Station
 

Oh, but it is dirty! 
--this little filling station, 
oil-soaked, oil-permeated 
to a disturbing, over-all 
black translucency. 
Be careful with that match! 

Father wears a dirty, 
oil-soaked monkey suit 
that cuts him under the arms, 
and several quick and saucy 
and greasy sons assist him 
(it's a family filling station), 
all quite thoroughly dirty. 

Do they live in the station? 
It has a cement porch 
behind the pumps, and on it 
a set of crushed and grease- 
impregnated wickerwork; 
on the wicker sofa 
a dirty dog, quite comfy. 

Some comic books provide 
the only note of color-- 
of certain color. They lie 
upon a big dim doily 
draping a taboret 
(part of the set), beside 
a big hirsute begonia. 

Why the extraneous plant? 
Why the taboret? 
Why, oh why, the doily? 
(Embroidered in daisy stitch 
with marguerites, I think, 
and heavy with gray crochet.) 

Somebody embroidered the doily. 
Somebody waters the plant, 
or oils it, maybe. Somebody 
arranges the rows of cans 
so that they softly say: 
esso--so--so--so 
to high-strung automobiles. 
Somebody loves us all.





The Animals are Leaving
 

One by one, like guests at a late party   
They shake our hands and step into the dark:   
Arabian ostrich; Long-eared kit fox; Mysterious starling. 

One by one, like sheep counted to close our eyes,   
They leap the fence and disappear into the woods:   
Atlas bear; Passenger pigeon; North Island laughing owl;   
Great auk; Dodo; Eastern wapiti; Badlands bighorn sheep.  

One by one, like grade school friends,   
They move away and fade out of memory:   
Portuguese ibex; Blue buck; Auroch; Oregon bison;   
Spanish imperial eagle; Japanese wolf; Hawksbill   
Sea turtle; Cape lion; Heath hen; Raiatea thrush. 

One by one, like children at a fire drill, they march outside,   
And keep marching, though teachers cry, "Come back!   
Waved albatross; White-bearded spider monkey;   
Pygmy chimpanzee; Australian night parrot;   
Turquoise parakeet; Indian cheetah; Korean tiger;   
Eastern harbor seal ; Ceylon elephant ; Great Indian rhinoceros.  

One by one, like actors in a play that ran for years   
And wowed the world, they link their hands and bow   
Before the curtain falls.

They shut me up in Prose  
As when a little Girl 
They put me in the Closet

A fairer House than Prose  
More numerous of Windows

Of Visitors  the fairest  
For Occupation  This

To gather Paradise

The Moon is distant from the Sea  
And yet, with Amber Hands  
She leads Him  docile as a Boy  
Along appointed Sands  

He never misses a Degree  
Obedient to Her eye  
He comes just so far  toward the Town  
Just so far  goes away  

Oh, Signor, Thine, the Amber Hand  
And mine  the distant Sea  
Obedient to the least command 
Thine eye impose on me

There is no Frigate like a Book

Without oppress of Toll  
How frugal is the Chariot 
That bears the Human Soul 





All overgrown by cunning moss, (146)
 

All overgrown by cunning moss, 
All interspersed with weed, 
The little cage of "Currer Bell 
In quiet "Haworth laid. 

This Bird  observing others

Retire to other latitudes  
Quietly did the same  

But differed in returning  
Since Yorkshire hills are green  
Yet not in all the nests I meet  
Can Nightingale be seen

You left me  Sire  two Legacies  
A Legacy of Love

The Way She Figured He Figured It
 

You get over these constant storms and learn to be married all over again, every day.  --Barry Hannah  
The foyer is hers because the kettle is hers as it was made for water and the water is hers
         because the sac that grew the baby was hers though the semen that made the sac was his
                                    like his boots are his and the tea that's of the kettle
 
after it enters his mouth is his unless it's hers since it's inside the kitchen that's hers
 
and therefore not his unless he's simmering the Asian sauces that are his
                  because they're dense and knotty rather than milkish and paltry
                                    like everything else from the nation state of the motherland
 
of the no-mercy child who won't stop sucking and wanting and whining in the ear that is his
 
although the child herself belongs somehow to the woman and thus its hunger is hers
                  as is the bed and dresser and mirror and latch
                                    though the hammer naturally is his and the saw and lumber
 
and back and muscle he suffered to build because he guessed he thought it would be
 
good for something besides this house like a pestilence of people who weren't his
                  because nothing was his except the whirl he carried in his belly of the mix-up
                                    of loving her in the first place like being sucked
 
into a burrow of lava embers and putting your tongue to it until it caught fire
 
and all he could say was that the burn was his--this hole in the mouth--
                  this fiasco of the woman bent now in the garden to smell the cilantro
                                    as though she didn't know his head was split
 
with hating her and loving her and hating her and loving her
 
because she was an ache and a kink and somehow the furrow--the groove and the rut--
                  and age and death and kiss and fuck and not-fuck and song and not-song
                                    and no it was not sweet though he'd go on and carry it
 
                                                      since also--since mostly--it was.
 





Beautiful Signor
 

All dreams of the soul  End in a beautiful man's or woman's body.   --Yeats, "The Phases of the Moon  
Whenever we wake, 
still joined, enraptured-- 
at the window, 
each clear night's finish 
the black pulse of dominoes 
dropping to land; 

whenever we embrace, 
haunted, upwelling, 
I know 
a reunion is taking place--      

Hear me when I say 
our love's not meant to be 
an opiate; 
helpmate, 
you are the reachable mirror 
that dares me to risk 
the caravan back 
to the apogee, the longed-for 
arms of the Beloved-- 


Dusks of paperwhites, 
dusks of jasmine, 
intimate beyond belief 

beautiful Signor 

no dread of nakedness 

beautiful Signor 

my long ship, 
my opulence, 
my garland 

beautiful Signor 

extinguishing the beggar's tin, 
the wind of longing 

beautiful Signor 

laving the ruined country, 
the heart wedded to war 

beautiful Signor 

the kiln-blaze 
in my body, 
the turning heaven 

beautiful Signor 

you cover me with pollen 

beautiful Signor 

into your sweet mouth-- 

This is the taproot: 
against all strictures, 
desecrations, 
I'll never renounce, 
never relinquish 
the first radiance, the first 
moment you took my hand-- 

This is the endless wanderlust: 
dervish, 
yours is the April-upon-April love 
that kept me spinning even beyond 
your eventful arms 
toward the unsurpassed: 

the one vast claiming heart, 
the glimmering, 
the beautiful and revealed Signor.





Bird-Understander
 

Of many reasons I love you here is one 

the way you write me from the gate at the airport 
so I can tell you everything will be alright 

so you can tell me there is a bird 
trapped in the terminal      all the people 
ignoring it       because they do not know 
what do with it       except to leave it alone 
until it scares itself to death 

it makes you terribly terribly sad 

You wish you could take the bird outside 
and set it free or       (failing that) 
call a bird-understander 
to come help the bird 

All you can do is notice the bird 
and feel for the bird       and write 
to tell me how language feels 
impossibly useless 

but you are wrong 

You are a bird-understander 
better than I could ever be 
who make so many noises 
and call them song 

These are your own words 
your way of noticing 
and saying plainly 
of not turning away 
from hurt 

you have offered them 
to me       I am only 
giving them back 

if only I could show you 
how very useless 
they are not 






Have You Prayed?
 

When the wind 
turns and asks, in my father's voice, 
Have you prayed? 

I know three things. One: 
I'm never finished answering to the dead. 

Two: A man is four winds and three fires. 
And the four winds are his father's voice, 
his mother's voice . . . 

Or maybe he's seven winds and ten fires. 
And the fires are seeing, hearing, touching, 
dreaming, thinking . . . 
Or is he the breath of God? 

When the wind turns traveler 
and asks, in my father's voice, Have you prayed? 
I remember three things. 
One: A father's love 

is milk and sugar, 
two-thirds worry, two-thirds grief, and what's left over 

is trimmed and leavened to make the bread 
the dead and the living share. 

And patience? That's to endure 
the terrible leavening and kneading. 

And wisdom? That's my father's face in sleep. 

When the wind 
asks, Have you prayed? 
I know it's only me 

reminding myself 
a flower is one station between 
earth's wish and earth's rapture, and blood 

was fire, salt, and breath long before 
it quickened any wand or branch, any limb 
that woke speaking. It's just me 

in the gowns of the wind, 
or my father through me, asking, 
Have you found your refuge yet? 
asking, Are you happy? 

Strange. A troubled father. A happy son. 
The wind with a voice. And me talking to no one.





A Hymn to Childhood
 

Childhood? Which childhood? 
The one that didn't last? 
The one in which you learned to be afraid 
of the boarded-up well in the backyard 
and the ladder in the attic? 

The one presided over by armed men 
in ill-fitting uniforms 
strolling the streets and alleys, 
while loudspeakers declared a new era, 
and the house around you grew bigger, 
the rooms farther apart, with more and more 
people missing? 

The photographs whispered to each other 
from their frames in the hallway. 
The cooking pots said your name 
each time you walked past the kitchen. 

And you pretended to be dead with your sister 
in games of rescue and abandonment. 
You learned to lie still so long 
the world seemed a play you viewed from the muffled 
safety of a wing. Look! In 
run the servants screaming, the soldiers shouting, 
turning over the furniture, 
smashing your mother's china. 

Don't fall asleep. 
Each act opens with your mother 
reading a letter that makes her weep. 
Each act closes with your father fallen 
into the hands of Pharaoh. 

Which childhood? The one that never ends? O you, 
still a child, and slow to grow. 
Still talking to God and thinking the snow 
falling is the sound of God listening, 
and winter is the high-ceilinged house 
where God measures with one eye 
an ocean wave in octaves and minutes, 
and counts on many fingers 
all the ways a child learns to say Me. 

Which childhood? 
The one from which you'll never escape? You, 
so slow to know 
what you know and don't know. 
Still thinking you hear low song 
in the wind in the eaves, 
story in your breathing, 
grief in the heard dove at evening, 
and plentitude in the unseen bird 
tolling at morning. Still slow to tell 
memory from imagination, heaven   
from here and now, 
hell from here and now, 
death from childhood, and both of them 
from dreaming.





Immigrant Blues
 

People have been trying to kill me since I was born, 
a man tells his son, trying to explain 
the wisdom of learning a second tongue. 

It's an old story from the previous century 
about my father and me. 

The same old story from yesterday morning 
about me and my son. 

It's called "Survival Strategies 
and the Melancholy of Racial Assimilation. 

It's called "Psychological Paradigms of Displaced Persons, 

called "The Child Who'd Rather Play than Study. 

Practice until you feel 
the language inside you, says the man. 

But what does he know about inside and outside, 
my father who was spared nothing 
in spite of the languages he used? 

And me, confused about the flesh and the soul, 
who asked once into a telephone, 
Am I inside you? 

You're always inside me, a woman answered, 
at peace with the body's finitude, 
at peace with the soul's disregard 
of space and time. 

Am I inside you? I asked once 
lying between her legs, confused 
about the body and the heart. 

If you don't believe you're inside me, you're not, 
she answered, at peace with the body's greed, 
at peace with the heart's bewilderment. 

It's an ancient story from yesterday evening 

called "Patterns of Love in Peoples of Diaspora, 

called "Loss of the Homeplace 
and the Defilement of the Beloved, 

called "I want to Sing but I Don't Know Any Songs.





En la Calle San Sebastin
 

Viejo San Juan, Puerto Rico, 1998
Here in a bar on the street of the saint 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
a dancer in white with a red red scarf 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
calls to the gods who were freed by slaves 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
and his bronze face is a lantern of sweat 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
and hands smack congas like flies in the field 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
and remember the beat of packing crates 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
from the days when overseers banished the drum 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
and trumpets screech like parrots of gold 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
trumpets that herald the end of the war 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
as soldiers toss rifles on cobblestone 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
and the saint himself snaps an arrow in half 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
then lost grandfathers and fathers appear 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
fingers tugging my steel-wool beard 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
whispering your beard is gray 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
spilling their rum across the table 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
till cousins lead them away to bed 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
and the dancer in white with a face of bronze 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
shakes rain from his hair like the god of storms 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
and sings for the blood that drums in the chest 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
and praises the blood that beats in the hands 
en la calle San Sebastin, 
en la calle San Sebastin.





Swells
 

The very longest swell in the ocean, I suspect, 
carries the deepest memory, the information of actions 
summarized (surface peaks and dibbles and local sharp 

slopes of windstorms) with a summary of the summaries 
and under other summaries a deeper summary: well, maybe 
deeper, longer for length here is the same as deep 

time: so that the longest swell swells least; that 
is, its effects in immediate events are least perceptible, 
a pitch to white water rising say a millimeter more 

because of an old invisible presence: and on the ocean 
floor an average so vast occurs it moves in a noticeability 
of a thousand years, every blip, though, of surface and 

intermediacy moderated into account: I like to go 
to old places where the effect dwells, summits or seas 
so hard to summon into mind, even with the natural 

ones hard to climb or weigh: I go there in my mind 
(which is, after all, where these things negotiably are) 
and tune in to the wave nearly beyond rise or fall in its 

staying and hum the constant, universal assimilation: the 
information, so packed, nearly silenced with majesty 
and communicating hardly any action: go there and 

rest from the ragged and rapid pulse, the immediate threat 
shot up in a disintegrating spray, the many thoughts and 
sights unmanageable, the deaths of so many, hungry or mad.





In Memoriam Mae Noblitt
 

This is just a place: 
we go around, distanced, 
yearly in a star's 

atmosphere, turning 
daily into and out of 
direct light and 

slanting through the 
quadrant seasons: deep 
space begins at our 

heels, nearly rousing 
us loose: we look up 
or out so high, sight's   

silk almost draws us away: 
this is just a place: 
currents worry themselves 

coiled and free in airs 
and oceans: water picks 
up mineral shadow and 

plasm into billions of 
designs, frames: trees, 
grains, bacteria: but 

is love a reality we 
made here ourselves-- 
and grief--did we design 

that--or do these, 
like currents, whine 
in and out among us merely 

as we arrive and go: 
this is just a place: 
the reality we agree with, 

that agrees with us, 
outbounding this, arrives 
to touch, joining with 

us from far away: 
our home which defines 
us is elsewhere but not 

so far away we have   
forgotten it: 
this is just a place.





Hypothetical Antipodes, Judgment
 

Hardly any of me is solid any more, I mean I buy 
things every day. 
And there comes a time when I am feeling 
as windblowed as the apples 
in the Shenandoah. 
And there goes I who then again began 
tho what does this Mrs. Begin? 
(she says I am) 

And cast down me wretched 
sinner unto thee I am 
slightly different from 
a corpse at a funeral 
in that I am less made up 
but made up worse. 

Who I thereby did appoint myself 
but forgot which was mirror. 
I stand stabbed with wrench piss 
rabid at the counter 
matter of things in the room 
with which I 
identify. 

Somewheres crossed up in hot 
antartic mountains 
they live backwards together. 

Whose feet then were backwards 
whose feet were needing shoes 
so badly in 1964 that millions 
virtual millions of shoes were 
sent to "Appalachia Virginia 
for they were too poor--"backward. 
America glared haughtily at 
local shoe burnings that Christmas. 

But I'm not antarctical 
nor hypo 
thetic. 

My mind gleams like the fangs 
of a viper in white heat 
dying to sink my teeth into 
the throat of something wrong.





from Saying Grace
 

for my mother
the living  

    1. 
After Independence Day 
all our toys began to tear 
up, school growing sweet 

on our tongues. We had 
already cut & hoed 
the cotton into rows, weeds 

piled useless as Confederate 
bills. September meant picking 
& half-days at Springfield, us colored 

grades let off at noon to pick 
the valuable white till 
nightfall. My hands, civil 

& slow, didn't even deserve 
my behind on the picking truck, 
but Unc Chock ran the thing 

& Mama would've killed him dead 
if he'd dreamt of trying 
to get salty. The money was bad 

like all money then, not near 
as green or wide. Three dollars 
for a hundred pounds, better part 

of a day. I barely kept up, hands swole up 
like unpicked fruit. No matter when 
she started, Frankie plucked fifteen pounds 

more, food for two, a new 
Easter dress. Summers I turned 
so black & bent, all because I'd rather 

pick with friends than sling weeds 
alone, than stuff my mattress green. 


    2. 
Winters, when the white king 
had gone, we slept like fish, still 
moving. We walked back home 
for lunch & retraced after school, changing 
into our other pair of drawers 
before we chored the stove's ash. No one 

got gas till after the War. Each November 
brought a boxcar from the Atchison 
Topeka & Santa Fe; for a share, 
Lopez balanced it home on his flatbed, 
a whale from the hunt. Once full 
of hobos, that bell we burnt kept us 

from freezing all season long. Before 
tossing each board in, I would run 
my hands across the wood speech 
of burns, carvings warning 
Unfriendly Conductor, Town of No 
Sleep. Leftover wood turned 

to toys; three boards & somebody's 
old rollerskate became a summer 
scooter. Bored, what was that? 
We were too busy being poor 
in that house air-conditioned all winter, 
too busy sharing everything, even 

bathwater evenings by the pipe stove. 
No plumbing, no rats, only mice thick 
enough to believe we had more 
than they did. 






Winter Journal: The Sky Is the Lost Orpheum
 

The shelter of it carved, caved 
Across the river, the park and the little Ferris wheel 
       closed down 
The great oaks emptying, russet, gusseted 
the hovering slant light leaking from the outer edge 
       of cloud bed 
leads and shawls pulled forth 
Thy synchrony of the lost elements recovered 
the shivering water surfaces, planar unmeldings, remeldings, 
       riverine alchemies, unlocketed selves 
now the reemergence, the sun pouring global gold 
       uptilted, gobleted, incanted 
Am I not as God made me but stranger? 
Made stranger still by what I have seen 
at this hour of earth untended, unministered-- 
light caught up in the river's grooved tread 
That sun more like a mass grope out of emptiness 
       and the black river weeds before it, torn and trained, 
       rocketed and stark and stuck-to 
The tall shadow of the willow grows forth 
And the spare stems of the grasses and the rods of the mullein 
And these are the stations of this river 
The houses and the boats and the parked cars 
The growing wedge the ducks make moving forward, the shape 
       of the element there among the weeds that jut forward, 
the mass of the willows growing deeper in green and sundering 
The backfall of sun going downward 
The surface of the river coming clear of its own admixture 
The ducks moving over like slow planes in formation, 
       barely seen needles hauling white threads, 
       secretly heeding 
The fish in my skin relinquishes 
Will I know then what I have become? 
The river darkens from its end of trees closing in 
There is the sun and this deep depression 
Exiting as viewed in this river





Winter Journal: Gray Shadings
 

Barely discerned clouds 
Hard, hard to get here 
what worth, what worth 
River of steel. 
River of no one becoming you. 
Trees that are emptier today, more forced in their forms 
To focus on them is to be made glad of them in their 
       strangeness 
The earth extrudes through them toward emptiness 
The few elms dismembering 
The willow's bloom above shore like a curtaining 
To focus on it is to be mostly taken into its tapes 
       and its filters 
It is lost to the surface of this river 
The dull, impenetrable, intractable surface 
resisting, unetchable 
Now the faint rain. 
I don't know what to do with all this waiting 
things getting themselves readied toward emptiness 
The scratchy, shattering elm, its crimped skin, its 
       exfoliating, its rivening 
       its being disfigured by fortune 
       and by wind 
A crone with old frills at her hair 
The grasp of her toward me





Winter Journal: Scratchings among the Burnings
 

clouds in rafts above, upon one another, pushed up along 
       the margin of sky 
       dark underbellies 
Shirring of grasses and the nearly empty apple tree behind 
Where is this beginning from? 
The roll of clouds bolsters up close 
       moves vaguely east 
Hear the interstate, its rush of backdrop constant 
Oh those deep colors are something sacred 
There are patches of olive green, chartreuse, umber, piled 
       against each other, snapping and smoking almost 
       and then the empty prongs and systems 
       cross-hatchings 
       against the grays, burnished and glowing 
The cloud roll has changed now, been buffeted slowly 
       into bunches, disorganizing 
Oh, these torches before me that seem to burn brighter 
       as the light fades 
This aching gradation, smear and 
       gleam-forth and then the bare black hands up through 
       splaying and forcing the crowns 
       so slightly, just a tender worrying up from inside 
       the swollen gloves, the spheres of them, the undoing 
       the serial falling-off 
Furious brocade, yes, devastation 
That one oak in its torque 
and above, against the maddening subtle surface of the sky 
       the barely defined roads upon it, the passages 
       the growings-forth 
       gobbed and wrought, rich impasto 
       stubborn, unbecoming 
Now the grays, almost purple, seem to move forward 
       branching up from out of the background 
       darkening forth 
       surge from within the mass 
       organisms coming up against each other, bulging and turning 
       off, roiling 
       slow and mesmeric 
       the contained motion of it rooted 
       static movement, within stasis 
       painstaking 
       damage then recovery, damage then recovery 
A lighter band of sky now, stratum between dark cloud and 
       complicated span of tree-frieze 
       layering, up-changing 
       free-needled, built-up duns and copperings 
       score and rose-green gore, stitch and fret 
       always upon the under-thing, the broad backing up over 
       the one





Winter Journal: Disseminate Birds over Water
 

The reservoir churned and cloud-deformed 
The far line of hills, fused, bunched color 
bitter wind against this hunch 
my folded bones 
I can see the rust earth beneath trees, the rough mats 
       gathering weight in semi-darkness, dim 
       nesting bases of trees 
Graft of dark cloud upon lighter one behind, building up 
       of something, a thickening, deposit of cold air, dark web 
       of insistence, built up in me 
How long can it be here? 
A simmering of trees, a dark moiling 
       a winter weight 
       a mid-shimmering of heat-distorted things 
The positioning of bolts of deep orange, gold-green and amber 
       molded, wicked in together 
Drops in pressure, now, a field of cold, a shift 
       between rain and snow 
The movement into this remembering 
       of separate things, train sounding its horn, removing 
       itself from the scene 
Snow thickening the far bars of trees, graying them in 
Blotting, dulling, gauzing over this dream 
It is snowfalling, it is beauty-filling and cleansing 
       this burn of words 
       it is delivering something seeming to uplift and to begin 
       pressing downward, this ink into frozen droplet 
       this thing 

Snow plinking in the leaves, the left hands of trees 
       the neat levers and pulls 
       the odd weeds 
The rich fringe of emptying trees 
       the shifted pins 
the breaks into dense pines into period reeds into gutterings 
What happens to the opposite shore 
       is untenable 
       is unmanageable to me 
That stratagem of damage, that unmattering 
Believe me it is some abomination of things being killed and 
       that mattering to me 
That exquisite built thing that is obliterated 
       its tiny white amplitude, its singing crushed into 
       particles, its must on the undersides of leaves 
Now I am sure 
       the world has not unfolded before me 
       anymore but has closed into rows 
       of its foldings 
Something in the collections of those trees 
       bare branches upthrust, the brush of them 
       bare branches up-brushed 
       their lip along mesh of shore weeds, the flanged grasses 
       the scrim of their midst 
       I am in them again 
       meddling in darks that are in them 
       and the white gold that is their outermost 
       screen that is their leafleting their grief that is in me 
       thin dredge of pebbles and 
       strange glandular patternings of trees 
       against trees against cut-bank against breath 

The rubied lung of sumac 
       tragedian





Winter Journal: Fish Rises, Dark Brown Muscle Turns Over
 

rings diminish, duck reflects flight then threads off 
Long branch of land, rusted oaks smoldering 
       fawn shore, grasses bare scripts of green 
       black fingerbones of the willows, splayed 
       rubric fringe of the reeds at the edge of water 
The reflection is its own blurred dream 
The blended edges, furred thing 
tawny path of stalks brushed into gray slope behind 
Bright yellow mostly gone now, the dominance 
       of dulled bronze, ochrous, ferrous grooves of 
       the several oaks 
The wrought planes and hinges of things 
Strange, held-off symmetry, axis of waterline 
       rubbed, smeared, edge-shifted 
What is real then made more so through 
       an intervention of element 
The chipmunk's tail jerks in synch with its mouth-pops 
Stares hard at me from a dead willow stump 
Who are you and what have you done? 
Things moving in the leaves behind me. 
Dog barks from far across fields 
Single bird oars across lake 
The sky deep in: dark oxygens 
crimp of leaf edging in dried weed stalk 
miniature seedpods held forward 
calligraphic against gray water, white stones 
chipmunk-rustle, upturn duff, chirp storm whirl off, hold still 
       hold still 
Gravity picks and fidgets 

How each blade and bract is angled just so 
       arches, etched kerns 
       scroll of deft beech leaf 
       Baroque script of dried vines 
       their wall of texture coming down 
Crows burr into woods 
fish plinks through and slacks under 
ducks quilt across sky, through sky-water 
mottled beads hovering, unchaining 
Reflection is a real thing set 
       in perpetual motion, as if electron 
       spinning and jittering made visible 
       the static progressions 
The waving laminations of white stone 
the wandering rift through 
the pulse-veins 
Breathing thing, made to breathe, graven so 

Now the delicate hammers 
pure cuts of bird 
steel rings reassembling 
Quit path under oak 
Something moves off a dark road 
Deep-embroidered quiet 
the tickets slip 
thicket in 
meter-tick of duck taking off 
       keep close, brush close to surface 
       furl between bird and mirror-bird 
I am vested in sensation 
a suspension of yellow maple amid stalks of oak 
       distillate of leaves 
       saffron particulate 
Deep sea of trees, fanned tops of oak corals, collective bend 
fast tappers high up 
flapping across water 
back up the damp trough 
trees closing in 
two deer pick across, turn back 
       clatter through woods 
       encircling





Winter Journal: Wind Thumbs through Woods
 

slant hand of beech leaves 
shag of oaks before water 
When did you go missing from me? 
That passage between limb and slipped skin 
gouged hickories, the ermine-bright birch 
through all that is traveling slopeward 
       circleting leaf through branch weave 
       corymbs of curled leaves 
       lone cedar document rising 
Through trees that far land moves descant 
the old rusts and pastes undershined 
Don't you ever think this is so strange? 
the sibilant drift of dried leaves 
the coming down all to some shambles 
the encroachments on the innermost things 
Don't you feel how everything is strained beyond 
       certain remembering? 
The limbs break their fragile whisks into 
The sky is a shroud pulled up over 
Each leaf of the beech has its wisdom held fast 
its little death ship 
I cannot wake up from inside 
       this burrow into fundaments of leaves 
The cold drills down into the stone 
the almost-extracted green 
the bird cloaked up under the ribs 
the dull gleams





Winter Journal: Threshed Blue, Cardings, Dim Tonsils
 

stripped batting of cloud 
glimpsed ligaments 
dusk coming up under 
lithographic, nib-hatchings 
       instruments click 
       the fine-sprung locust 
       replicate dinge along hill-lines 
       tailings of umber, the rust smudge 
There is still that hemmed ocean of oaks 
       the various reds, the somehow 
       silver cast over the brown-gold 
       the under-brushed shadows 
How can there be more of their dispensing 
       into air? 
The night-openings of the trees 
The thousand clefts into 
Their corridors shiver and merge and piece apart 
There is no one beside what was once river 
Only the carbons incoming 
       accreting in leaves 
Love of old oaks unencumbering 
Root-beauties brought through 
crude sieves of bare trees 
the few fastened leaves 
Those pods are like tongues or like sickles 
The blades have been pulled from their sheaths 
The backs of the clouds now upturned 
They herd from pink seas 
They make their untouchable stream 
       through regions of steep emptiness 
       against which the trees have their gestures 
Drop down, drop down toward me 
your little sleek scars 
Make your bed in rough cedars 
clangor of darks numbering in 
clusters of trunks and spoked lungs 
the thistles that work at the gums





The Dog Stoltz
 

The dog Stoltz pushed his paw pads into my neck, 
the warm, beaten leather deep under my chin, 
and let slip the one paw to up near my mouth 
with all the filth of the many blocks we trod, 
together trod, a well-moistened, adenoidal sound, 
part sigh and part growl, coming out of him, 
transported, he seemed, in a slow-motion delirium 
as I tickled his chest and behind his ear 
when he just then told me he'd tear out my throat, 
looked in my eye and smiled, best as a dog can, 
then turned ruminative and spoke once more: 
--I simply have to knock off that essay on Sassoon. 
This would have been Sassoon the war poet, understand. 
Dogs cannot write. My mother told me this. 
As for his talk, well, I took no special notice. 
His love of the war poets was well known. 
Stoltz would have been part bull and something else. 
Two friends walked by just then, handily as these things go, 
and inquired of us sitting down there on the stoop, 
not even, a doorway merely, along a busy street, 
how went the day and what pursuits was I attending; 
but what interested the two of them most 
were the tergiversations of the dog Stoltz, 
first beast, then scholar, then abject and adored. 
(Say, who among us does not care to be undressed?) 
He was not really my dog, you see, and of this made note, 
but were glad as well at my having a new dog in my life. 
It was a busy stretch of pavement, Amsterdam maybe, 
or Broadway, or farther down just south of Chelsea. 
I can tell you it was the West Side, of that I'm certain, 
and it was mild, spring-like, a few drops in the air. 
The friends passed along and the dog Stoltz slept. 
He was not my dog, you know. He simply followed me out 
of what can only have been a very fine home, 
such were his graces, his recondite tastes. 
But he was a killer too, and rather smelled. 
I cannot accommodate another animal now, please understand. 
I am between places. I will yearn for Stoltz, but no. 






Before Dawn on Bluff Road
 

The crow's raw hectoring cry   
scoops clean an oval divot 
of sky, its fading echo 
among the oaks and poplars swallowed 
first by a jet banking west 
then the Erie-Lackawanna 
sounding its horn as it comes through the tunnel 
through the cliffs to the river 
and around the bend of King's Cove Bluff, 
full of timber, Ford chassis, rock salt. 

You can hear it in the dark 
from beyond what was once the amusement park. 
And the wind carries along as well, 
from down by the river, 
when the tide's just so, 
the drainage just so, 
the chemical ghost of old factories, 
the rotted piers and warehouses: 
lye, pigfat, copra from Lever Bros., 
formaldehyde from the coffee plant, 
dyes, unimaginable solvents-- 
a soup of polymers, oxides, 
tailings fifty years old 
seeping through the mud, the aroma 
almost comforting by now, like food, 
wafting into my childhood room 
with its fevers and dreams. 
My old parents asleep, 
only a few yards across the hall, 
door open--lest I cry? 
                                 I remember 
almost nothing of my life. 






The Tartar Swept
 

The Tartar swept across the plain 

In their furs and silk panties 

Snub-nose monkey men with cinders for eyes 

Attached to their ponies like centaurs 

Forcing the snowy passes of the Carpathians 

Streaming from defiles like columns of ants 

Arraying their host in a vasty wheel 

White, gray, black and chestnut steeds 

10,000 each to a quadrant 

Turning, turning at the Jenuye's command 

This terrible pinwheel 

Gathering speed like a Bulgar dance 

Faster and faster 

Until it explodes, columns of horsemen 

Peeling away in all the four directions 

Hard across the puszta 

Dust from their hooves darkening the sky 

They fall upon village and town 

Like raptors, like tigers, like wolves on the fold 

Mauling the zsa-zsas 

And leaving them senseless in puddles of goaty drool 

Smashing balalaikas 

Ripping the ears off hussars and pissing in the wounds 

They for whom the back of a horse 

Is their only country 

For whom a roof and four walls is like unto a grave 

And a city, ptuh, a city 

A pullulating sore that exists to be scourged 

Stinky dumb nomads with blood still caked 

On shield and cuirass 

And the yellow loess from the dunes of the Takla Makan 

And the Corridor of Kansu 

Between their toes and caught in their scalps 

Like storm clouds in the distance 

Fast approaching 

With news of the steppes, the lagoons and Bitter Lakes 

Edicts, torchings, infestation 

The smoke of chronicles 

Finding their way by the upper reaches 

Of the Selinga and the Irtysh 

To Issyk-Kul, the Aral, and then the Caspian 

Vanquishing the Bashkirs and Alans 

By their speed outstripping rumor 

Tireless mounts, short-legged and strong 

From whose backs arrows are expertly dispatched 

As fast as they can be pulled from the quiver 

Samarkand, Bukhara, Harat, Nishapur 

More violent in every destruction 

This race of men which had never before been seen 

With their roving fierceness 

Scarcely known to ancient documents 

From beyond the edge of Scythia 

From beyond the frozen ocean 

Pouring out of the Caucasus 

Surpassing every extreme of ferocity 

From the Don to the Dniester 

The Black Sea to the Pripet Marshes 

Laying waste the Ostrogoth villages 

Taking with them every last cookie 

Then dicking the help 

These wanton boys of nature 

Who shot forward like a bolt from on high 

Routing with great slaughter 

All they could come to grips with 

In their wild career 

Their beautiful shifting formations 

Thousands advancing at the wave of a scarf 

Then doubling back or making a turn 

With their diabolical sallies and feints 

Remorseless and in poor humor 

So they arrived at the gates of Christendom 






There She Is
 

When I go into the garden, there she is. 
The specter holds up her arms to show 
that her hands are eaten off. 
She is silent because of the agony. 
There is blood on her face. 
I can see she has done this to herself. 
So she would not feel the other pain. 
And it is true, she does not feel it. 
She does not even see me. 
It is not she anymore, but the pain itself 
that moves her. I look and think 
how to forget. How can I live while she 
stands there? And if I take her life 
what will that make of me? I cannot 
touch her, make her conscious. 
It would hurt her too much. 
I hear the sound all through the air 
that was her eating, but it is on its own now, 
completely separate from her. I think 
I am supposed to look. I am not supposed 
to turn away. I am supposed to see each detail 
and all expression gone. My God, I think, 
if paradise is to be here 
it will have to include her.





Lies and Longing
 

Half the women are asleep on the floor
on pieces of cardboard. 
One is face down under a blanket 
with her feet and ankle bracelet showing. 
Her spear leans against the wall by her head 
where she can reach it. 
The woman who sits on a chair won't speak 
because this is not her dress. 
An old woman sings an Italian song in English 
and says she wants her name in lights: 
Faye Runaway. Tells about her grown children. 
One asks for any kind of medicine. 
One says she has a rock that means honor 
and a piece of fur. 
One woman's feet are wrapped in rags. 
One keeps talking about how fat she is 
so nobody will know she's pregnant. 
They lie about getting letters. 
One lies about a beautiful dead man. 
One lies about Denver. Outside 
it's Thirtieth Street and hot and no sun.





Night Music
 

She sits on the mountain that is her home 
and the landscapes slide away. One goes down 
and then up to the monastery. One drops away 
to a winnowing ring and a farmhouse where a girl 
and her mother are hanging the laundry. 
There's a tiny port in the distance where 
the shore reaches the water. She is numb 
and clear because of the grieving in that world. 
She thinks of the bandits and soldiers who 
return to the places they have destroyed. 
Who plant trees and build walls and play music 
in the village square evening after evening, 
believing the mothers of the boys they killed 
and the women they raped will eventually come 
out of the white houses in their black dresses 
to sit with their children and the old. 
Will listen to the music with unreadable eyes.





The Weight
 

Two horses were put together in the same paddock. 
Night and day. In the night and in the day 
wet from heat and the chill of the wind 
on it. Muzzle to water, snorting, head swinging 
and the taste of bay in the shadowed air. 
The dignity of being. They slept that way, 
knowing each other always. 
Withers quivering for a moment, 
fetlock and the proud rise at the base of the tail, 
width of back. The volume of them, and each other's weight. 
Fences were nothing compared to that. 
People were nothing. They slept standing, 
their throats curved against the other's rump. 
They breathed against each other, 
whinnied and stomped. 
There are things they did that I do not know. 
The privacy of them had a river in it. 
Had our universe in it. And the way 
its border looks back at us with its light. 
This was finally their freedom. 
The freedom an oak tree knows. 
That is built at night by stars.





Alone with the Goddess
 

The young men ride their horses fast 
on the wet sand of Parangtritis. 
Back and forth, with the water sliding 
up to them and away. 
This is the sea where the goddess lives, 
angry, her lover taken away. 
Don't wear red, don't wear green here, 
the people say. Do not swim in the sea. 
Give her an offering. 
I give a coconut to protect 
the man I love. The water pushes it back. 
I wade out and throw it farther. 
"The goddess does not accept your gift, 
an old woman says. 
I say perhaps she likes me 
and we are playing a game. 
The old woman is silent, 
the horses wear blinders of cloth, 
the young men exalt in their bodies, 
not seeing right or left, pretending 
to be brave. Sliding on and off 
their beautiful horses 
on the wet beach at Parangtritis.





Im Over the Moon
 

I don't like what the moon is supposed to do. 
Confuse me, ovulate me, 

spoon-feed me longing. A kind of ancient 
date-rape drug. So I'll howl at you, moon, 

I'm angry. I'll take back the night. Using me to 
swoon at your questionable light, 

you had me chasing you, 
the world's worst lover, over and over 

hoping for a mirror, a whisper, insight. 
But you disappear for nights on end 

with all my erotic mysteries 
and my entire unconscious mind. 

How long do I try to get water from a stone? 
It's like having a bad boyfriend in a good band. 

Better off alone. I'm going to write hard 
and fast into you, moon, face-fucking. 

Something you wouldn't understand. 
You with no swampy sexual 

promise but what we glue onto you. 
That's not real. You have no begging 

cunt. No panties ripped off and the crotch 
sucked. No lacerating spasms 

sending electrical sparks through the toes. 
Stars have those. 

What do you have? You're a tool, moon. 
Now, noon. There's a hero. 

The obvious sun, no bullshit, the enemy 
of poets and lovers, sleepers and creatures. 

But my lovers have never been able to read 
my mind. I've had to learn to be direct. 

It's hard to learn that, hard to do. 
The sun is worth ten of you. 

You don't hold a candle 
to that complexity, that solid craze. 

Like an animal carcass on the road at night, 
picked at by crows, 

taunting walkers and drivers. Your face 
regularly sliced up by the moving 

frames of car windows. Your light is drawn, 
quartered, your dreams are stolen. 

You change shape and turn away, 
letting night solve all night's problems alone.





Parthenogenesis
 

It's easy to make more of myself by eating, 
and sometimes easy's the thing. 

To be double-me, half the trouble 
but not lonely. 

Making cakes to celebrate any old day. 
Eating too much: the emperor of being used. 

Nature, mature and feminized, 
naturalizes me naturally by creating 

the feeling of being a natural woman, 
like a sixteen-year-old getting knocked up 

again. To solve that problem, 
there's the crispness of not eating, 

a pane of glass with a bloody-edged 
body, that is, having the baby at the prom 

undetected and, in a trance of self-preservation, 
throwing it away in the girls' room trash. 

Buried under paper towels, silent. 
Nothing could be better, for the teenager. 

For me, starving, that coreless, useful feeling, 
is not making myself smaller 

but making myself bigger, inside. 
It's prince and pauper both, it's starving artist 

and good model in one masterpiece. 
It rhymes with marveling and that's no accident. 

Fullness is dullness. Dreaming's too easy. 
But sometimes I don't care. 

Sometimes I put in just the right amount, 
but then I'm the worst kinds of patsy, a chump 

giving myself over to myself like a criminal 
to the law, with nothing to show for it. 

No reward, no news, no truth. 
It's too sad to be so ordinary every day. 

Like some kind of employee. 
Being told what to do. Chop off a finger 

to plant in fertilizer (that is, in used animal 
food), to grow a finger tree. 

More fingers for me. Stop saying finger. 
I'm the one in charge here. 

Stop the madness and just eat the mirror. 
Put it in sideways or crush it 

into a powder. It doesn't hurt and it works. 
Mouth full, don't talk. 

Nothing to say. I'll be a whole new person. 
I'll make her myself. Then we'll walk away. 

We'll say to each other how she's changed. 
How we wouldn't have recognized us.





One Love Story, Eight Takes
 

                                    Where you are tender, you speak your plural.                                      Roland Barthes 

                                               1 

One version of the story is I wish you back-- 
that I used each evening evening out 
what all day spent wrinkling. 

I bought a dress that was so extravagantly feminine 
you could see my ovaries through it. 

This is how I thought I would seduce you. 
This is how frantic I hollowed out. 


                                                   2 

Another way of telling it 
is to hire some kind of gnarled 

and symbolic troll to make 
a tape recording. 

Of plastic beads coming unglued 
from a child's jewelry box. 

This might be an important sound, 
like serotonin or mighty mitochondria, 

so your body hears about 
how you stole the ring made 

from a glittery opiate 
and the locket that held candy. 


                                                    3 

It's only fair that I present yet another side, 
as insidious as it is, 

because two sides hold up nothing but each other. 

A tentacled skepticism, 
a suspended contempt, 

such fancies and toxins form a third wall. 

A mean way to end 
and I never dreamed we meant it. 


                                                    4 

Another way of putting it is like 
slathering jam on a scrape. 

Do sweets soothe pain or simply make it stick? 
Which is the worst! So much technology 
and no fix for sticky if you can't taste it. 

I mean there's no relief unless. 
So I'm coming, all this excitement, 

to your house. To a place where there's no room for play. 
It is possible you'll lock me out and I'll finally 
focus on making mudcakes look solid in the rain. 


                                                    5 

In some cultures the story told is slightly different-- 
in that it is set in an aquarium and the audience participates 

as various fish. The twist comes when it is revealed 
that the most personally attractive fish have eyes 

only on one side and repel each other like magnets. 
The starfish is the size of an eraser and does as much damage. 

Starfish, the eponymous and still unlikely hero, has 
those five pink moving suckerpads 

that allow endless permutations so no solid memory, 
no recent history, nothing better, left unsaid. 


                                                    6 

The story exists even when there are no witnesses, 
kissers, tellers. Because secrets secrete, 

and these versions tend to be slapstick, as if in a candy 
factory the chocolate belted down the conveyor too fast 

or everyone turned sideways at the same time by accident. 
This little tale tries so hard to be humorous, 

wants so badly to win affection and to lodge. 
Because nothing is truly forgotten and loved. 


                                                    7 

Three million Richards can't be wrong. 
So when they levy a critique of an undertaking which, 

in their view, overtakes, I take it seriously. 
They think one may start a tale off whingy 

and wretched in a regular voice. 
But when one strikes out whimsically, 

as if meta-is-better, as if it isn't you, 
as if this story is happening to nobody 

it is only who you are fooling that's nobody. 
The Richards believe you cannot 

privately jettison into the sky, just for fun. 
You must stack stories from the foundation up. 

From the sad heart and the feet tired of supporting it. 
Language is architecture, after all, not an air capsule, 

not a hang glide. This is real life. 
So don't invite anyone to a house that hasn't been built. 

Because no one unbuilds meticulously 
and meticulosity is what allows hearing. 

Three million Richards make one point. 
I hear it in order to make others. Mistake. 


                                                    8 

As it turns out, there is a wrong way to tell this story. 
I was wrong to tell you how muti-true everything is, 

when it would be truer to say nothing. 
I've invented so much and prevented more. 

But, I'd like to talk with you about other things, 
in absolute quiet. In extreme context. 

To see you again, isn't love revision? 
It could have gone so many ways. 

This just one of the ways it went. 
Tell me another.





Drift
 

I'll go anywhere to leave you but come with me. 
All the cities are like you anyway. Windows 
darken when I get close enough to see. 
Any place we want to stay's polluted, 

the good spots taken already by those 
who ruin them. And restaurants we'd never find. 
We'd rut a ditch by a river in nights 
so long they must be cut by the many pairs 

of wrong-handled scissors maybe god owns 
and doesn't share. I water god. 
I make a haunted lake and rinse and rinse. 
I take what I want, and have ever since what 

I want disappeared, like anything hunted. 
That's what you said. Disappointment 
isn't tender, dried and wide instead. 
The tourists snapped you crying, 

and the blanket I brought was so dirty 
it must have been lying around 
in lice and blood that whole year we fought. 
It wasn't clear, so I forgot.

I haven't been sleeping, next to you 
twitching to bury my boring eyes. 
The ship made you sad, and the ferry, and canoe. 
All boats do.





Embarrassment
 

It's a wave, isn't it? Not a particle.
A fresh, cool wave, so why am I flushed
and not washed? Why dirtier than before?
 
 
1. Eymology
 
On the subject of our names.
They're so embracing,
thinking they're all us
 
and swallowing themselves
into our nausea.
 
Yet we never quite die on the spot.
We put off being what we're called,
we take the hint.
 
Time is never wasted.
It is always spent.
 
 
2. Teleology
 
Sheer fabric trailing through 4 a.m.
I thought it was opaque and earlier.
 
 
3. Mathematics
 
I know you know I know.
And the mirror multiplies inside.
 
The world is no bigger, but next time
do the math,
 
because I wanted to know none
of what I now know twice.
 
 
4. The Principle of the Borg
 
Saying "There's no one like me
accomplishes the exact opposite
of what you mean.
 
It is true only insofar as it is true
for everyone equally.
 
So it means you are not special
in any way. Which should be enough for you.
 
 
5. Documentary
 
This clothing, a maladaptive wrapping,
cuts me up. I am a vignette,
 
floated knowingly
since I pulled myself through myself,
 
like a unitard. Too many eyeholes
 
have been cut and pieced together
to make flesh less various with others.
 
 
6. Medicine
 
The cure for embarrassment
is substitution.
 
Strap, don't pluck.
Baldness makes headlines.
 
Use grass. Use less.
Shorts under your skirt for recess.
 
Redo the surfaces of your wrong turns to make
taking them smoother in the future.
 
 
7. Cosmology
 
Things are less embarrassing
at the cellular level. Remember?
 
We were a whole part of the universe
before Mother busted the party.
 
Before we were ourselves.
Now, like dirty soap, we
 
attract what we repel.
 
 
8. Apology
 
Even the clumsiest fate is perfectly shaped,
so the view took over looking
 
but the sweetest thing I've ever known
is obscene with a beautiful
 
sugar rotted down to its truth.
 
Loving you a serious accidental shame
and day flatulates into night,
 
trips and falls in front of millions
into morning.
 
In thrall to this pocus:
the end of fear starts
 
with such an annihilating blush,
with such a stutter.





A Poets Poem
 

If it takes me all day, 
I will get the word freshened out of this poem. 

I put it in the first line, then moved it to the second, 
and now it won't come out. 

It's stuck. I'm so frustrated, 
so I went out to my little porch all covered in snow 

and watched the icicles drip, as I smoked 
a cigarette.

Finally I reached up and broke a big, clear spike 
off the roof with my bare hand. 

And used it to write a word in the snow. 
I wrote the word snow. 

I can't stand myself.





Corned Beef and Cabbage
 

I can see her in the kitchen,   
Cooking up, for the hundredth time,   
A little something from her   
Limited Midwestern repertoire.   
Cigarette going in the ashtray,   
The red wine pulsing in its glass,   
A warning light meaning   
Everything was simmering   
Just below the steel lid   
Of her smile, as she boiled   
The beef into submission,   
Chopped her way   
Through the vegetable kingdom   
With the broken-handled knife   
I use tonight, feeling her   
Anger rising from the dark   
Chambers of the head   
Of cabbage I slice through,   
Missing her, wanting   
To chew things over   
With my mother again.





Three Six Five Zero
 

I called up tech and got the voicemail code.   
It's taken me this long to find my feet.   
Since last we spoke that evening it has snowed.   

Fifty-four new messages. Most are old   
and blinking into a future months complete.   
I contacted tech to get my voicemail code   

to hear your voice, not some bozo on the road   
the week of Thanksgiving dubbing me his sweet   
and breaking up and bleating how it snowed   

the Nashville side of Chattanooga and slowed   
the beltway to a standstill. The radio said sleet.   
The kid in tech sent on my voicemail code.   

I blew a night on lightening the system's load,   
woke to white enveloping the trees, the street   
that's blanked out by my leaving. It had snowed.   

Lately others' pasts will turn me cold.   
I heard out every message, pressed delete.   
I'd happily forget my voice, the mail, its code.   
We spoke at last that evening. Then it snowed.





January Drought
 

It needn't be tinder, this juncture of the year,   
a cigarette second guessed from car to brush.   

The woods' parchment is given   
to cracking asunder the first puff of wind.   
Yesterday a big sycamore came across First   
and Hawthorne and is there yet.   

The papers say it has to happen,   
if just as dribs and drabs on the asbestos siding.   
But tonight is buckets of stars as hard and dry as dimes.   

A month's supper things stacks in the sink.   
Tea brews from water stoppered in the bath   
and any thirst carried forward is quenched thinking you,   
piece by piece, an Xmas gift hidden   
and found weeks after: the ribbon, the box.   

I have reservoirs of want enough   
to freeze many nights over.





Game Night
 

Love not   
being in the loop.   

Grant the spruces' wish,   
the golf compound   
graying out of use,   
suvs in the it lot,   
power outage,   
a chorus from the quad.   

Bless the elsewhere   
where others are   
not here or you.   

And rain   
after midnight . . .       
Ask yourself,   
is that rain or bells?





The Vigil
 

Because he was as hard to handle   
As truth, which we equate with light,   
Go somewhere dark and hold a candle   
For Alan Sullivan tonight.





Uptick
 

We were sitting there, and   
I made a joke about how   
it doesn't dovetail: time,   
one minute running out   
faster than the one in front   
it catches up to.   
That way, I said,   
there can be no waste.   
Waste is virtually eliminated.   

To come back for a few hours to   
the present subject, a painting,   
looking like it was seen,   
half turning around, slightly apprehensive,   
but it has to pay attention   
to what's up ahead: a vision.   
Therefore poetry dissolves in   
brilliant moisture and reads us   
to us.   
A faint notion. Too many words,   
but precious.





El Dorado
 

We have a friend in common, the retired sophomore.   
His concern: that I shall get it like that,   
in the right and righter of a green bush   
chomping on future considerations. In the ghostly   
dreams of others it appears I am all right,   
and even going on tomorrow there is much   
to be said on all these matters, "issues, like   
"No rest for the weary. (And yet--why not?)   
Feeling under orders is a way of showing up,   
but stepping on Earth--she's not going to.   
Ten shades of pleasing himself brings us to tomorrow   
evening and will be back for more. I disagree   
with you completely but couldn't be prouder   
and fonder of you. So drink up. Feel good for two.   

I do it in a lot of places. Subfusc El Dorado   
is only one that I know something about.   
Others are recently lost cities   
where we used to live--they keep the names   
we knew, sometimes. I do it in a lot of places.   
Brash brats offer laughing advice,   
as though anything I cared about could be difficult   
or complicated now. That's the rub. Gusts of up   
to forty-five miles an hour will be dropping in later   
on tonight. No reason not to. So point at the luck   
we know about. Living is a meatloaf sandwich.   
I had a good time up there.





Leave the Hand In
 

Furthermore, Mr. Tuttle used to have to run in the streets.   
Now, each time friendship happens, they're fully booked.   
Sporting with amaryllis in the shade is all fine and good,   
but when your sparring partner gets there first   
you wonder if it was all worth it. "Yes, why do it?   
I'm on hold. It will take quite a lot for this music   
to grow on me. I meant no harm. I've helped him   
from getting stuck before. Dumb thing. All my appetites are friendly.   
Children too are free to go and come as they please.   
I ask you only to choose between us, then shut down this election.   
But don't reveal too much of your hand at any given time.   
Then up and pipes the major, leave the hand in,   
or change the vows. The bold, enduring menace of courtship is upon us   
like the plague, and none of us can say what trouble   
will be precipitated once it has had its way with us.   
Our home is marshland. After dinner was wraparound.   
You got a tender little look at it.   

Outside, it never did turn golden.





Boundary Issues
 

Here in life, they would understand.   
How could it be otherwise? We had groped too,   
unwise, till the margin began to give way,   
at which point all was sullen, or lost, or both.   

Now it was time, and there was nothing for it.   

We had a good meal, I and my friend,   
slurping from the milk pail, grabbing at newer vegetables.   
Yet life was a desert. Come home, in good faith.   
You can still decide to. But it wanted warmth.   
Otherwise ruse and subtlety would become impossible   
in the few years or hours left to us. "Yes, but . . .   
The iconic beggars shuffled off   too. I told you,   
once a breach emerges it will become a chasm   
before anyone's had a chance to waver. A dispute   
on the far side of town erupts into a war   
in no time at all, and ends as abruptly. The tendency to heal   
sweeps all before it, into the arroyo, the mine shaft,   
into whatever pocket you were contemplating. And the truly lost   
make up for it. It's always us that has to pay.   

I have a suggestion to make: draw the sting out   
as probingly as you please. Plaster the windows over   
with wood pulp against the noon gloom proposing its enigmas,   
its elixirs. Banish truth-telling. 
That's the whole point, as I understand it.   
Each new investigation rebuilds the urgency,   
like a sand rampart. And further reflection undermines it,   
causing its eventual collapse. We could see all that   
from a distance, as on a curving abacus, in urgency mode   
from day one, but by then dispatches hardly mattered.   
It was camaraderie, or something like it, that did,   
poring over us like we were papyri, hoping to find one   
correct attitude sketched on the gaslit air, night's friendly takeover.





Here I Am, Lord
 

The ribbed black of the umbrella   
is an argument for the existence of God,   

that little shelter   
we carry with us   

and may forget   
beside a chair   

in a committee meeting   
we did not especially want to attend.   

What a beautiful word, umbrella.   
A shade to be opened.   

Like a bat's wing, scalloped.   
It shivers.   

A drum head   
beaten by the silver sticks   

of rain   
and I do not have mine   

and so the rain showers me.





Coyote, with Mange
 

Oh, Unreadable One, why   
have you done this to your dumb creature?   
Why have you chosen to punish the coyote   

rummaging for chicken bones in the dung heap,   
shucked the fur from his tail   
and fashioned it into a scabby cane?   

Why have you denuded his face,   
tufted it, so that when he turns he looks   
like a slow child unhinging his face in a smile?   

The coyote shambles, crow-hops, keeps his head low,   
and without fur, his now visible pizzle   
is a sad red protuberance,   

his hind legs the backward image   
of a bandy-legged grandfather, stripped.   
Why have you unhoused this wretch   

from his one aesthetic virtue,   
taken from him that which kept him   
from burning in the sun like a man?   

Why have you pushed him from his world into mine,   
stopped him there and turned his ear   
toward my warning shout?





Waumandee
 

A man with binoculars   
fixed a shape in the field   
and we stopped and saw   

the albino buck browsing   
in the oats--white dash   
on a page of green,   

flick of a blade   
cutting paint to canvas.   
It dipped its head   

and green effaced the white,   
bled onto the absence that   
the buck was--animal erasure.   

Head up again, its sugar legs   
pricked the turf, pink   
antler prongs brushed at flies.   

Here in a field was the imagined world   
made visible--a mythical beast   
filling its rumen with clover   

until all at once it startled,   
flagged its bright tail--   
auf Wiedersehen, surrender--   

and leapt away--   
a white tooth   
in the closing mouth of the woods.





The Corn Baby
 

They brought it. It was brought   
from the field, the last sheaf, the last bundle   

the latest and most final armful. Up up   
over the head, hold it, hold it high it held   

the gazer's gaze, it held hope, did hold it.   
Through the stubble of September, on shoulders   

aloft, hardly anything, it weighed, like a sparrow,   
it was said, something winged, hollow, though   

pulsing, freed from the field   
where it flailed in wind, where it waited, wanted   

to be found and bound with cord. It had   
limbs, it had legs. And hands. It had fingers.   

Fingers and a face peering from the stalks,   
shuttered in the grain, closed, though just a kernel   

a shut corm. They brought him and autumn   
rushed in, tossed its cape of starlings,   

tattered the frost-spackled field.





A Gift
 

Who is that creature   
and who does he want?   
Me, I trust. I do not   
attempt to call out his   
name for fear he will   
tread on me. What do   
you believe, he asks.   

That we all want to be   
alone, I reply, except when   
we do not; that the world   
was open to my sorrow   
and ate most of it; that   
today is a gift and I am   
ready to receive you.





Ideas
 

I was the lonely one in whom   
they swarmed in the millions.   
I was their creature and I   
was grateful. I could sleep   
when I wanted.   

I lived a divided   
existence in sleepdreams   
that lit up a silence as dreadful   
as that of the moon. I have   
an overly-precise recall of   

those solitary years before   
I opened the curtain and drew   
upon a universe of want that made   
me so strong I could crack   
spines of books with one hand.





Fox in the Landscape
 

Tulip, you   
Bled on my green rug.   

A jungle-red petal   
Where my little kits   

Rollick, fallen like a warning--   

Yesterday I sat outside   
In the returned sun   

Trying to make more   
Friends; after all these years   

To think of yourself   
Snapped, the sweet sap   

Tremoring between   
States of ice and melt.   

An old love wrote to me   
From his wife's country place   

To say he had been hunting there   
And could appreciate the hounds;   

In a white coat he is closely   
Setting people's bones, opening   

Their backs with the hands   
I knew   

The cancellated paths   
Of saying no or yes: I could have fallen 

To a fearing of the little foxes lately   
Come into the yard   

(There is so little I know about what to do)   
But I let them be.





In Me as the Swans
 

Not embittered   
even while freezing   
to the ice of their own lakes.   

The night I was leaving for Madrid   
into the noisy party a dazzling   
friend-of-a-friend walked in: I want so much   
(as a couple of kids on the dance floor want)   
to slow the tempo, hold there longer,   
to feel that seedly longing   
to be pressed into the soil,   
or that little lift the mothers get   
when stocking larders, even now,   
vestige of the primitive urge   
to be provided for and to provide.   

          I went alone to see that balcony   
in Verona, after the Roman dramas and luxuries   
above the Spanish Steps, when an elegant   
footman brought a pack of Reds on a silver   
tray and all but smoked them for you;   
after your towels had warmed in London's best   
hotel, whose name I can't remember and am kind of glad,   
glad now for the rest of empty August and   
the convent hostel's eleven o'clock curfew,   
glad now when I go to the distinguished dinners   
that I have stood alone   
wondering at illuminated books,   
looking at Woolf's spectacles under glass   
or standing under Bourgeois's giant spider   
at the Tate--at times the best kept universe   
was my own, no interceding docents   
or guided tours, but a riverine serendipitous   
wandering--waif, naf. 

                   I liked the light enormously so why   
did I obey the bell that called me in?





Landscape with Horse Named Popcorn
 

The hummingbird hovers over bougainvillea, darting in and out   
of blossoms as the bride throws   

her corset among laughter and waving hands. Seeing you, glass in hand, sunlight   
piercing the punch bowl's crystal, I remember   

the horse, an Appaloosa, the white and gray markings   
like clouds, cumulus, one   

later on his grave, the 2X4 cross with name   
above a swell of land that could bring   
a man to his knees,   

or make him look up at fumbling shapes, cotton-fumed   
and slow. I can hear the screeching   

still. The colt had grabbed a turkey nesting in scrub oak, and prancing,   
shook it in his mouth as we ran   

reaching toward black feathers--then the ne   
spray of blood--until beyond adrenaline we began laughing, 

as laughing now, brushing confetti away, you hand   
the bride flowers, narcissi, their green throats pushing up   
from wet stones in a jar.





Apiary 40
 

The humble sense of being alive   
under the towering sun   
fills the nectary and ripens apricots   
down to the last one,   
if Mnemosyne wakens from apathy   
each moment. It is the soft burly sound   
of a bee tumbled in fritillary,   
is it not?   
But if memory, as if to illustrate   
the mind was not yours to have,   
the mind was not given,   
fails us, leaving us in our underpants   
in the garden, should we not   
hate the garden,   
or the woman whose garden   
it is? And sunlight. Thunder.   
Rain. Hardened in heart against   
what earth compels and seizes,   
goddamning, goddamned rain.





Lines for Winter
 

Poor muse, north wind, or any god   
who blusters bleak across the lake   
and sows the earth earth-deep with ice.   
A hoar of fur stung across the vines:   
here the leaves in full flush, here   
abandoned to four and farther winds.   
Bless us, any god who crabs the apples   
and seeds the leaf and needle evergreen.   
What whispered catastrophe, winter.   
What a long night, beyond the lamplight,   
the windows and the frost-ferned glass.   
Bless the traveler and the hearth he travels to.   
Bless our rough hands, wind-scabbed lips,   
bless this our miscreant psalm.





At Chartres
 

Who wielded the chisel   
at the left portal,   
south porch, the scene   

of Theo chained,   
naked to the waist, leaning in   
to the brutal hand   

of what looks to be   
an even younger boy?   
What man carved stone   

to mimic flesh   
as it would look inside   
the torture of its flensing?   

How he must have held   
the scene in his own   
mind, thought it back   

to the act itself,   
modeling the lines   
with his own limbs   

so he would know   
both how a body   
bends in pain, and how   

a hand extends the flayer's rake.





"Embrace Them All
 

Parc Georges-Brassens, Paris
Most afternoons, I'd run laps through Parc Brassens   
where grows the second smallest vineyard   

I have ever seen, and where those silver,   
pruned-back stalks looked blunt,   

strung-out on wires, and mostly dead   
all winter. That was how I saw them.   

That's all I expected. Even in the cold,   
I'd see a guy my age there, once a week,   

playing his guitar. He'd sit next to the bench   
where I'd be stretching. He rarely spoke--   

just to ask if I'd like a song--   
until the week before I left for good.   

I was sitting at the top of a hill   
about a hundred feet away from where   

if you stand tiptoe you can see the Eiffel Tower.   
He sat too close to me. We spoke of many things.   

Then he suggested we go at it right there,   
on the ground, under the sun. This is how   

one lives who knows that she will die:   
rolling in the arms of anyone when she can--   

rolling in the arms of a musician--aware   
that no one cares much what we do 

in little knolls behind reedy forsythia,   
in the middle of a Tuesday, in the middle   

of living. And I would know now   
how he felt, and the ground against me,   

and whether he was rough or sweet.   
And what is possible would widen every hour.   

Oh, but me, I thought I was immortal.





Rakestreet
 

Would you believe it, I got lost again   
And all roads led to Rakestreet. Which was which,   
The short road or the long? A girl of ten   
Behind her counter, drew me a thumbnail sketch   

Of space in time. The Big House was, she said,   
Five minutes away, or seven hundred years.   
Nephin, nebulous in its hat of cloud,   
A reference point. I would never get out of here   

Unless I fell in love with my condition--   
Rakestreet, with its boy behind the bar,   
Its sweatshop, and its permanent television   
In the background, rumbling from afar   

Of war and worldly sex, greed and ambition,   
While the dead slept under lichened stone   
Behind Kilmurry chapel. Older than religion,   
Older than history, this quiet need to atone   

By staying local, once at the very least,   
For an hour, a day, a lifetime. Marry the girl,   
Buy up the stock, become one with the deceased--   
Let Crossmolina and the Big House world   

Be damned to its own eternity, Lough Conn   
Forever signaled, never come upon,   
Lose itself, like the reason I came   
In the first place, and my aboriginal name.





Deep Ulster
 

It was there, the elemental center,   
All the time. Eternally present, repeating itself   
Like seasons, where the times and dates   
For swallows and household fires are written down,   

The grouse are counted, the quotas of stocked rainbows.   
All that love of order, for its own sake.   
Only the hill-farms, and the high sheep country   
Above politics--the enormous relief   

Up there, as the dialect names of skies   
Return, along with their clouds, and the old knowledge   
Opens the mind again. To dream, to just potter   
In the yard, to fiddle with local stations   

In the kitchen, where news that is no news   
Finally, at last, fills up the years   
With pure existence. Lit from beneath   
The fields are evenings long, the tree by the house   

Where Vladimir and Estragon kept vigil   
With the stillness of commando and insurgent   
Frightens no one. Slow through the air   
A heron, shouldering aside the weight of the world,   

Is making for its colonies, coevals   
In a state plantation . . .   
                                  Nowhere but here   
In the high right hand of Ireland, do the weather fronts   
Give way so slowly, to such ambivalent light.





The Park
 

Because anyone sitting still attracts desire,   
Even this will not be given you, the park   
In June, the silence of a bench at eleven o'clock   

On a Monday morning, or four on a Thursday afternoon.   
Someone will drift toward you, unattached   
And lonely. The spell will be broken, the wrong word said.   

It is cool, but there is no death in the few token leaves   
That must have come down last night, in the rain that freshened,   
The tree-smell that remains. For this season there is no name,   

Not summer, and none of the months of the year--   
A something inside you. Search your mind   
For the green arboriferous Word the boys and girls swing out of   

Like a tree, and the lovers   
On the grass in tantric mode, in an ecstasy   
Of untouching, and the human buddhas, legs infolded, reading.   

Branches, sheer translucent leaves--   
You would die to get under them forever, if it were given you,   
The park, on this, a day like any other day,   

And not the knowledge of everyone ever met   
Who will come upon you, sooner or later,   
If only you stay here. No, not people, or the walkways   

Made in another century, or the murmur of the great city   
Everywhere in the distance, but this breathing-space   
Where the void no longer terrible   

But to be relaxed in, the depressions   
Which anyway here are mild, incoming from the west,   
Slow-acting, chronic, lifelong not acute 

Are there to be sat through, waited out   
On a damp bench, as a man sweeps up around you   
And the sun comes out in real time, stealing over the ground.





What I Have
 

Twelve dollars sixty cents,   
& the fact that there is no blood no storm   
can't wash into dirt, that the time for these words   
             is already ended,   
that for all the rain that has been here before   
so have I.   
          & there is less water in the world   
than a famous woman once said, & I know that,   
          & that the stars in the river   
also are real I also know, for they disappear also   
& refuse also to be touched. & I have touched   

            bare things, & it works--   
it can be the sole unbraided moment in a life--   
but even so, what better days look like to me is still   
            the tiny gore   
of heartbreak, & long walks with small shoes   
            that can't be taken off,   
& schools in a city I love that put molded cages   
            over their clocks,   
because that works too to remind us   
we are not ready. & the worst of all is anything that   
            stays as it is   

                     when touched.   
At lunchtime a woman famous for her ability   
to praise the ineffable   
                      says she can't believe anyone returns   
to where they came from.   
            But of course they do. In fact   
some do nothing else. & what is it they leave behind?   
            Perhaps not the meaning of time,   
but the time of meaning, & the fact that whatever   
happens, tomorrow   
                      will change it.





Captains in Captivity
 

She came to see him in the safehouse   
          to interface   
without biography or autobiography.   
I am, she told him, the only one here   
who cares whether you continue   
to live. I care,   
          he said, but it was formulaic.   
His propensity, not a precondition.   
          The ground beneath his feet   
smelled of everything   

          other men's feet   
had ever ground into it. It was blank   
for all horrors, all aftermaths. A fly   
          dazzled in a sunbeam   
through the windowpane. Like water,   
he seemed to say,   
          & she agreed with him.   
I would like water, he repeated. She   

pretended not to hear him,   
because that was the sort of slippage   
          that could save him   
& suddenly she was not against it.   
He could continue to live   
if he could continue to mean himself   
or anything   
          as poorly as he had just then.





General William Booth Enters Into Heaven
 

[To be sung to the tune of The Blood of the Lamb with indicated instrument]
[BASS DRUM BEATEN LOUDLY] 
Booth led boldly with his big bass drum--   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)   
The Saints smiled gravely and they said: "He's come.   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)   
Walking lepers followed, rank on rank,   
Lurching bravoes from the ditches dank,   
Drabs from the alleyways and drug fiends pale--   
Minds still passion-ridden, soul-powers frail:--   
Vermin-eaten saints with mouldy breath,   
Unwashed legions with the ways of Death--   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)   

[BANJOS] 
Every slum had sent its half-a-score   
The round world over. (Booth had groaned for more.)   
Every banner that the wide world flies   
Bloomed with glory and transcendent dyes.   
Big-voiced lasses made their banjos bang,   
Tranced, fanatical they shrieked and sang:--   
"Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?   
Hallelujah! It was queer to see   
Bull-necked convicts with that land make free.   
Loons with trumpets blowed a blare, blare, blare   
On, on upward thro' the golden air!   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)   

[BASS DRUM SLOWER AND SOFTER] 
Booth died blind and still by Faith he trod,   
Eyes still dazzled by the ways of God.   
Booth led boldly, and he looked the chief   
Eagle countenance in sharp relief,   
Beard a-flying, air of high command   
Unabated in that holy land.   

[SWEET FLUTE MUSIC] 
Jesus came from out the court-house door,   
Stretched his hands above the passing poor.   
Booth saw not, but led his queer ones there   
Round and round the mighty court-house square.   
Yet in an instant all that blear review   
Marched on spotless, clad in raiment new.   
The lame were straightened, withered limbs uncurled   
And blind eyes opened on a new, sweet world.   

[BASS DRUM LOUDER] 
Drabs and vixens in a flash made whole!   
Gone was the weasel-head, the snout, the jowl!   
Sages and sibyls now, and athletes clean,   
Rulers of empires, and of forests green!   

[GRAND CHORUS OF ALL INSTRUMENTS. 
TAMBOURINES TO THE FOREGROUND] 
The hosts were sandalled, and their wings were fire!   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)   
But their noise played havoc with the angel-choir.   
(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)   
O shout Salvation! It was good to see   
Kings and Princes by the Lamb set free.   
The banjos rattled and the tambourines   
Jing-jing-jingled in the hands of Queens.   

[REVERENTLY SUNG. NO INSTRUMENTS] 
And when Booth halted by the curb for prayer   
He saw his Master thro' the flag-filled air.   
Christ came gently with a robe and crown   
For Booth the soldier, while the throng knelt down.   
He saw King Jesus. They were face to face,   
And he knelt a-weeping in that holy place.   
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?





Library
 

Paulatim lachrymas rerum experentia tersit.  Petrarch
Father's books lying on the living-room floor 
Must be divided into threes: art history, 
Classical letters and, left from my days here, 
Unsteady stacks of quasi-educational lore 
That show yellowing Geographic scientists 
Perennially lost in rain forest mists. 
An instant choice will cull some from the rest 
So they may become mine--a banausic test. 

Prewar light glimmers in the apartment: 
A shadowplay that summons an adolescence 
Of slammed doors and risible nothings 
Hurled at retreating parental backs 
--The most telling blows always sotto voce-- 
As I stormed and wept and read in silence. 
Now, standing again in silence, I stare 
At a word trove given two sons to share. 

Some are dated in the first blank page: 1 
January 1938 this reads, as if a resolution 
Made (and kept?); this ruddy leather edition 
States simply Property of--with no name given. 
I gesture toward the emptiness of gifts 
Prematurely bestowed in illness's ruin 
And blow dust off an enfeebled spine, 
Filling lungs with belletristic grime. 

It's all some forgotten chore from a childhood 
The hall mirror charitably declares was good. 
Pictures of other libraries fill my head: 
Weighty tomes I hauled to girlfriends' walkups, 
Barely unpacked before again in boxes; 
Or Sophoclean dramas, lost to ancient fires, 
Which exist in name only; or that fable 
Of an infinitely circular Library of Babel 

Borges saw as self-referential: nooks, 
Corridors, dead ends, twisting stairwells: 
Bibliographic cargo cults and infidels. 
In his bed, dreaming of a golden age of looks 
And cars, booze and fine clothes, my father snores 
And chokes and comes to. . . . Sunlight pours 
Into empty bookcases. Where in hell are they?! 
If memory then corrects, questions stay 

And, refracting off walls, gather numb force 
As I read a volume plucked at random 
Only to start up when hoarse ripples burn 
My innermost ear: Where, where, where? 
Soon my father will awaken to find no air. 
One tattered cover shows a boy's ray-gun 
Pointed to the sun: the future, that much is clear. 
Somewhere where this library can cohere. 

Nearly finished, I stumble on Petrarch's Epistles 
And, apropos of age, find: In that passing, I shall 
Not seem myself: another brow, other habits, a new form 
Of the mind, another voice sounding. . . . Father whistles 
Down the hallways for his lackadaisical firstborn. 
Little by little, experience wipes dry our tears. 
The job's done--leaving me to calculate the years 
I withheld my love, and the years I've left to mourn.





Hexameter
 

Hold, memory, a vision out of Greece: 
The west wind breathes a ripening breath 
As each pear, pendant and golden, brushes 
Another, where four tilled acres glisten 
Winter and summer: fig, olive, currant, 
And the heavy succulent pomegranate 
--Sunstruck for the plucker's hand. 
All this a stranger sees, palm on lintel, 
Sees the stately women of the royal rooms 
Murmuring over linen, looms humming; 
Sees boys, on pedestals, shine torches 
Which fire the eyes of Alkinos's hounds. 

So much of heroism wondrously found 
(Like a glinting pebble in a child's hand, 
Borne upward to imagination's shallows),   
As I'd gaze at snow blanketing West End, 
Hearing the story my father burnished 
Over a month of nights, so that the voyage 
Of the telling faded into the hours lived 
Beside that voice--whiskey rough--again 
Taking up the exile's lament: hekatomb, 
Distaff, honeyed wine . . . Some bleary god 
Come down from heaven's height, as snow 
Descends on elms and, beyond our window, 
Odysseus, beggared and unknown, moves 
Toward the great bow of gnarled revenge. 
Father, I stand beside you now, your right arm! 
Pitch pine torches reveal a stranger's son 
Holding still-thrumming wood in his hand.





The Kings Question
 

In memory of Nancy Tow Spiegel
Before he put his important question to an oracle, 
Croesus planned to test all the famous soothsayers, 
Sending runners half around the world, to Delphi, 
Dodona, Amphiarius, Branchidae, and Ammon, 
So as to determine the accuracy of their words; 
His challenge: not to say anything of his future 

But rather what he was doing in his capital, Sardis 
(Eating an unlikely meal of lamb and tortoise, 
Exactly one hundred days after messengers had set out). 
This posed a challenge, then, of far space not of time: 
Of seeing past dunes and rock fortresses; of flying, 
Freighted, above caravans and seas; of sightedness, 

As it were, in the present construed as a darkened room. 
Croesus of Lydia sought by this means to gauge 
The unplumbed limits of what each oracle knew, 
Hesitant to entrust his fate to any unable to divine 
Lamb and tortoise stewing in a bronze pot. 
When only the Pythia of Apollo at Delphi correctly 

Answered from her cleft, her tripod just the lens 
For seeing into the royal ego, she put his mind to rest, 
But not before speaking in her smoke-stung voice: 
I count the grains of sand on the beach and the sea's depth; 
I know the speech of the dumb and I hear those without voice. 
We know this because those present wrote it down. 

Of the King's crucial questions, however, there is nothing. 
We have no word. The histories are silent. 
                                                                My analyst, 
Whose office on Madison was narrow as an anchorite's cave, 
Would sit behind me as I stared up at her impassive ceiling, 
As the uptown buses slushed all the way to Harlem, 
And I would recount, with many hesitations and asides, 

The play I was starring in, whose Acts were as yet 
Fluid, though the whole loomed tragically enough. 
She would listen, bent over knitting, or occasionally note 
Some fact made less random by my tremulous soliloquy. 
When much later I heard of her death after long cancer, 
I walked across town and stood, in front of her building, 

Trying to resurrect those afternoons that became the years 
We labored together toward a time without neurosis, 
When I might work and raise a family and find peace. 
Find, if not happiness exactly, some surcease from pain. 
What question had I failed to ask, when the chance was mine? 
When she, who knew me so well, could have answered? 

Let just one of those quicksilver hours be returned to me, 
With my knowledge now of the world, and not a boy's, 
With all that I have become a lighted room. One hour 
To ask the question that burned, once, in a King's throat: 
The question of all questions, the true source and center, 
Without which a soul must make do, clap hands and sing.





Estrangement in Athens
 

Mount Olympus held nothing for them. 
No occasion of theirs could provoke 
Magniloquent debate. Nor act require 
That attic of gods to come swooping 
Onto the field, swaying the battle. 
Only the great booming of the ferry 
As it shouldered alongside the pier; 
Only the waitress counting their 
Saucers: it was this April morning 
That swung them by their heels. 
What was missing was the impersonal, 
The fated, a visionary marble address, 
The goddess skimming over blue water 
To whisper good news, or some stud, 
Swan, or bull brimming with light. 
Not a wingd foot. Only Love, 
Recently decamped, hovered above 
The table, ready to be splendid. 
But their ten years' war had ended.





Chekhovs "The Student (April, 1894)
 

For hours now the Last Supper has been over, 
And the beating almost over, and morning's cry 
Yet to be heard by the workmen in the courtyard 
Warming themselves by the hasty fire, and Peter, 
Near the agony in the garden, feeling something 
Terrible happening, blinking back stale sleep, 
Peter turns his face from strangers' stares. 
"This man also was with Jesus. The others 
Slowly turning toward him with cold interest, 
And his own voice, thick-tongued: "I do not know him. 

That the cock crows not then but at the third No 
Must tell us much about the nature of faith, 
How it leans on separations, how it robes simple 
Gestures--a hand waving from an open window-- 
With deferral, as if real knowledge only comes after, 
As though Peter could only see what he'd done 
Upon going from the high priest's courtyard 
And, all alone, weeping bitterly in the dawn. 
That much we can understand, but why then 
Does Chekhov revisit this known, hard ground 

With a half-frozen student who, on his way back 
From a failed hunt, thinks how this same chill 
Easter wind must have blown in Rurik's age 
And scourged the hungry poor in the years 
Of Peter the Great and Ivan the Terrible? 
Wind, raw wind, hunger, icy needles of rain . . . 
The same as then--until, coming on two widows, 
A huge, shapeless old woman in a man's overcoat 
And her putty-faced daughter washing a kettle, 
The student asks if he might share their fire, 

Saying, as he does, that St. Peter had on such 
A night warmed himself before a fire, on such 
A cold, extraordinarily long and terrible night. 
Murmuring welcomes, they bring him inside, 
And soon he finds himself describing in detail 
That part of the gospel which is Peter's betrayal: 
". . . thus I imagine it: the garden deathly still 
And very dark, and in the silence came 
Sounds of muffled sobbing-- Here his account 
Breaks off when the absently-smiling Vasilissa 

Suddenly weeps, burying her eyes in her apron; 
Whereupon her daughter, herself bowed down 
By sickness and filth, blushes and turns away. 
The student, for all his theology, is speechless. 
There's nothing for it now but to step out 
With empty game-bag and find his moonlit 
Way back home across the ancient marsh. 
Only then does he see in the waterlogged 
Meadow, well beyond the river's sedges, 
Something remarkable: a high-walled garden 

Looming green against a background of sand. 
Nineteen hundred years crossed in heartbeats! 
In that kindled instant all the world's travails 
Drop from his shoulders. Just twenty-two, 
He has found the very quick of faith. 
Gone are hunger, sleet and useless words. Gone! 
Ah, we leave him there at century's end, 
Before he has returned to his village 
--And all that returning would surely mean-- 
In this, the briefest of the master's stories.





The Last Canto
 

In the garrulous present 
Threadbare nouns find 
What raiment's left 
From forefathers 

Who perhaps struck poses 
But wrote of frenzy 
Out of deepest urgency 
Hammering voices 

In no dumbfounded age. 
Theirs the grace 
Of unfaltering 
Fealty to the word. 

Yet then I picture Pound 
Prematurely stilled 
By his own tongue 
--Tempus tacendi. 

Did he ever revisit 
The barbed floodlit quad 
Where bareheaded he'd 
Stood in all weather 

Mouthing surreal Greek, 
Fashioning a rhythm 
Out of life's ruin, 
That life he would unspeak 

Half a lifetime later 
Arriving on the tarmac 
Of Eisenhower Italy, 
Breath caught in the throat? 

I heft his burdened book 
Only to let it drop 
--A stoneweight dropping down 
Well's jaggy darkness 

That anyhow comes back 
In stonecold dialect: 
Pisa! A pure echo 
Purged of memory. 

On my lap his poems' 
Esoteric call 
Has no words at all 
Or just those selfsame ones 

Quarried from a rock 
--Red and ocher bison 
Emblaze the solitude 
Of an old draughtsman 

Who long hours daubs 
In Altamira's shade: 
Let those I love try to forgive 
What I have made.





In the Cannery the Porpoise Soul
 

In the cannery the porpoise soul 
& the shadow fins of spirit boats lie awake 
the hundred hooks & flying reels 
one harpoon 
& the silver fleshing in the nets 

the mayor is waiting/counting scales 
dreaming new quotas & tuna coasts 
(under the table blood & payrolls 
swim to the shores on a crucifix of oil) 

in the cannery the porpoise soul 
steals a dagger for the engines throat 
tuna fins etch an X 
on the green stone of the ships floor 

there are documents with worker sweat 
files & rolled sleeve salt 
a spear of sails & anchor years 
(lost) 
inside the shoulders & against the ropes 
(somehow) 
a policy gunned the waves back 
before the porpoise sea was born

Let us gather in a flourishing way
with sunluz grains abriendo los cantos 
que cargamos cada da   
en el young pasto nuestro cuerpo 
para regalar y dar feliz perlas pearls 
of corn flowing rboles de vida en las cuatro esquinas 
let us gather in a flourishing way 
contentos llenos de fuerza to vida 
giving nacimientos to fragrant ros   
dulces frescos verdes turquoise strong 
carne de nuestros hijos rainbows 
let us gather in a flourishing way 
en la luz y en la carne of our heart to toil 
tranquilos in fields of blossoms 
juntos to stretch los brazos 
tranquilos with the rain en la maana 
temprana estrella on our forehead 
cielo de calor and wisdom to meet us 
where we toil siempre 
in the garden of our struggle and joy 
let us offer our hearts a saludar our guila rising

piedras nopales plumas piercing bursting 
figs and aguacates 
ripe mariposa fields and mares claros 
of our face 
to breathe todos en el camino blessing 
seeds to give to grow maiztln 
en las manos de nuestro amor





War Voyeurs
 

for Clara Fraser
I do not understand why men make war.

Is it because artillery is the most stoic example 
of what flesh can become? 
Is it because the military plan is the final map 
drawn by the wisest hunter? 
Is it because the neutron ray is the invincible finger 
no one will disobey? 

or 

Is it because the flood of blood is the proper penance 
workers must pay for failing tribute at the prescribed 
hour? 

I do not understand why men make war. 

Is it because when death is multiple and expanding, there 
among the odd assemblages, arbitrary and unnamed, there 
among the shrivelled mountains, distorted and hollow, there 
among the liquid farms and cities, cold and sallow, there 
among the splintered bones of children, women, men and cattle 
there and only there, the eerie head of power is being born? 

Is it because submission is the only gesture to be rehearsed, 
to be dressed, to be modeled, to be cast, to be chosen 
in the one and only one drama to be staged in the theater of   
this world, where everyone must act with the backbone humbled 
with the mascara of bondage, with the lipstick of slaves under 
the light of gentle assassination with applause piercing the ground 
forever? 

or 

Is it because war is the secret room of all things to be kept   
sealed and contained, to be conquered and renamed woman 
enclosed by an empire of walls, vaults, hinges and locks with 
the hot key that men and only men must possess for an eternal 
evening to visit and contemplate, to snap open a favorite window 
and gaze at the calibrated murder as lovers of beauty?





I Am Merely Posing for a Photograph
 

I am merely posing for a photograph.
Remember, when the Nomenclature 
stops you, tell them that--"Sirs, he was posing 
for my camera, that is all. . . . yes, that may just work. 

My eyes: 
clear, hazel like my father's, gaze across the sea, my hands at my side, my   
legs spread apart in the wet sands, my pants crumpled, torn, withered, my   
shirt in rags, see-through in places, no buttons, what a luxury, buttons, I   
laugh a little, my tongue slips and licks itself, almost, I laugh, licks itself   
from side to side, the corners of my mouth, if only I could talk like I used   
to, giggle under moonlight, to myself, my arms destitute, shrunken, I   
hadn't noticed, after so many years sifting through rubble stars, rubble toys,   
rubble crosses, after so many decades beseeching rubble breasts--pretend I   
came to swim, I am here by accident, 

like you. 

My face to one side. 
Listen to gray-white bells of rubble, the list 
goes on--the bones, hearts, puffed intestines, 
stoned genitalia, teeth, again I forget how 
to piece all this together, scraps, so many scraps, 
lines and holes. 

The white gray rubble light blinds me, 
wait, I just thought--what if this is not visible, 
what if all this is not visible. 

Listen here, closely: 
I am speaking of the amber thighs 
still spilling nectar on the dust fleece across Gaza, 
the mountains, the spliced wombs across Israel, Syria. 

The amber serums cut across all boundaries, 
they smell incense, bread, honey--the color 
of my mother's hands, her flesh, the shrapnel is the same color 
the propellers churn.





Let Me Tell You What a Poem Brings
 

for Charles Fishman
Before you go further, 
let me tell you what a poem brings, 
first, you must know the secret, there is no poem 
to speak of, it is a way to attain a life without boundaries, 
yes, it is that easy, a poem, imagine me telling you this, 
instead of going day by day against the razors, well, 
the judgments, all the tick-tock bronze, a leather jacket 
sizing you up, the fashion mall, for example, from 
the outside you think you are being entertained, 
when you enter, things change, you get caught by surprise, 
your mouth goes sour, you get thirsty, your legs grow cold 
standing still in the middle of a storm, a poem, of course, 
is always open for business too, except, as you can see, 
it isn't exactly business that pulls your spirit into 
the alarming waters, there you can bathe, you can play, 
you can even join in on the gossip--the mist, that is, 
the mist becomes central to your existence.





Grafik
 

for Toms Mendoza-Harrell & Lauro Flores
I cut / / / / /

I multiply everyday images. I apply an aluminum point. 
To the landscape. 
To the sentence. 
To the photo. 
To the figure. 
To the word. 

And suddenly, with a slight tremor of eyes, vertebrae and fingers, I 
destroy everything that exists. 

Through the years, I've rebuilt the cells, uncovered the signs of the cold, 
immaculate, academic vestibules and of the dead lips and histories in the 
metropolitan streets. 

My surgery is criminal. 

No one has been able to identify the skeletons, the remains, the thousand 
scattered nerves of personages I've gathered in order to bring this figure 
back to life. The scars are numberless and invisible. 

Who would suspect a grafik artist? 
Who would suspect this gray table as a chamber of murders? 
Instruments: 
   --The pencil sleeping with its yellow blanket and rubber crown. 
   --A magazine of memories, smiling women, men's suits and watches like 
      drops, like science. 
   --Tubes of smothered ink sounding like small seas pounding a universe of    
      plastic. 
   --A photo of a Chamula woman looking through these windows toward 
      the Mission. 
   --Watercolors: French Ultramarine, Emerald Green and Windsor Violet. 
   --Matches thin friends identical soldiers with their red helmets thinking. 
   --Dictionaries in Portuguese, Spanish and German, white pages beasts 
      nobody hears moaning. 
   --The priest lantern praying with its head pointing toward the floor in   
      front of a fierce wall. 
   --Solemn archives organized by syllables, breaths, laughs and love with X. 
   --A book about an artist: The Fabulous Life of Diego Rivera, printed in New 
      York where they listen to the wind falling from the tallest building. 

And the X-acto knives. Triangular. The beautiful blades / / / / / 

Every night cars cruise the streets of 24th and Mission. A woman from San   
Jos drives a blue Chevy with smoked windows. Estela. She has reddish   
hair. Tight brows and dark eyes desiring everything but this street that   
ends in eight blocks: Potrero Avenue. She'll have to turn. But she won't.   
She won't go back to the home of twenty years and her father who pretends   
to play Santa by Agustn Lara on his old guitar and the mother organizing a   
Jehovah's Witnesses' meeting. Estela will leave the car parked between   
Harrison Street and Alabama in San Francisco. She'll walk aimlessly in the   
warmth of the produce stores, into St. Peter's church, by the Galera de la   
Raza, China Books, the bakery at La Victoria. She'll walk in the night with   
her eyes burning, seeing him laughing, the young man in his black box   
apartment, laughing, laughing, laughing like a little man. 

The little man laughs. It's an apartment of marriage and fists. The   
wife-beater laughs in his easy chair. Next to his bed he sees the anxious   
note. He focuses on the signature with the E broken in three places. 

He looks at the stained and unmade sheets, the dull curtains, the crushed   
cigarettes and the ashes. The black-and-white television announces a sale   
of living room furniture. With his can of beer he observes. Smokes. Thinks. 

Within a week or two they'll take his cousin to San Quentin prison, again.   
The last time he saw him he was a gardener at a college. 

He imagines Estela coming home. He imagines and drinks calmly. Makes the   
bed. Turns off the television and turns on the fm. He amuses himself in   
that space or cube floating above the city. 
Estela walks north on the Avenue. 

P / O / T / R / E / R / O 

Grafiks require precise knives. 

      On that day 
      When you came to bathe me 
      I sweated that stink 
      That only the anesthetized 
      Can sweat. 

      You sponged my skin 
      Cleaned my hair and 
      Seeming to ignore 
      My stunned and shriveled genitals 
      You nonetheless bathed them . . . 
               --michael ramsey-prez 

Randi finds himself in a hospital in Los Angeles or maybe further south, in   
San Diego. I think his parents are from Arizona. He's very ill. He's in a room   
with a red sign hanging from the doorknob. 

I / S / O / L / A / T / I / O / N 

His liver is bloated, skin yellowed, hair long and greasy. Weakness   
consumes him night after night. He can't speak, tires easily. But he can   
hear. He hears the white heels of the doctors and nurses running to the   
rooms of the dying. He hears footsteps fluttering like doves over the floor   
or like the leaves of fever falling from the roof of hell. 

It's eleven o'clock at night. He hears the abandoned man in room 200 fall   
out of bed attempting to drink a glass of water. He hears the IV tubes   
bursting, the sweet plasma spinning between the walls, the bag slipping to   
the floor and splattering through the night's open screens. 

The man screams. Vomits blood and ulcers. Gets tangled up in sheets and   
transparent plastic veins. After half an hour doves fly in. The leaves fall.   
Fast. 

After a few days a black man enters room 199. An orderly. He cleans his   
body with a warm sponge. His hands run slowly down the yellowed back,   
the belly and fragile shoulders of Randi. Dark birds fly over a forgotten   
landscape. Randi looks at his mother rubbing his chest with alcohol to   
quiet the cough before he sleeps. He turns his face. Imagines his one-room   
house, a trailer his father made out of an old car. They're on a little ranch   
at the outskirts of an unknown town. The mountains reflect the afternoon's   
coppery heat. From afar you can see birds crossing above the saguaros and   
the sky. 

The last time I saw Randi was at San Francisco City College. He had just   
turned in all his papers so he could drop out at midterm. He didn't want to   
go on with it. It was a farce. 

Like when he was invited to read poetry near the Galera de La Raza in the   
Mission District. He never showed up. Took 18th instead of 24th Street.   
Some Latinos beat him up. They noticed a homosexual air about him. 

Lies do not exist, only the grafik. 
This figure has no scars / / / / / 

       When I had you they didn't give 
       me anything. I grabbed onto the 
       washbasin until I thought I'd die 
       they did that then. They strapped . . .

Eva (circa 1946), the doctor says they have to operate. Your pelvis is too   
narrow. The child can't be born. It will come out in pieces. Eva. They'll have   
to operate. 

He says he'll give you morphine for the stitches afterwards. Even if you   
scream, Eva, it'll be alright. Even if the nurses ignore you, laugh at you as   
they see your bluish mouth open, your sleepwalker's eyes, your hands   
scratching against the metal bed or the air or memories. For one long   
second they'll study your womb in bandages stains clouds raindrops suns   
and rouge shadows and rage over the coffin hidden by 10 centimeters of   
vertical stitching. Eva. You'll hemorrhage 29 days later while washing   
clothes over a tin basin. 

Eva. The doctor is smiling. Have faith in him. He says everything is fine.   
I've signed the papers. Everything is arranged, girl. 

   --The pencil wakes 
   --The sheet tightens, the rubber vibrates 
   --The magazine fades 
   --The watch is speechless 

Someone has erased all the E's from all the pages; small empty rectangles   
remain. The ink runs searching for asylum. 

   --Emerald green is the color of jagged grass 
   diluted in great bottles of tears, spit and 
   alcohol. It's rain for a hell of cells. They burn 
   and burn and burn. 

S / I / E / B / R / E / N / N / E / N 

Diego, you touch up a colossal worker with too-sad eyes, wearing a faded   
blue cotton shirt. His eyes are swollen. The worker wants to see, but his   
eyes don't count anymore, just his hands. 
They fly. 

They untangle above new machines toward the future. Touching the   
atmosphere. The fingers touch the 17th of February, 1981. 

The National Guard enters the province of Las Cabaas in El Salvador. They   
trap the area, cutting off all the roads out for the campesinos. Bombs fall.   
The mountains explode rocks, roots and water. An iron shell splinter rips   
into the throats of grandfathers and little girls. The initials U S A sweat. 

They sweat through the paint of the Guardia helicopters swooping down   
over the huts and fields of corn. 

Seven thousand begin to run toward the Ro Lempa. 15km and then the wide   
river. 15km and then maybe refuge in the jungles of Honduras. Only 
15kms 
 9kms 
 7kms 
 6kms    a pregnant young woman disappears 
 5kms    the Guardia captured her along with the others 
 4kms    they rip off her clothes 
 4kms    soldiers in masculine green stained uniforms circle her 
 4kms    they tie her arms and legs 
 3kms    the bayonet penetrates 

 2kms    it etches an x of red tears over the furious womb 
 6kms    the proud soldier throws down his weapon 
12kms   sinks his right hand 
 9kms    rips out the fetus with the fingernails of his hot fingers 
13kms   lifts it up like a torch 
 1km      opening his mouth the soldier screams 
15kms   One less communist in El Salvador! 

They reach the river. They jump in the water. Suddenly, from the Honduran   
side other helicopters and machine guns appear. The wind surrenders. The   
afternoon weakens. 

The giant worker's machinery shrieks on the tiny corner of the page: Plate   
number 113. It's your self-portrait that you painted on the wall of the   
San Francisco Art Institute. 

Few blades have been needed / / / / / 

This time. I used a few blades to fill the canvas with its dramatis   
personae, landscapes and scenes that have been held back and kept secret;   
a figure dealt out in different boxes toward different destinies. No one   
has been able to figure out what happened on this table. But it's time to   
turn off the black lamp. 

If the ask me, I'll do the only thing I can. I'll show them everything   
I have; the only thing that counts:

Sonnet 16
 

Long have I long'd to see my love againe,
    Still have I wisht, but never could obtaine it;
    Rather than all the world (if I might gaine it)
Would I desire my love's sweet precious gaine.
Yet in my soule I see him everie day,
    See him, and see his still sterne countenaunce,
    But (ah) what is of long continuance,
Where majestie and beautie beares the sway?
Sometimes, when I imagine that I see him,
    (As love is full of foolish fantasies)
    Weening to kisse his lips, as my love's fees,
I feele but aire: nothing but aire to bee him.
    Thus with Ixion, kisse I clouds in vaine:
    Thus with Ixion, feele I endles paine.







Sonnet 17
 

Cherry-lipt Adonis in his snowie shape, 
    Might not compare with his pure ivorie white, 
    On whose faire front a poet's pen may write, 
Whose roseate red excels the crimson grape, 
His love-enticing delicate soft limbs, 
    Are rarely fram'd t'intrap poore gazine eies: 
    His cheeks, the lillie and carnation dies, 
With lovely tincture which Apollo's dims. 
His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet, 
    His mouth a Hive, his tongue a hony-combe, 
    Where Muses (like bees) make their mansion. 
His teeth pure pearle in blushing correll set. 
    Oh how can such a body sinne-procuring, 
    Be slow to love, and quicke to hate, enduring? 







from The Womans Labor. An Epistle to Mr Stephen Duck
 

 [The Washerwoman]
    When bright Orion glitters in the skies
In winter nights, then early we must rise;
The weather ne'er so bad, wind, rain or snow,
Our work appointed, we must rise and go,
While you on easy beds may lie and sleep,
Till light does through your chamber-windows peep.
When to the house we come where we should go,
How to get in, alas! we do not know:
The maid quite tired with work the day before,
O'ercome with sleep; we standing at the door,
Oppressed with cold, and often call in vain,
Ere to our work we can admittance gain.
But when from wind and weather we get in,
Briskly with courage we our work begin;
Heaps of fine linen we before us view,
Whereon to lay our strength and patience too;
Cambrics and muslins, which our ladies wear,
Laces and edgings, costly, fine and rare,
Which must be washed with utmost skill and care;
With holland shirts, ruffles and fringes too,
Fashions which our forefathers never knew.
For several hours here we work and slave,
Before we can one glimpse of daylight have;
We labor hard before the morning's past,
Because we fear the time runs on too fast.

    At length bright Sol illuminates the skies,
And summons drowsy mortals to arise;
Then comes our mistress to us without fail,
And in her hand, perhaps, a mug of ale
To cheer our hearts, and also to inform
Herself what work is done that very morn;
Lays her commands upon us, that we mind
Her linen well, nor leave the dirt behind.
Not this alone, but also to take care
We don't her cambrics nor her ruffles tear;
And these most strictly does of us require,
To save her soap and sparing be of fire;
Tells us her charge is great, nay furthermore,
Her clothes are fewer than the time before.
Now we drive on, resolved our strength to try,
And what we can we do most willingly;
Until with heat and work, 'tis often known,
Not only sweat but blood runs trickling down
Our wrists and fingers: still our work demands
The constant action of our laboring hands.

    Now night comes on, from whence you have relief,
But that, alas! does not increase our grief.
With heavy hearts we often view the sun,
Fearing he'll set before our work is done;
For, either in the morning or at night,
We piece the summer's day with candlelight.
Though we all day with care our work attend,
Such is our fate, we know not when 'twill end.
When evening's come, you homeward take your way;
We, till our work is done, are forced to stay,
And, after all our toil and labor past,
Sixpence or eightpence pays us off at last;
For all our pains no prospect can we see
Attend us, but old age and poverty.







Barbershop Quartet, East Village Grille
 

Inside the standard lunch hour din they rise, four   
seamless voices fused into one, floating somewhere   
between a low hum and a vibration, like the sound   
of a train rumbling beneath noisy traffic.   
The men are hunched around a booth table,   
a fire circle of coffee cups and loose fists, leaning in   
around the thing they are summoning forth   
from inside this suddenly beating four-chambered   
heart.   I've taken Avery out on a whim, ordered quesadillas   
and onion rings, a kiddy milk with three straws.   
We're already deep in the meal, extra napkins   
and wipes for the grease coating our faces   
and hands like mid-summer sweat.   And because   
we're happy, lost in the small pleasures of father   
and son, at first their voices seem to come from inside   
us. Who's that boy singing? Avery asks, unable   
to see these men wrapped in their act.   I let him   
keep looking, rapt.   And when no one is paying   
attention, I put down my fork and take my boy's hand,   
and together we dive into the song.   Or maybe it pours   
into us, and we're the ones brimming with it.





Eclogue the Second: HASSAN; or, the Camel-driver.
 

scene, the desert.
time, mid-day.  
    In silent horror o'er the desert-waste
The driver  Hassan with his camels past.
One cruse of water on his back he bore,
And his light scrip contained a scanty store:
A fan of painted feathers in his hand,
To guard his shaded face from scorching sand.
The sultry sun had gained the middle sky,
And not a tree, and not an herb was nigh.
The beasts, with pain, their dusty way pursue,
Shrill roared the winds, and dreary was the view!
With desperate sorrow wild, th' affrighted man
Thrice sighted, thrice struck his breast, and thus began:
    Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,
    When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way.

    Ah! little thought I of the blasting wind,
The thirst or pinching hunger that I find!
Bethink thee,  Hassan, where shall thirst assuage,
When fails this cruise, his unrelenting rage?
Soon shall this scrip its precious load resign;
Then what but tears and hunger shall be thine?

    Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear
In all my griefs a more than equal share!
Here, where no springs in murmurs break away,
Or moss-corned fountains mitigate the day,
In vain ye hope the green delights to know,
Which plains more blessed, or verdant vales bestow.
Here rocks alone, and tasteless sands are found,
And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around.
    Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,
    When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!

    Cursed be the gold and silver which persuade
Weak men to follow far-fatiguing trade!
The Lily-Peace outshines the silver store,
And life is dearer than the golden ore.
Yet money tempts us o'er the desert brown,
To ev'ry distant mart and wealthy town:

Full oft we tempt the land, and oft the sea;
And are we only yet repaid by thee?
Ah! why was ruin so attractive made,
Or why fond Man so easily betrayed?
Why heed we not, whilst mad we haste along,
The gentle voice of Peace or Pleasure's song?
Or wherefore think the flow'ry mountain's side,
The fountain's murmurs, and the valley's pride,
Why think we these less pleasing to behold,
Than dreary deserts, if they lead to gold?
    Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,
    When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way.

    O cease, my fears! all frantic as I go,
When Thought creates unnumbered scenes of woe,
What if the lion in his rage I meet!
Oft in the dust I view his printed feet:
And fearful! oft, when Day's declining light
Yields her pale empire to the mourner Night,
By hunger roused, he scours the groaning plain,
Gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train:
Before them death with shrieks directs their way,
Fills the wild yell, and leads them to their prey.
    Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,
    When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!

    At that dead hour the silent asp shall creep,
If ought of rest I find, upon my sleep:
Or some swoln serpent twist his scales around,
And wake to anguish with a burning wound.
Thrice happy they, the wise contented poor,
From lust of wealth, and dread of death secure!
They tempt no deserts and no griefs they find;
Peace rules the day, where reason rules the mind.
    Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,
    When first from Schiraz' walls I bent my way!

    O hapless youth! for she thy love hath won,
The tender Zara, will be most undone!
Big swelled my hearte and owned the pow'rful maid,
When fast she dropped her tears, as thus she said:
Farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain,
Whom Zara's breaking heart implored in vain;
Yet as thou go'st, may ev'ry blast arise,
Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs!
Safe o'er the wild, no perils mayst thou see,
No griefs endure, nor weep, false youth, like me.
O let me safely to the fair return,
Say with a kiss, she must not, shall not mourn.
Go teach my heart to lose its painful fears,
Recalled by Wisdom's voice and Zara's tears.

    He said, and called on Heav'n to bless the day,
When back to Schiraz' walls he bent this way.







Fabrication of Ancestors
 

For old Billy Dugan, shot in the ass in the Civil War, my father said.
The old wound in my ass 
has opened up again, but I 
am past the prodigies
of youth's campaigns, and weep
where I used to laugh
in war's red humors, half
in love with silly-assed pains
and half not feeling them. 
I have to sit up with 
an indoor unsittable itch 
before I go down late
and weeping to the storm-
cellar on a dirty night
and go to bed with the worms.
So pull the dirt up over me 
and make a family joke 
for Old Billy Blue Balls,
the oldest private in the world
with two ass-holes and no
place more to go to for a laugh
except the last one. Say:
The North won the Civil War
without much help from me 
although I wear a proof 
of the war's obscenity.





We Are Seven
 

------A simple Child,
That lightly draws its breath,
And feels its life in every limb,
What should it know of death?

I met a little cottage Girl:
She was eight years old, she said;
Her hair was thick with many a curl
That clustered round her head.

She had a rustic, woodland air,
And she was wildly clad:
Her eyes were fair, and very fair;
--Her beauty made me glad.

Sisters and brothers, little Maid,
How many may you be?
How many? Seven in all, she said,
And wondering looked at me.

And where are they? I pray you tell.
She answered, Seven are we;
And two of us at Conway dwell,
And two are gone to sea.

Two of us in the church-yard lie,
My sister and my brother;
And, in the church-yard cottage, I
Dwell near them with my mother.

You say that two at Conway dwell,
And two are gone to sea,
Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell,
Sweet Maid, how this may be.

Then did the little Maid reply,
Seven boys and girls are we;
Two of us in the church-yard lie,
Beneath the church-yard tree.

You run about, my little Maid,
Your limbs they are alive;
If two are in the church-yard laid,
Then ye are only five.

Their graves are green, they may be seen,
The little Maid replied,
Twelve steps or more from my mother's door,
And they are side by side.

My stockings there I often knit,
My kerchief there I hem;
And there upon the ground I sit,
And sing a song to them.

And often after sun-set, Sir,
When it is light and fair,
I take my little porringer,
And eat my supper there.

The first that dies was sister Jane;
In bed she moaning lay,
Till God released her of her pain;
And then she went away.

So in the church-yard she was laid;
And, when the grass was dry,
Together round her grave we played,
My brother John and I.

And when the ground was white with snow,
And I could run and slide,
My brother John was forced to go,
And he lies by her side.

How many are you, then, said I,
If they two are in heaven?
Quick was the little Maid's reply,
O Master! we are seven.

But they are dead; those two are dead!
Their spirits are in heaven!
'Twas throwing words away; for still
The little Maid would have her will,
And said, Nay, we are seven!







Nuns Fret Not at Their Convents Narrow Room
 

Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room; 
And hermits are contented with their cells; 
And students with their pensive citadels; 
Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom, 
Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom, 
High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells, 
Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells: 
In truth the prison, into which we doom 
Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me, 
In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound 
Within the Sonnet's scanty plot of ground; 
Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be) 
Who have felt the weight of too much liberty, 
Should find brief solace there, as I have found.





Lochinvar
 

O young Lochinvar is come out of the west, 
Through all the wide Border his steed was the best; 
And save his good broadsword he weapons had none, 
He rode all unarm'd, and he rode all alone. 
So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war, 
There never was knight like the young Lochinvar. 

He staid not for brake, and he stopp'd not for stone, 
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none; 
But ere he alighted at Netherby gate, 
The bride had consented, the gallant came late: 
For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war, 
Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar. 

So boldly he enter'd the Netherby Hall, 
Among bride's-men, and kinsmen, and brothers and all: 
Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword, 
(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,) 
"O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war, 
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar? 

"I long woo'd your daughter, my suit you denied;-- 
Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide-- 
And now I am come, with this lost love of mine, 
To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine. 
There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far, 
That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar. 

The bride kiss'd the goblet: the knight took it up, 
He quaff'd off the wine, and he threw down the cup. 
She look'd down to blush, and she look'd up to sigh, 
With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye. 
He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,-- 
"Now tread we a measure! said young Lochinvar. 

So stately his form, and so lovely her face, 
That never a hall such a galliard did grace; 
While her mother did fret, and her father did fume, 
And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume; 
And the bride-maidens whisper'd, "'twere better by far 
To have match'd our fair cousin with young Lochinvar. 

One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear, 
When they reach'd the hall-door, and the charger stood near; 
So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung, 
So light to the saddle before her he sprung! 
"She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur; 
They'll have fleet steeds that follow, quoth young Lochinvar. 

There was mounting 'mong Graemes of the Netherby clan; 
Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran: 
There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee, 
But the lost bride of Netherby ne'er did they see. 
So daring in love, and so dauntless in war, 
Have ye e'er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar? 








The Eolian Harp
 

composed at clevedon, somersetshire
My pensive Sara! thy soft cheek reclined 
Thus on mine arm, most soothing sweet it is 
To sit beside our Cot, our Cot o'ergrown 
With white-flowered Jasmin, and the broad-leaved Myrtle, 
(Meet emblems they of Innocence and Love!) 
And watch the clouds, that late were rich with light, 
Slow saddening round, and mark the star of eve 
Serenely brilliant (such would Wisdom be) 
Shine opposite! How exquisite the scents 
Snatched from yon bean-field! and the world so hushed! 
The stilly murmur of the distant Sea 
Tells us of silence. 

                            And that simplest Lute, 
Placed length-ways in the clasping casement, hark! 
How by the desultory breeze caressed, 
Like some coy maid half yielding to her lover, 
It pours such sweet upbraiding, as must needs 
Tempt to repeat the wrong! And now, its strings 
Boldlier swept, the long sequacious notes 
Over delicious surges sink and rise, 
Such a soft floating witchery of sound 
As twilight Elfins make, when they at eve 
Voyage on gentle gales from Fairy-Land, 
Where Melodies round honey-dropping flowers, 
Footless and wild, like birds of Paradise, 
Nor pause, nor perch, hovering on untamed wing! 
O! the one Life within us and abroad, 
Which meets all motion and becomes its soul, 
A light in sound, a sound-like power in light, 
Rhythm in all thought, and joyance everywhere-- 
Methinks, it should have been impossible 
Not to love all things in a world so filled; 
Where the breeze warbles, and the mute still air 
Is Music slumbering on her instrument. 

    And thus, my Love! as on the midway slope 
Of yonder hill I stretch my limbs at noon, 
Whilst through my half-closed eyelids I behold 
The sunbeams dance, like diamonds, on the main, 
And tranquil muse upon tranquility: 
Full many a thought uncalled and undetained, 
And many idle flitting phantasies, 
Traverse my indolent and passive brain, 
As wild and various as the random gales 
That swell and flutter on this subject Lute! 

    And what if all of animated nature 
Be but organic Harps diversely framed, 
That tremble into thought, as o'er them sweeps 
Plastic and vast, one intellectual breeze, 
At once the Soul of each, and God of all? 

    But thy more serious eye a mild reproof 
Darts, O beloved Woman! nor such thoughts 
Dim and unhallowed dost thou not reject, 
And biddest me walk humbly with my God. 
Meek Daughter in the family of Christ! 
Well hast thou said and holily dispraised 
These shapings of the unregenerate mind; 
Bubbles that glitter as they rise and break 
On vain Philosophy's aye-babbling spring. 
For never guiltless may I speak of him, 
The Incomprehensible! save when with awe 
I praise him, and with Faith that inly feels; 
Who with his saving mercies heald me, 
A sinful and most miserable man, 
Wildered and dark, and gave me to possess 
Peace, and this Cot, and thee, heart-honored Maid! 







Epitaph
 

Stop, Christian passer-by!--Stop, child of God,
And read with gentle breast. Beneath this sod
A poet lies, or that which once seemed he.
O, lift one thought in prayer for S. T. C.;
That he who many a year with toil of breath
Found death in life, may here find life in death!
Mercy for praise--to be forgiven for fame
He asked, and hoped, through Christ. Do thou the same!







To Wordsworth
 

Poet of Nature, thou hast wept to know

That things depart which never may return:

Childhood and youth, friendship and love's first glow,

Have fled like sweet dreams, leaving thee to mourn.

These common woes I feel. One loss is mine

Which thou too feel'st, yet I alone deplore.

Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shine

On some frail bark in winter's midnight roar:

Thou hast like to a rock-built refuge stood

Above the blind and battling multitude:

In honoured poverty thy voice did weave

Songs consecrate to truth and liberty,--

Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve,

Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to be.








A Song: Men of England
 

Men of England, wherefore plough

For the lords who lay ye low?

Wherefore weave with toil and care

The rich robes your tyrants wear?


Wherefore feed and clothe and save

From the cradle to the grave

Those ungrateful drones who would

Drain your sweat--nay, drink your blood?


Wherefore, Bees of England, forge

Many a weapon, chain, and scourge,

That these stingless drones may spoil

The forced produce of your toil?


Have ye leisure, comfort, calm,

Shelter, food, love's gentle balm?

Or what is it ye buy so dear

With your pain and with your fear?


The seed ye sow, another reaps;

The wealth ye find, another keeps;

The robes ye weave, another wears;

The arms ye forge, another bears.


Sow seed--but let no tyrant reap:

Find wealth--let no imposter heap:

Weave robes--let not the idle wear:

Forge arms--in your defence to bear.


Shrink to your cellars, holes, and cells--

In hall ye deck another dwells.

Why shake the chains ye wrought? Ye see

The steel ye tempered glance on ye.


With plough and spade and hoe and loom

Trace your grave and build your tomb

And weave your winding-sheet--till fair

England be your Sepulchre.








On Seeing the Elgin Marbles
 

My spirit is too weak--mortality 
   Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep, 
   And each imagined pinnacle and steep 
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die 
Like a sick eagle looking at the sky. 
   Yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep 
   That I have not the cloudy winds to keep 
Fresh for the opening of the morning's eye. 
Such dim-conceived glories of the brain 
   Bring round the heart an undescribable feud; 
So do these wonders a most dizzy pain, 
   That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude 
Wasting of old time--with a billowy main-- 
   A sun--a shadow of a magnitude. 







On Liberty and Slavery
 

Alas! and am I born for this,
   To wear this slavish chain?
Deprived of all created bliss,
   Through hardship, toil and pain!

How long have I in bondage lain,
   And languished to be free!
Alas! and must I still complain--
   Deprived of liberty.

Oh, Heaven! and is there no relief
   This side the silent grave--
To soothe the pain--to quell the grief
   And anguish of a slave?

Come Liberty, thou cheerful sound,
   Roll through my ravished ears!
Come, let my grief in joys be drowned,
   And drive away my fears.

Say unto foul oppression, Cease:
   Ye tyrants rage no more,
And let the joyful trump of peace,
   Now bid the vassal soar.

Soar on the pinions of that dove
   Which long has cooed for thee,
And breathed her notes from Afric's grove,
   The sound of Liberty.

Oh, Liberty! thou golden prize,
   So often sought by blood--
We crave thy sacred sun to rise,
   The gift of nature's God!

Bid Slavery hide her haggard face,
   And barbarism fly:
I scorn to see the sad disgrace
   In which enslaved I lie.

Dear Liberty! upon thy breast,
   I languish to respire; 
And like the Swan unto her nest,
   I'd like to thy smiles retire.

Oh, blest asylum--heavenly balm!
   Unto thy boughs I flee--
And in thy shades the storm shall calm,
   With songs of Liberty!







Light
 

Another drought morning after a too brief dawn downpour, 
unaccountable silvery glitterings on the leaves of the withering maples-- 

I think of a troop of the blissful blessed approaching Dante, 
"a hundred spheres shining, he rhapsodizes, "the purest pearls 

then of the frightening brilliants myriad gleam in my lamp 
of the eyes of the vast swarm of bats I found once in a cave, 

a chamber whose walls seethed with a spaceless carpet of creatures, 
their cacophonous, keen, insistent, incessant squeakings and squealings 

churning the warm, rank, cloying air; of how one, 
perfectly still among all the fitfully twitching others, 

was looking straight at me, gazing solemnly, thoughtfully up 
from beneath the intricate furl of its leathery wings 

as though it couldn't believe I was there, or were trying to place me, 
to situate me in the gnarl we'd evolved from, and now, 

the trees still heartrendingly asparkle, Dante again, 
this time the way he'll refer to a figure he meets as "the life of 

not the soul, or person, the life, and once more the bat, and I, 
our lives in that moment together, our lives, our lives, 

his with no vision of celestial splendor, no poem, 
mine with no flight, no unblundering dash through the dark, 

his without realizing it would, so soon, no longer exist, 
mine having to know for us both that everything ends, 

world, after-world, even their memory, steamed away 
like the film of uncertain vapor of the last of the luscious rain.





I Am the Only Being Whose Doom
 

I am the only being whose doom
No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn;
I never caused a thought of gloom,
A smile of joy, since I was born.

In secret pleasure, secret tears,
This changeful life has slipped away,
As friendless after eighteen years,
As lone as on my natal day.

There have been times I cannot hide,
There have been times when this was drear,
When my sad soul forgot its pride
And longed for one to love me here.

But those were in the early glow
Of feelings since subdued by care;
And they have died so long ago,
I hardly now believe they were.

First melted off the hope of youth,
Then fancy's rainbow fast withdrew;
And then experience told me truth
In mortal bosoms never grew.

'Twas grief enough to think mankind
All hollow, servile, insincere;
But worse to trust to my own mind
And find the same corruption there







The West Country
 

Have you been in our wild west country? then
   You have often had to pass
Its cabins lying like birds' nests in
   The wild green prairie grass.

Have you seen the women forget their wheels
   As they sat at the door to spin--
Have you seen the darning fall away
   From their fingers worn and thin,

As they asked you news of the villages
   Where they were used to be,
Gay girls at work in the factories
   With their lovers gone to sea!

Ah, have you thought of the bravery
   That no loud praise provokes--
Of the tragedies acted in the lives
   Of poor, hard-working folks!

Of the little more, and the little more
   Of hardship which they press
Upon their own tired hands to make
   The toil for the children less:

And not in vain; for many a lad
   Born to rough work and ways,
Strips off his ragged coat, and makes
   Men clothe him with their praise.







Growing Old
 

What is it to grow old? 
Is it to lose the glory of the form, 
The luster of the eye? 
Is it for beauty to forego her wreath? 
--Yes, but not this alone. 

Is it to feel our strength-- 
Not our bloom only, but our strength--decay? 
Is it to feel each limb 
Grow stiffer, every function less exact, 
Each nerve more loosely strung? 

Yes, this, and more; but not 
Ah, 'tis not what in youth we dreamed 'twould be! 
'Tis not to have our life 
Mellowed and softened as with sunset glow, 
A golden day's decline. 

'Tis not to see the world 
As from a height, with rapt prophetic eyes, 
And heart profoundly stirred; 
And weep, and feel the fullness of the past, 
The years that are no more. 

It is to spend long days 
And not once feel that we were ever young; 
It is to add, immured 
In the hot prison of the present, month 
To month with weary pain. 

It is to suffer this, 
And feel but half, and feebly, what we feel. 
Deep in our hidden heart 
Festers the dull remembrance of a change, 
But no emotion--none. 

It is--last stage of all-- 
When we are frozen up within, and quite 
The phantom of ourselves, 
To hear the world applaud the hollow ghost 
Which blamed the living man. 







The Self-Unseeing
 

Here is the ancient floor,

Footworn and hollowed and thin,

Here was the former door

Where the dead feet walked in.


She sat here in her chair,

Smiling into the fire;

He who played stood there,

Bowing it higher and higher.


Childlike, I danced in a dream;

Blessings emblazoned that day;

Everything glowed with a gleam;

Yet we were looking away!








During Wind and Rain
 

They sing their dearest songs-- 
       He, she, all of them--yea, 
       Treble and tenor and bass, 
            And one to play; 
      With the candles mooning each face. . . . 
            Ah, no; the years O! 
How the sick leaves reel down in throngs! 

       They clear the creeping moss-- 
       Elders and juniors--aye, 
       Making the pathways neat 
            And the garden gay; 
       And they build a shady seat. . . . 
            Ah, no; the years, the years, 
See, the white storm-birds wing across. 

       They are blithely breakfasting all-- 
       Men and maidens--yea, 
       Under the summer tree, 
            With a glimpse of the bay, 
       While pet fowl come to the knee. . . . 
            Ah, no; the years O! 
And the rotten rose is ript from the wall. 

       They change to a high new house, 
       He, she, all of them--aye, 
       Clocks and carpets and chairs 
          On the lawn all day, 
       And brightest things that are theirs. . . . 
          Ah, no; the years, the years 
Down their carved names the rain-drop ploughs. 







Rain
 

Rain, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain 
On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me 
Remembering again that I shall die 
And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks 
For washing me cleaner than I have been 
Since I was born into solitude. 
Blessed are the dead that the rain rains upon: 
But here I pray that none whom once I loved 
Is dying tonight or lying still awake 
Solitary, listening to the rain, 
Either in pain or thus in sympathy 
Helpless among the living and the dead, 
Like a cold water among broken reeds, 
Myriads of broken reeds all still and stiff, 
Like me who have no love which this wild rain 
Has not dissolved except the love of death, 
If love it be towards what is perfect and 
Cannot, the tempest tells me, disappoint.

Constantly Risking Absurdity (#15)
 

Constantly risking absurdity 
                                             and death 
            whenever he performs 
                                        above the heads 
                                                            of his audience

                                 climbs on rime 
                                          to a high wire of his own making 
and balancing on eyebeams 
                                     above a sea of faces 
             paces his way 
                               to the other side of day 
    performing entrechats 
                               and sleight-of-foot tricks 
 and other high theatrics 
                               and all without mistaking 
                     any thing 
                               for what it may not be 

       For he's the super realist 
                                     who must perforce perceive

from The Changeling
 

Deflores. What makes your lip so strange? This must not be betwixt us. 
Beatrice. The man talks wildly. 
Deflores. Come kisse me with a zeal now. 
Beatrice. Heaven I doubt him. 
Deflores. I will not stand so long to beg 'em shortly. 
Beatrice. Take heed Deflores of forgetfulness, 'twill soon betray us. 
Deflores. Take you heed first; 
Faith y'are grown much forgetfull, y'are to blame in't. 
Beatrice. He's bold, and I am blam'd for't. 
Deflores. I have eas'd you of your trouble, think on't, I'me in pain, 
And must be as'd of ou; 'tis a charity, 
Justice invites your blood to understand me. 
Beatrice. I dare not. 
Deflores. Quickly. 
Beatrice. Oh I never shall, speak if yet further of that I may lose 
What has been spoken, and no sound remain on't. 
 would not hear so much offence again for such another deed. 
Deflores. Soft, Lady, soft; the last is not yet paid for, oh this act 
Has put me into spirit; I was as greedy on't 
As the parcht earth of moisture when the clouds weep. 
Did you ot mark, I wrought my self into't. 
Nay sued, and kneel'd for't: Why was all that pains took? 
You see I have thrown contempt upon your gold, 
Not that I want it, for I doe piteously, 
In order I will come unto't, and make use on't, 
But 'twas not held so pretious to begin with; 
For I place wealth after the heels of pleasure, 
And where I not resolv'd in my belief 
That thy virginity were perfect in thee, 
I should but take my recompense with grudging, 
As if I had but halfe my hopes I agreed for. 
Beatrice. Why 'tis impossible thou canst be so wicked, 
Or shelter such a cunning cruelty, 
To make his death the murderer of my honor. 
Thy language is so bold and vitious, 
I cannot see which way I can forgive it with any modesty. 
Deflores. Push, you forget your selfe, a woman dipt in blood, and talk of modesty. 
Beatrice. O misery of sin! would I had been bound Perpetually unto my living hate 
In that Piracquo, then to hear these words. 
Think but upon the distance that Creation 
Set 'twixt thy blood and mine, and keep thee there. 
Deflores. Look but into your conscience, read me there, 
'Tis a true Book, you'l find me there your equall: 
Push, flye not to your birth, but settle you 
In what the act has made you, y'are no more now, 
You must forget your parentage to me, 
Y'are the deeds creature, by that name 
You lost your first condition, and I challenge you, 
As peace and innocency has turn'd you out, 
And made you one with me. 
Beatrice. With thee, foul villain? 
Deflores. Yes, my fair murdress; Do you urge me? 
Though thou wri'st maid, thou whore in thy affection, 
'Twas chang'd from thy first love, and that's a kind 
Of whoredome in thy heart, and he's chang'd now, 
To bring thy second on the Alsemero, 
Whom 'by all sweets that ever darkness tasted, 
If I enjoy thee not thou ne're enjoyst, 
I'le blast the hopes and joyes of marriage, 
I'le confess all, my life I rate at nothing. 
Beatrice. Deflores. 
Deflores. I shall rest from all lovers plagues then, 
I live in pain now: that shooting eye 
Will burn my heart to cinders. 
Beatrice. O sir, hear me. 
Deflores. She that in life and love refuses me, 
In death and shame my partner she shall be. 
Beatrice. Stay, hear me once for all, I make thee master 
Of all the wealth I have in gold and jewels, 
Let me go poor unto my bed with honor, 
And i am rich in all things. 
Deflores. Let this silence thee, 
The wealth of all Valentia shall not buy my pleasure from me, 
Can you weep Fate from its determin'd purpose? 
So soon may weep me. 
Beatrice. Vengeance begins; 
Murder I see is followed by more sins. 
Was my creation in the womb so curst, 
It must ingender with a Viper first? 
Deflores. Come, rise, and shrowd your blushes in my bosome, 
Silence is one of pleasures best receipts: 
Thy peace is wrought for ever in this yeelding. 
'Lasse how the Turtle pants! Thou'lt love anon, 
What thou so fear'st, and faintst to venture on.         
                                                                     Exeunt. 
                                                                     (Act III, scene iv) 

Enter Deflores bringing in Beatrice 
Deflores. Here we are, if you have any more   
To say to us, speak quickly, I shall not, 
Give you the hearing else, I am so stout yet, 
and so I think that broken rib of mankind. 
Vermandero. An Host of enemies entred my Citadell, 
Could not amaze like this, Joanna, Beatrice, Joanna. 
Beatrice. O come not neer me sir, I shall defile you, 
I am that of your blood was taken from you 
For your better health, look no more upon't, 
But cast it to the ground regardlessly, 
Let the common shewer take it from distinction, 
Beneath the starres, upon yon Meteor 
Ever hang my fate, 'mongst things corruptible, 
I ne're could pluck ti from him, my loathing 
Was Prophet to the rest, but ne're believ'd 
Mine honour fell with him, and now my life. 
Alsemero, I am a stranger to your bed, 
Your bed was coz'ned on the nuptiall night, 
For which your false-bride died. 
Alfermero. Diaphanta? 
Deflores. Yes, and the while I coupled with your mate   
At barly-break; now we are left in hell. 
Vermandero. We are all there, it circumscribes here. 
Deflores. I lov'd this woman in spite of her heart, 
Her love I earn'd out of Piracquos murder. 
Tomaso. Ha, my brothers murtherer. 
Deflores. Yes, and her honors prize 
Was my reward, I thank life for nothing 
But that pleasure, it was so sweet to me, 
That I have drunk up all, left none behinde, 
For any man to pledge me. 
                                                                      (Act V, scene iii) 
                           







On the Subject of Doctors
 

I like to see doctors cough.
What kind of human being 
would grab all your money 
just when you're down? 
I'm not saying they enjoy this: 
"Sorry, Mr. Rodriguez, that's it, 
no hope! You might as well 
hand over your wallet." Hell no, 
they'd rather be playing golf 
and swapping jokes about our feet. 

Some of them smoke marijuana 
and are alcoholics, and their moral 
turpitude is famous: who gets to see 
most sex organs in the world? Not 
poets. With the hours they keep 
they need drugs more than anyone. 
Germ city, there's no hope 
looking down those fire-engine throats. 
They're bound to get sick themselves 
sometime; and I happen to be there 
myself in a high fever 
taking my plastic medicine seriously 
with the doctors, who are dying.

Fall, leaves, fall
 

Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night's decay
Ushers in a drearier day.





The Two Children
 

Heavy hangs the raindrop
From the burdened spray;
Heavy broods the damp mist
On uplands far away;

Heavy looms the dull sky,
Heavy rolls the sea--
And heavy beats the young heart
Beneath that lonely tree.

Never has a blue streak
Cleft the clouds since morn--
Never has his grim Fate
Smiled since he was born.

Frowning on the infant,
Shadowing childhood's joy,
Guardian angel knows not
That melancholy boy.

Day is passing swiftly
Its sad and sombre prime;
Youth is fast invading
Sterner manhood's time.

All the flowers are praying
For sun before they close,
And he prays too, unknowing,
That sunless human rose!

Blossoms, that the west wind
Has never wooed to blow,
Scentless are your petals,
Your dew as cold as snow.

Soul, where kindred kindness
No early promise woke,
Barren is your beauty
As weed upon the rock.

Wither, Brothers, wither,
You were vainly given--
Earth reserves no blessing
For the unblessed of Heaven!

Child of Delight! with sunbright hair,
And seablue, seadeep eyes;
Spirit of Bliss, what brings thee here,
Beneath these sullen skies?

Thou shouldst live in eternal spring,
Where endless day is never dim;
Why, seraph, has thy erring wing
Borne thee down to weep with him?

Ah, not from heaven am I descended,
And I do not come to mingle tears;
But sweet is day, though with shadows blended;
And, though clouded, sweet are youthful years.

I, the image of light and gladness,
Saw and pitied that mournful boy,
And I swore to take his gloomy sadness,
And give to him my beamy joy.

Heavy and dark the night is closing;
Heavy and dark may its biding be:
Better for all from grief reposing,
And better for all who watch like me.

Guardian angel, he lacks no longer;
Evil fortune he need not fear:
Fate is strong, but Love is stronger;
And more unsleeping than angel's care.







Jenny
 

 Vengeance of Jenny's case! Fie on her! Never name her, child!--Mrs. Quickly
Lazy laughing languid Jenny,
Fond of a kiss and fond of a guinea,
Whose head upon my knee to-night
Rests for a while, as if grown light
With all our dances and the sound
To which the wild tunes spun you round:
Fair Jenny mine, the thoughtless queen
Of kisses which the blush between
Could hardly make much daintier;
Whose eyes are as blue skies, whose hair
Is countless gold incomparable:
Fresh flower, scarce touched with signs that tell
Of Love's exuberant hotbed:--Nay,
Poor flower left torn since yesterday
Until to-morrow leave you bare;
Poor handful of bright spring-water
Flung in the whirlpool's shrieking face;
Poor shameful Jenny, full of grace
Thus with your head upon my knee;--
Whose person or whose purse may be
The lodestar of your reverie?

   This room of yours, my Jenny, looks
A change from mine so full of books,
Whose serried ranks hold fast, forsooth,
So many captive hours of youth,-- 
The hours they thieve from day and night
To make one's cherished work come right,
And leave it wrong for all their theft,
Even as to-night my work has left:
Until I vowed that since my brain
And eyes of dancing seemed so fain,
My feet should have some dancing too:--
And thus it was I met with you.
Well, I suppose 'twas hard to part,
For here I am. And now, sweetheart,
You seem too tired to get to bed.

   It was a careless life I led
When rooms like this were scarce so strange
Not long ago. What breeds the change,--
The many aims or the few years?
Because to-night it all appears
Something I do not know again.

   The   cloud's not danced out of my brain,--
The cloud that made it turn and swim
While hour by hour the books grew dim.
Why, Jenny, as I watch you there,--
For all your wealth of loosened hair,
Your silk ungirdled and unlac'd
And warm sweets open to the waist,
All golden in the lamplight's gleam,--
You know not what a book you seem,
Half-read by lightning in a dream!
How should you know, my Jenny? Nay,
And I should be ashamed to say:--
Poor beauty, so well worth a kiss!
But while my thought runs on like this
With wasteful whims more than enough,
I wonder what you're thinking of.

   If of myself you think at all,
What is the thought?--conjectural
On sorry matters best unsolved?--
Or inly is each grace revolved
To fit me with a lure?--or (sad
To think!) perhaps you're merely glad
That I'm not drunk or ruffianly
And let you rest upon my knee.

   For sometimes, were the truth confess'd,
You're thankful for a little rest,--
Glad from the crush to rest within,
From the heart-sickness and the din
Where envy's voice at virtue's pitch
Mocks you because your gown is rich;
And from the pale girl's dumb rebuke,
Whose ill-clad grace and toil-worn look
Proclaim the strength that keeps her weak,
And other nights than yours bespeak;
And from the wise unchildish elf,
To schoolmate lesser than himself
Pointing you out, what thing you are:--
Yes, from the daily jeer and jar,
From shame and shame's outbraving too,
Is rest not sometimes sweet to you?--
But most from the hatefulness of man
Who spares not to end what he began,
Whose acts are ill and his speech ill,
Who, having used you at his will,
Thrusts you aside, as when I dine
I serve the dishes and the wine. 

   Well, handsome Jenny mine, sit up:
I've filled our glasses, let us sup,
And do not let me think of you,
Lest shame of yours suffice for two.
What, still so tired? Well, well then, keep
Your head there, so you do not sleep;
But that the weariness may pass
And leave you merry, take this glass.
Ah! lazy lily hand, more bless'd
If ne'er in rings it had been dress'd
Nor ever by a glove conceal'd!

   Behold the lilies of the field,
They toil not neither do they spin;
(So doth the ancient text begin,--
Not of such rest as one of these
Can share.) Another rest and ease.
Along each summer-sated path
From its new lord the garden hath,
Than that whose spring in blessings ran
Which praised the bounteous husbandman,
Ere yet, in days of hankering breath,
The lilies sickened unto death.

   What, Jenny, are your lilies dead?
Aye, and the snow-white leaves are spread
Like winter on the garden-bed.
But you had roses left in May,--
They were not gone too. Jenny, nay,
But must your roses die, and those
Their purfled buds that should unclose?
Even so; the leaves are curled apart,
Still red as from the broken heart,
And here's the naked stem of thorns.

   Nay, nay mere words. Here nothing warns
As yet of winter. Sickness here
Or want alone could waken fear,--
Nothing but passion wrings a tear.
Except when there may rise unsought
Haply at times a passing thought
Of the old days which seem to be 
Much older than any history
That is written in any book;
When she would lie in fields and look
Along the ground through the blown grass,
And wonder where the city was,
Far out of sight, whose broil and bale
They told her then for a child's tale.

   Jenny, you know the city now,
A child can tell the tale there, how
Some things which are not yet enroll'd
In market-lists are bought and sold
Even till the early Sunday light,
When Saturday night is market-night
Everywhere, be it dry or wet,
And market-night in the Haymarket.
Our learned London children know,
Poor Jenny, all your pride and woe;
Have seen your lifted silken skirt
Advertise dainties through the dirt;
Have seen your coach-wheels splash rebuke
On virtue; and have learned your look
When, wealth and health slipped past, you stare
Along the streets alone, and there,
Round the long park, across the bridge,
The cold lamps at the pavement's edge
Wind on together and apart,
A fiery serpent for your heart.

   Let the thoughts pass, an empty cloud!
Suppose I were to think aloud,--
What if to her all this were said?
Why, as a volume seldom read
Being opened halfway shuts again,
So might the pages of her brain
Be parted at such words, and thence
Close back upon the dusty sense.
For is there hue or shape defin'd
In Jenny's desecrated mind,
Where all contagious currents meet,
A Lethe of the middle street?
Nay, it reflects not any face,
Nor sound is in its sluggish pace,
But as they coil those eddies clot,
And night and day remembers not.

   Why, Jenny, you're asleep at last!--
Asleep, poor Jenny, hard and fast,--
So young and soft and tired; so fair,
With chin thus nestled in your hair,
Mouth quiet, eyelids almost blue
As if some sky of dreams shone through!

   Just as another woman sleeps!
Enough to throw one's thoughts in heaps
Of doubt and horror,--what to say
Or think,--this awful secret sway,
The potter's power over the clay!
Of the same lump (it has been said)
For honour and dishonour made,
Two sister vessels. Here is one.

   My cousin Nell is fond of fun,
And fond of dress, and change, and praise,
So mere a woman in her ways:
And if her sweet eyes rich in youth
Are like her lips that tell the truth,
My cousin Nell is fond of love.
And she's the girl I'm proudest of.
Who does not prize her, guard her well?
The love of change, in cousin Nell,
Shall find the best and hold it dear:
The unconquered mirth turn quieter
Not through her own, through others' woe:
The conscious pride of beauty glow
Beside another's pride in her,
One little part of all they share.
For Love himself shall ripen these
In a kind of soil to just increase
Through years of fertilizing peace.

   Of the same lump (as it is said)
For honour and dishonour made,
Two sister vessels. Here is one.

   It makes a goblin of the sun.

   So pure,--so fall'n! How dare to think
Of the first common kindred link?
Yet, Jenny, till the world shall burn
It seems that all things take their turn;
And who shall say but this fair tree
May need, in changes that may be,
Your children's children's charity?
Scorned then, no doubt, as you are scorn'd!
Shall no man hold his pride forewarn'd
Till in the end, the Day of Days,
At Judgement, one of his own race,
As frail and lost as you, shall rise,--
His daughter, with his mother's eyes?

   How Jenny's clock ticks on the shelf!
Might not the dial scorn itself
That has such hours to register?
Yet as to me, even so to her
Are golden sun and silver moon,
In daily largesse of earth's boon,
Counted for life-coins to one tune.
And if, as blindfold fates are toss'd,
Through some one man this life be lost,
Shall soul not somehow pray for soul?

   Fair shines the gilded aureole
In which our highest painters place
Some living woman's simple face.
And the stilled features thus descried
As Jenny's long throat droops aside,--
The shadows where the cheeks are thin,
And pure wide curve from ear to chin,--
Whit Raffael's, Leonardo's hand
To show them to men's souls, might stand,
Whole ages long, the whole world through,
For preachings of what God can do.
What has man done here? How atone,
Great God, for this which man has done?
And for the body and soul which by
Man's pitiless doom must now comply
With lifelong hell, what lullaby
Of sweet forgetful second birth
Remains? All dark. No sign on earth
What measure of God's rest endows
The many mansions of his house.

   If but a woman's heart might see
Such erring heart unerringly
For once! But that can never be.

   Like a rose shut in a book 
In which pure women may not look, 
For its base pages claim control 
To crush the flower within the soul; 
Where through each dead rose-leaf that clings, 
Pale as transparent psyche-wings, 
To the vile text, are traced such things 
As might make lady's cheek indeed 
More than a living rose to read; 
So nought save foolish foulness may 
Watch with hard eyes the sure decay; 
And so the life-blood of this rose, 
Puddled with shameful knowledge, flows 
Through leaves no chaste hand may unclose: 
Yet still it keeps such faded show 
Of when 'twas gathered long ago, 
That the crushed petals' lovely grain, 
The sweetness of the sanguine stain, 
Seen of a woman's eyes, must make 
Her pitiful heart, so prone to ache, 
Love roses better for its sake:--
Only that this can never be:-- 
Even so unto her sex is she. 

   Yet, Jenny, looking long at you, 
The woman almost fades from view. 
A cipher of man's changeless sum 
Of lust, past, present, and to come, 
Is left. A riddle that one shrinks 
To challenge from the scornful sphinx. 

   Like a toad within a stone 
Seated while Time crumbles on; 
Which sits there since the earth was curs'd 
For Man's transgression at the first; 
Which, living through all centuries, 
Not once has seen the sun arise; 
Whose life, to its cold circle charmed, 
The earth's whole summers have not warmed; 
Which always--whitherso the stone 
Be flung--sits there, deaf, blind, alone;--
Aye, and shall not be driven out 
Till that which shuts him round about 
Break at the very Master's stroke, 
And the dust thereof vanish as smoke, 
And the seed of Man vanish as dust:--
Even so within this world is Lust. 

   Come, come, what use in thoughts like this? 
Poor little Jenny, good to kiss,-- 
You'd not believe by what strange roads
Thought travels, when your beauty goads 
A man to-night to think of toads! 
Jenny, wake up. . . . Why, there's the dawn! 

   And there's an early waggon drawn 
To market, and some sheep that jog 
Bleating before a barking dog; 
And the old streets come peering through 
Another night that London knew; 
And all as ghostlike as the lamps. 

   So on the wings of day decamps
My last night's frolic. Glooms begin 
To shiver off as lights creep in 
Past the gauze curtains half drawn-to, 
And the lamp's doubled shade grows blue,--
Your lamp, my Jenny, kept alight, 
Like a wise virgin's, all one night! 
And in the alcove coolly spread 
Glimmers with dawn your empty bed; 
And yonder your fair face I see 
Reflected lying on my knee, 
Where teems with first foreshadowings 
Your pier-glass scrawled with diamond rings: 
And on your bosom all night worn
Yesterday's rose now droops forlorn,
But dies not yet this summer morn.

   And now without, as if some word 
Had called upon them that they heard, 
The London sparrows far and nigh 
Clamour together suddenly; 
And Jenny's cage-bird grown awake 
Here in their song his part must take, 
Because here too the day doth break.

   And somehow in myself the dawn 
Among stirred clouds and veils withdrawn 
Strikes greyly on her. Let her sleep. 
But will it wake her if I heap 
These cushions thus beneath her head 
Where my knee was? No,--there's your bed, 
My Jenny, while you dream. And there 
I lay among your golden hair 
Perhaps the subject of your dreams, 
These golden coins. 
                              For still one deems 
That Jenny's flattering sleep confers 
New magic on the magic purse,-- 
Grim web, how clogged with shrivelled flies! 
Between the threads fine fumes arise 
And shape their pictures in the brain. 
There roll no streets in glare and rain, 
Nor flagrant man-swine whets his tusk; 
But delicately sighs in musk 
The homage of the dim boudoir; 
Or like a palpitating star 
Thrilled into song, the opera-night 
Breathes faint in the quick pulse of light; 
Or at the carriage-window shine 
Rich wares for choice; or, free to dine, 
Whirls through its hour of health (divine 
For her) the concourse of the Park. 
And though in the discounted dark 
Her functions there and here are one, 
Beneath the lamps and in the sun 
There reigns at least the acknowledged belle 
Apparelled beyond parallel. 
Ah Jenny, yes, we know your dreams. 

   For even the Paphian Venus seems, 
A goddess o'er the realms of love, 
When silver-shrined in shadowy grove: 
Aye, or let offerings nicely placed 
But hide Priapus to the waist, 
And whoso looks on him shall see 
An eligible deity. 

   Why, Jenny, waking here alone 
May help you to remember one, 
Though all the memory's long outworn 
Of many a double-pillowed morn. 
I think I see you when you wake, 
And rub your eyes for me, and shake 
My gold, in rising, from your hair, 
A Dana for a moment there. 

   Jenny, my love rang true! for still 
Love at first sight is vague, until 
That tinkling makes him audible. 

   And must I mock you to the last,
Ashamed of my own shame,--aghast 
Because some thoughts not born amiss 
Rose at a poor fair face like this? 
Well, of such thoughts so much I know: 
In my life, as in hers, they show, 
By a far gleam which I may near, 
A dark path I can strive to clear. 

   Only one kiss. Good-bye, my dear.







The Voice
 

Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me,

Saying that now you are not as you were

When you had changed from the one who was all to me,

But as at first, when our day was fair.


Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then,

Standing as when I drew near to the town

Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then,

Even to the original air-blue gown!


Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness

Travelling across the wet mead to me here,

You being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness,

Heard no more again far or near?


      Thus I; faltering forward,

      Leaves around me falling,

Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward,

      And the woman calling.





Long time a child, and still a child, when years
 

Long time a child, and still a child, when years
Had painted manhood on my cheek, was I,--
For yet I lived like one not born to die;
A thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears,
No hope I needed, and I knew no fears.
But sleep, though sweet, is only sleep, and waking,
I waked to sleep no more, at once o'ertaking
The vanguard of my age, with all arrears
Of duty on my back. Nor child, nor man,
Nor youth, nor sage, I find my head is grey,
For I have lost the race I never ran:
A rathe December blights my lagging May;
And still I am a child, tho' I be old,
Time is my debtor for my years untold.





To a Deaf and Dumb Little Girl
 

Like a loose island on the wide expanse,
Unconscious floating on the fickle sea,
Herself her all, she lives in privacy;
Her waking life as lonely as a trance,
Doom'd to behold the universal dance,
And never hear the music which expounds
The solemn step, coy slide, the merry bounds.
The vague, mute language of the countenance.
In vain for her I smooth my antic rhyme;
She cannot hear it. All her little being
Concentrated in her solitary seeing--
What can she know of beauty or sublime?
And yet methinks she looks so calm and good,
God must be with her in her solitude!





Lines
 

I have been cherish'd and forgiven 
    By many tender-hearted, 
'Twas for the sake of one in Heaven 
    Of him that is departed. 

Because I bear my Father's name 
    I am not quite despised, 
My little legacy of fame 
    I've not yet realized. 

And yet if you should praise myself 
    I'll tell you, I had rather 
You'd give your love to me, poor elf, 
    Your praise to my great father. 







Hamatreya
 

Bulkeley, Hunt, Willard, Hosmer, Meriam, Flint, 
Possessed the land which rendered to their toil 
Hay, corn, roots, hemp, flax, apples, wool, and wood. 
Each of these landlords walked amidst his farm, 
Saying, "'Tis mine, my children's and my name's. 
How sweet the west wind sounds in my own trees! 
How graceful climb those shadows on my hill! 
I fancy these pure waters and the flags 
Know me, as does my dog: we sympathize; 
And, I affirm, my actions smack of the soil. 

Where are these men? Asleep beneath their grounds: 
And strangers, fond as they, their furrows plough. 
Earth laughs in flowers, to see her boastful boys 
Earth-proud, proud of the earth which is not theirs; 
Who steer the plough, but cannot steer their feet 
Clear of the grave. 
They added ridge to valley, brook to pond, 
And sighed for all that bounded their domain; 
"This suits me for a pasture; that's my park; 
We must have clay, lime, gravel, granite-ledge, 
And misty lowland, where to go for peat. 
The land is well,--lies fairly to the south. 
'Tis good, when you have crossed the sea and back, 
To find the sitfast acres where you left them. 

Ah! the hot owner sees not Death, who adds 
Him to his land, a lump of mould the more. 
Hear what the Earth say:-- 


                EARTH-SONG 

          "Mine and yours; 
          Mine, not yours. 
          Earth endures; 
          Stars abide-- 
          Shine down in the old sea; 
          Old are the shores; 
          But where are old men? 
          I who have seen much, 
          Such have I never seen. 

          "The lawyer's deed 
          Ran sure, 
          In tail, 
          To them and to their heirs 
          Who shall succeed, 
          Without fail, 
          Forevermore. 

          "Here is the land, 
          Shaggy with wood, 
          With its old valley, 
          Mound and flood. 
          But the heritors?-- 
          Fled like the flood's foam. 
          The lawyer and the laws, 
          And the kingdom, 
          Clean swept herefrom. 

          "They called me theirs, 
          Who so controlled me; 
          Yet every one 
          Wished to stay, and is gone, 
          How am I theirs, 
          If they cannot hold me, 
          But I hold them? 

When I heard the Earth-song 
I was no longer brave; 
My avarice cooled 
Like lust in the chill of the grave. 








Water
 

The water understands 
Civilization well; 
It wets my foot, but prettily, 
It chills my life, but wittily, 
It is not disconcerted, 
It is not broken-hearted: 
Well used, it decketh joy, 
Adorneth, doubleth joy: 
Ill used, it will destroy, 
In perfect time and measure 
With a face of golden pleasure 
Elegantly destroy.





Parks and ponds
 

Parks and ponds are good by day; 
I do not delight 
In black acres of the night, 
Nor my unseasoned step disturbs 
The sleeps of trees or dreams of herbs.





Ode to Beauty
 

Who gave thee, O Beauty, 
The keys of this breast,-- 
Too credulous lover 
Of blest and unblest? 
Say, when in lapsed ages 
Thee knew I of old; 
Or what was the service 
For which I was sold? 
When first my eyes saw thee, 
I found me thy thrall, 
By magical drawings, 
Sweet tyrant of all! 
I drank at thy fountain 
False waters of thirst; 
Thou intimate stranger, 
Thou latest and first! 
Thy dangerous glances 
Make women of men; 
New-born, we are melting 
Into nature again. 

Lavish, lavish promiser, 
Nigh persuading gods to err! 
Guest of million painted forms, 
Which in turn thy glory warms! 
The frailest leaf, the mossy bark, 
The acorn's cup, the raindrop's arc, 
The swinging spider's silver line, 
The ruby of the drop of wine, 
The shining pebble of the pond, 
Thou inscribest with a bond 
In thy momentary play, 
Would bankrupt nature to repay. 

Ah, what avails it 
To hide or to shun 
Whom the Infinite One 
Hath granted his throne? 
The heaven high over 
Is the deep's lover; 
The sun and sea, 
Informed by thee, 
Before me run 
And draw me on, 
Yet fly me still, 
As Fate refuses 
To me the heart Fate for me chooses. 
Is it that my opulent soul 
Was mingled from the generous whole; 
Sea-valleys and the deep of skies 
Furnished several supplies; 
And the sands whereof I'm made 
Draw me to them, self-betrayed? 
I turn the proud portfolio 
Which holds the grand designs 
Of Salvator, of Guercino, 
And Piranesi's lines. 
I hear the lofty paeans 
Of the masters of the shell, 
Who heard the starry music 
And recount the numbers well; 
Olympian bards who sung 
Divine Ideas below, 
Which always find us young 
And always keep us so. 
Oft in streets or humblest places, 
I detect far-wandered graces, 
Which, from Eden wide astray, 
In lowly homes have lost their way. 

Thee gliding through the sea of form, 
Like the lightning through the storm, 
Somewhat not to be possessed, 
Somewhat not to be caressed, 
No feet so fleet could ever find, 
No perfect form could ever bind. 
Thou eternal fugitive, 
Hovering over all that live, 
Quick and skilful to inspire 
Sweet, extravagant desire, 
Starry space and lily-bell 
Filling with thy roseate smell, 
Wilt not give the lips to taste 
Of the nectar which thou hast. 

All that's good and great with thee 
Works in close conspiracy; 
Thou hast bribed the dark and lonely 
To report thy features only, 
And the cold and purple morning 
Itself with thoughts of thee adorning; 
The leafy dell, the city mart, 
Equal trophies of thine art; 
E'en the flowing azure air 
Thou hast touched for my despair; 
And, if I languish into dreams, 
Again I meet the ardent beams. 

Queen of things! I dare not die 
In Being's deeps past ear and eye; 
Lest there I find the same deceiver. 
And be the sport of Fate forever. 
Dread Power, but dear! if God thou be, 
Unmake me quite, or give thyself to me!

Who knows this or that?
Hark in the wall to the rat:
Since the world was, he has gnawed;
Of his wisdom, of his fraud
What dost thou know?
In the wretched little beast
Is life and heart,
Child and parent,
Not without relation
To fruitful field and sun and moon.
What art thou? His wicked eye
Is cruel to thy cruelty.





The Past
 

The debt is paid,
The verdict said,
The Furies laid,
The plague is stayed,
All fortunes made;
Turn the key and bolt the door,
Sweet is death forevermore.
Nor haughty hope, nor swart chagrin,
Nor murdering hate, can enter in.
All is now secure and fast;
Not the gods can shake the Past;
Flies-to the adamantine door
Bolted down forevermore.
None can re-enter there,--
No thief so politic,
No Satan with a royal trick
Steal in by window, chink, or hole,
To bind or unbind, add what lacked,
Insert a leaf, or forge a name,
New-face or finish what is packed,
Alter or mend eternal Fact.

Terminus
 

It is time to be old,
To take in sail:--
The god of bounds,
Who sets to seas a shore,
Came to me in his fatal rounds,
And said: No more!
No farther shoot
Thy broad ambitious branches, and thy root.
Fancy departs: no more invent;
Contract thy firmament 
To compass of a tent.
There's not enough for this and that,
Make thy option which of two;
Economize the failing river,
Not the less revere the Giver,
Leave the many and hold the few.
Timely wise accept the terms,
Soften the fall with wary foot;
A little while
Still plan and smile,
And,--fault of novel germs,--
Mature the unfallen fruit.
Curse, if thou wilt, thy sires,
Bad husbands of their fires,
Who, when they gave thee breath,
Failed to bequeath
The needful sinew stark as once,
The Baresark marrow to thy bones,
But left a legacy of ebbing veins,
Inconstant heat and nerveless reins,--
Amid the Muses, left thee deaf and dumb,
Amid the gladiators, halt and numb.

   As the bird trims her to the gale,
I trim myself to the storm of time,
I man the rudder, reef the sail,
Obey the voice at eve obeyed at prime:
Lowly faithful, banish fear,
Right onward drive unharmed;
The port, well worth the cruise, is near,
And every wave is charmed.

The moon now rises to her absolute rule
 

The moon now rises to her absolute rule, 
And the husbandman and hunter 
Acknowledge her for their mistress. 
Asters and golden reign in the fields 
And the life everlasting withers not. 
The fields are reaped and shorn of their pride 
But an inward verdure still crowns them; 
The thistle scatters its down on the pool 
And yellow leaves clothe the river-- 
And nought disturbs the serious life of men. 
But behind the sheaves and under the sod 
There lurks a ripe fruit which the reapers have not gathered, 
The true harvest of the year--the boreal fruit 
Which it bears forever, 
With fondness annually watering and maturing it. 
But man never severs the stalk 
Which bears this palatable fruit.





To a Marsh Hawk in Spring
 

There is health in thy gray wing,
Health of nature's furnishing.
Say, thou modern-winged antique,
Was thy mistress ever sick?
In each heaving of thy wing
Thou dost health and leisure bring,
Thou dost waive disease and pain
And resume new life again.

Tall Ambrosia
 

Among the signs of autumn I perceive 
The Roman wormwood (called by learned men 
Ambrosia elatior, food for gods,-- 
For to impartial science the humblest weed 
Is as immortal once as the proudest flower--) 
Sprinkles its yellow dust over my shoes 
As I cross the now neglected garden. 
--We trample under foot the food of gods 
And spill their nectar in each drop of dew-- 
My honest shoes, fast friends that never stray 
Far from my couch, thus powdered, countryfied, 
Bearing many a mile the marks of their adventure, 
At the post-house disgrace the Gallic gloss 
Of those well dressed ones who no morning dew 
Nor Roman wormwood ever have been through, 
Who never walk but are transported rather-- 
For what old crime of theirs I do not gather. 








I Was Made Erect and Lone
 

I was made erect and lone, 
And within me is the bone; 
Still my vision will be clear, 
Still my life will not be drear, 
To the center all is near. 
Where I sit there is my throne. 
If age choose to sit apart, 
If age choose, give me the start, 
Take the sap and leave the heart. 







Im thankful that my life doth not deceive
 

I'm thankful that my life doth not deceive
Itself with a low loftiness, half height,
And think it soars when still it dip its way
Beneath the clouds on noiseless pinion
Like the crow or owl, but it doth know
The full extent of all its trivialness,
Compared with the splendid heights above.
   See how it waits to watch the mail come in
While 'hind its back the sun goes out perchance.
And yet their lumbering cart brings me no word,
Not one scrawled leaf such as my neighbors get
To cheer them with the slight events forsooth,
Faint ups and downs of their far distant friends--
And now 'tis passed. What next? See the long train
Of teams wreathed in dust, their atmosphere;
Shall I attend until the last is passed?
Else why these ears that hear the leader's bells
Or eyes that link me in procession?
But hark! the drowsy day has done its task,
Far in yon hazy field where stands a barn,
Unanxious hens improve the sultry hour
And with contented voice now brag their deed--
A new laid egg--Now let the day decline--
They'll lay another by tomorrow's sun.







Zun-zet
 

Where the western zun, unclouded,
   Up above the grey hill-tops,
Did sheen drough ashes, lofty sh'ouded,
   On the turf beside the copse,
      In zummer weather,
      We together,
      Sorrow-slightn, work-vorgettn,
      Gambol'd wi' the zun a-zettn.

There, by flow'ry bows o' bramble,
   Under hedge, in ash-tree shedes,
The dun-heir'd ho'se did slowly ramble
   On the grasses' dewy bledes,
      Zet free o' lwoads,
      An' stwony rwoads,
      Vorgetvul o' the lashes frettn,
      Grazn wi' the zun a-zettn.

There wer rooks a-betn by us
   Drough the ar, in a vlock,
An' there the lively blackbird, nigh us,
   On the meple bough did rock,
      Wi' ringn droat,
      Where zunlight smote
      The yollow boughs o' zunny hedges
      Over western hills' blue edges.

Waters, drough the meds a-purln,
   Glissen'd in the evenn's light,
An' smoke, above the town a-curln,
   Melted slowly out o' zight;
      An' there, in glooms
      Ov unzunn'd rooms,
      To zome, wi' idle sorrows frettn,
      Zuns did set avore their zettn.

We were out in gemes and reces,
   Loud a-laughn, wild in me'th,
Wi' windblown heir, an' zunbrowned feces,
   Lepn on the high-sky'd e'th,
      Avore the lights
      Wer tin'd o' nights,
      An' while the gossamer's light nettn
      Sparkled to the zun a-zettn.







The Clote (Water-Lily)
 

O zummer clote! when the brook's a-glidn 
   So slow an' smooth down his zedgy bed, 
Upon thy broad leaves so sefe a-ridn 
   The water's top wi' thy yollow head, 
          By alder shedes, O, 
          An' bulrush beds, O, 
Thou then dost float, goolden zummer clote! 

The grey-bough'd withy's a lenn lowly 
   Above the water thy leaves do hide; 
The bnden bulrush, a-swan slowly, 
   Do skirt in zummer thy river's zide; 
          An' perch in shoals, O, 
          Do vill the holes, O, 
Where thou dost float, goolden zummer clote! 

Oh! when thy brook-drinkn flow'r's a-blown, 
   The burnn zummer's a-zettn in; 
The time o' greenness, the time o' mown, 
   When in the hy-vield, wi' zunburnt skin, 
          The vo'k do drink, O, 
          Upon the brink, O, 
Where thou dost float, goolden zummer clote! 

Wi' erms a-spreadn, an' cheks a-blown, 
   How proud wer I when I vu'st could swim 
Athirt the deep plece where thou bist grown, 
   Wi' thy long more vrom the bottom dim; 
          While cows, knee-high, O, 
          In brook, wer nigh, O, 
Where thou dost float, goolden zummer clote! 

Ov all the brooks drough the meds a-windn, 
   Ov all the meds by a river's brim, 
There's nwone so feir o' my own heart's vindn 
   As where the madens do zee thee zwim, 
          An' stan' to teke, O, 
          Wi' long-stemm'd reke, O, 
Thy flow'r afloat, goolden zummer clote! 







The Wind at the Door
 

As day did darken on the dewless grass,
There, still, wi' nwone a-come by me
To stay a-while at hwome by me
Within the house, all dumb by me,
I zot me sad as the eventide did pass.

An' there a win'blast shook the rattln door,
An' seemed, as win' did mwoan without,
As if my Jene, alwone without,
A-stannn on the stwone without,
Wer there a-come wi' happiness oonce mwore.

I went to door; an' out vrom trees above
My head, upon the blast by me,
Sweet blossoms wer a-cast by me,
As if my Love, a-past by me,
Did fling em down--a token ov her love.

Sweet blossoms o' the tree where I do murn,
I thought, if you did blow vor her,
Vor apples that should grow vor her,
A-valln down below vor her,
O then how happy I should zee you kern!

But no. Too soon I voun my charm a-broke.
Noo comely soul in white like her--
Noo soul a-steppn light like her--
An' nwone o' comely height like her
Went by; but all my grief agen awoke.







Tokens
 

Green mwold on zummer bars do show
   That they've a-dripp'd in winter wet;
The hoof-worn ring o' groun' below
   The tree, do tell o' storms or het;
The trees in rank along a ledge
Do show where woonce did bloom a hedge;
An' where the vurrow-marks do stripe
The down, the wheat woonce rustled ripe.
Each mark ov things a-gone vrom view--
To eyezight's woone, to soulzight two.

The grass agen the mwoldrn door
   'S a tken sad o' vo'k a-gone,
An' where the house, bwoth wall an' vloor,
   'S a-lost, the well mid linger on.
What tokens, then, could Mery gi'e
That she'd a-liv'd, an' liv'd vor me,
But things a-done vor thought an' view?
Good things that nwone agen can do,
An' every work her love ha' wrought
To eyezight's woone, but two to thought.







The Fall
 

The length o' days agen do shrink 
   An' flowers be thin in med, among 
   The eegrass a-sheenn bright, along 
Brook upon brook, an' brink by brink. 

   Noo starlns do rise in vlock on wing-- 
   Noo goocoo in nest-green leaves do sound-- 
   Noo swallows be now a-wheeln round-- 
Dip after dip, an' swing by swing. 

   The wheat that did letely rustle thick 
   Is now up in mows that still be new, 
   An' yollow bevore the sky o' blue-- 
Tip after tip, an' rick by rick. 

   While now I can walk a dusty mile 
   I'll teke me a day, while days be clear, 
   To vind a vew friends that still be dear, 
Fece after fece, an' smile by smile. 







The Haunted Palace
 

In the greenest of our valleys
   By good angels tenanted,
Once a fair and stately palace--
   Radiant palace--reared its head.
In the monarch Thought's dominion,
   It stood there!
Never seraph spread a pinion
   Over fabric half so fair!

Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
   On its roof did float and flow
(This--all this--was in the olden
   Time long ago)
And every gentle air that dallied,
   In that sweet day,
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
   A wingd odor went away.

Wanderers in that happy valley,
   Through two luminous windows, saw
Spirits moving musically
   To a lute's well-tund law,
Round about a throne where, sitting,
   Porphyrogene!
In state his glory well befitting,
   The ruler of the realm was seen.

And all with pearl and ruby glowing
   Was the fair palace door,
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing
   And sparkling evermore,
A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
   Was but to sing,
In voices of surpassing beauty,
   The wit and wisdom of their king.

But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
   Assailed the monarch's high estate;
(Ah, let us mourn!--for never morrow
   Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)
And round about his home the glory
   That blushed and bloomed
Is but a dim-remembered story
   Of the old time entombed.

And travellers, now, within that valley,
   Through the red-litten windows see
Vast forms that move fantastically
   To a discordant melody;
While, like a ghastly rapid river,
   Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever,
   And laugh--but smile no more.







from The Lady of the Lake: Boat Song
 

Hail to the Chief who in triumph advances! 
   Honored and blessed be the ever-green Pine! 
Long may the tree, in his banner that glances, 
   Flourish, the shelter and grace of our line! 
      Heaven sent it happy dew, 
      Earth lend it sap anew, 
   Gayly to bourgeon and broadly to grow, 
      While every Highland glen 
      Sends our shout back again, 
   "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe! 

Ours is no sapling, chance-sown by the fountain, 
   Blooming at Beltane, in winter to fade; 
When the whirlwind has stripped every leaf on the mountain, 
   The more shall Clan-Alpine exult in her shade. 
      Moored in the rifted rock, 
      Proof to the tempest's shock, 
   Firmer he roots him the ruder it blow; 
      Menteith and Breadalbane, then, 
      Echo his praise again, 
   "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe! 

Proudly our pibroch has thrilled in Glen Fruin, 
   And Bannochar's groans to our slogan replied; 
Glen-Luss and Ross-dhu, they are smoking in ruin, 
   And the best of Loch Lomond lie dead on her side. 
      Widow and Saxon maid 
      Long shall lament our raid, 
   Think of Clan-Alpine with fear and with woe; 
      Lennox and Leven-glen 
      Shake when they hear again, 
   "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe! 

Row, vassals, row, for the pride of the Highlands! 
   Stretch to your oars for the ever-green Pine! 
O that the rosebud that graces yon islands 
   Were wreathed in a garland around him to twine! 
      O that some seedling gem, 
      Worthy such noble stem 
   Honored and blessed in their shadow might grow! 
      Loud should Clan-Alpine then 
      Ring from her deepmost glen, 
   "Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho! ieroe!





from The Lady of the Lake: The Western Waves of Ebbing Day
 

The western waves of ebbing day 
Rolled o'er the glen their level way; 
Each purple peak, each flinty spire, 
Was bathed in floods of living fire. 
But not a setting beam could glow 
Within the dark ravines below, 
Where twined the path in shadow hid, 
Round many a rocky pyramid, 
Shooting abruptly from the dell 
Its thunder-splintered pinnacle; 
Round many an insulated mass, 
The native bulwarks of the pass, 
Huge as the tower which builders vain 
Presumptuous piled on Shinar's plain. 
The rocky summits, split and rent, 
Formed turret, dome, or battlement, 
Or seemed fantastically set 
With cupola or minaret, 
Wild crests as pagod ever decked, 
Or mosque of Eastern architect. 
Nor were these earth-born castles bare, 
Nor lacked they many a banner fair; 
For, from their shivered brows displayed, 
Far o'er the unfathomable glade, 
All twinkling with the dewdrop sheen, 
The brier-rose fell in streamers green, 
And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes, 
Waved in the west-wind's summer sighs. 

Boon nature scattered, free and wild, 
Each plant or flower, the mountain's child. 
Here eglantine embalmed the air, 
Hawthorn and hazel mingled there; 
The primrose pale, and violet flower, 
Found in each cliff a narrow bower; 
Fox-glove and night-shade, side by side, 
Emblems of punishment and pride, 
Grouped their dark hues with every stain 
The weather-beaten crags retain. 
With boughs that quaked at every breath, 
Gray birch and aspen wept beneath; 
Aloft, the ash and warrior oak 
Cast anchor in the rifted rock; 
And, higher yet, the pine-tree hung 
His shattered trunk, and frequent flung, 
Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high, 
His boughs athwart the narrowed sky. 
Highest of all, where white peaks glanced, 
Where glist'ning streamers waved and danced, 
The wanderer's eye could barely view 
The summer heaven's delicious blue; 
So wondrous wild, the whole might seem 
The scenery of a fairy dream. 

Onward, amid the copse 'gan peep 
A narrow inlet, still and deep, 
Affording scarce such breadth of brim 
As served the wild duck's brood to swim. 
Lost for a space, through thickets veering, 
But broader when again appearing, 
Tall rocks and tufted knolls their face 
Could on the dark-blue mirror trace; 
And farther as the hunter strayed, 
Still broader sweep its channels made. 
The shaggy mounds no longer stood, 
Emerging from entangled wood, 
But, wave-encircled, seemed to float, 
Like castle girdled with its moat; 
Yet broader floods extending still 
Divide them from their parent hill, 
Till each, retiring, claims to be 
An islet in an inland sea. 

And now, to issue from the glen, 
No pathway meets the wanderer's ken, 
Unless he climb, with footing nice 
A far projecting precipice. 
The broom's tough roots his ladder made, 
The hazel saplings lent their aid; 
And thus an airy point he won, 
Where, gleaming with the setting sun, 
One burnished sheet of living gold, 
Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled, 
In all her length far winding lay, 
With promontory, creek, and bay, 
And islands that, empurpled bright, 
Floated amid the livelier light, 
And mountains, that like giants stand, 
To sentinel enchanted land. 
High on the south, huge Benvenue 
Down to the lake in masses threw 
Crags, knolls, and mountains, confusedly hurled, 
The fragments of an earlier world; 
A wildering forest feathered o'er 
His ruined sides and summit hoar, 
While on the north, through middle air, 
Ben-an heaved high his forehead bare. 







Lava and Sand
 

The soil I'm walking over comes   

from deeper: a fire had done it in,   
a stewpot had suddenly popped   
and its contents streamed   
out wave over wave until   
it reached the water, until the sea   
called it a day and struck back   

with a counterwave. Stony nightblack   
dreambarren land where tawny   
thyme wrestles up and thistle is stitched   
to every bare thing. Over this malevolence   
I carry you in me,   
sevenmonths deadchild, out to the sea





Last Night
 

Saved two children last night.
They lay under thin black ice
one gone blue, the other grey.
I laid them out on grass
that snapped under my step
wrung their bodies warm and dry
gave them the gust of my breath. 

Then I looked out at the morning
that lay lukewarm on the water
put on a tank top
arranged some grasses in a vase
fished two children out of sleep.





Backside
 

Night eats color,   
Flower bouquets lose their fake ornaments.   
Day falls into the leaves like sparkling fish   
And struggles, like the lowly mud,   
The shapeless dreams and trees   
Nurtured outside this shriveled, deridable despair.   
And the space that was chopped down   
Tickles the weeds there by its feet.   
Fingers stained with tar from cigarettes   
Caress the writhing darkness.   
And then the people move forward.





Coal Deliveryman
 

Like finding a bar of aluminum wedged in a bull's jaw. Like discovering in a sea chest a short obsidian head. Like looking through a padlock   and seeing an undeserved dawn. As impossible as all these, as melancholy and lonely, was it to see the green truck that with the punctuality   of a sacrament delivered the coal each month. On the slope its strained   heart would announce itself vociferously, at the brink of death, and it   would stop in front of the house as if to deliver the agonizing news of   the fall of Troy. And then a man, wrapped in sacking, would pitch   his cargo, resonant and angular, into an orange-painted crate.
 
Like opening a Bible and finding three leaves of laurel. Like lifting   a stone and remembering someone's name. Like finding the same   snail again a hundred miles away. As impossible as all these, as melancholy and lonely, would it be to find, fifteen years later, the same coal    deliveryman carrying on his trade, bent from the strain, determined   to show the heavens that a man might do that job his entire life, that   he scraped in the mines, that he stole thread from his wife to sew his   sacking, that he dreamed of infinite excavations, of tunnels, and that   they might forgive him for not having done more than that.






Sonnet of the Seven Chinese
 

The Augsburg poet once said he had tacked   
an image of the Man of Doubt   
to the wall of his room. A Chinese print.   
The image asked: how ought one to act?   

I have a photo on my wall. Twenty years ago   
seven Chinese workers looked into my lens.   
They look wary or ironic or tense.   
They know I do not write for them. I know   

they didn't live for me. Yet sometimes I feel   
I'm being asked for more candid words,   
more credible deeds, by their doubtfulness.   

In turn I ask their help in making visible   
the contradictions and identities among us.   
If there's a point, it's this.





from Curriculum Vitae
 

          
          Master Hirano came from Japan together with a priest from the Kegon sect and the two of them drank beer all night at the Avia Hotel next to Ben Gurion airport.       The following day, when we came to take them to the Galilee, they had trouble getting up and barely checked out of their rooms on time.       It was a wintry January morning, and near the village of Shefaram the priest from the Kegon sect asked us to stop and stood by the side of the road and urinated.  On Friday the two of them (Master Hirano and the priest from the Kegon sect) went to the Bratslav Hasids' synagogue in Safed. The worshippers swayed like trees in the wind. Master Hirano and the priest from the Kegon sect stood there, bald and wrapped in robes, behind the congregation, and the beadle whispered into our ears: Are they Jews? Are they Jews?     When we left the synagogue Master Hirano said to the priest from the Kegon sect: There is no doubt that they understand what devotion (he said shujaku) is. The priest from the Kegon sect said: There is no doubt. They know what devotion is.       On Jerusalem Street, by the monument of the mortar, commemorating the '48 war, Master Hirano said: Prayer is a good thing. The priest from the Kegon sect said: There is no doubt. Prayer is a good thing.       Master Hirano stood on one side of the mortar and the priest from the Kegon sect stood on the other and the moon rose, big and full, yellow like the fields painted by Van Gogh.  * * *  It's possible to write only by means of non-writing.

We'll lead it toward the right place (which is to say, the yogurt) and from there toward the mouth. But the mouth can't be fathomed. Likewise the word that stands for it (mouth) is strange in the extreme.       Or take, for example, the hand that's holding the spoon with its five tragic fingers. There's no logic whatsoever in there being five. Like five widows who've gathered because their husbands have died, and they allow themselves this movement through the air in order to keep from losing their minds.  There is no limit to the beauty of things that are sad. Like old clay vases or a wagon's shaft in a junkyard. Every year the plum trees flower anew, and people whose names are Shtiasni or Dahaan open doors and close them.       All these things fill the heart with great joy. The beauty of death and the violet colors accompanying it. Announcements that make nothing dawn on one, and the dawn itself rising from nowhere like a birthday present 365 days a year.
        




Stanzas
 

In memory of my mother
I 

Speak then. What is it you wanted to say? Was it the way   
The barge slid down the city river in sunset's pursuit,   
Two thirds of June passed, the twenty-second today   
And summer on tiptoes, in an effort to stretch to the light,   
How the linden trees breathed through the stifling square   
And in July there was thundering, mumbling from every direction?   
But that speech needed gravity, needed some weight at its core   
And not lightness--that, I'm afraid, was deception.   

II 

Can you smell it: how sweet-rotting melon scented the greengrocer's store   
Out of sight in the archway the crashing of empty crates   
On a breeze from the outskirts, the handcars' jostling call   
And an archive of leaf-fall covered the pavements' gray.   
Let the Rubik's Cube fall from your hand, it is not worth the strain   
All effortful planning in vain, take the grapes, eat your fill   
In the quiet backyard on a bench, see for real, there in the rain   
What will come to your mind in the hills and the hollows of hell. 

III 

And go now, where you were going. But your nights here, in rain   
Especially in rain, the steady bare branch of the upas tree   
Learnt to death like the alphabet, feels for the window pane-- 
G for glass, touching the frame, the words you heard at her knee   
And although I learnt little at school, I see as if it were now   
Through the flask's throat and falling from above to beneath   
With an unforgettable shivering, the fine sand heaping below.   
The simplest device, but such an opening for grief.   

IV 

You're done for, you deceiver, you cheat, with the tottering   
Tripod, your cunning replete, beat your rage on the floor like a staff   
That a stream might come forth, ghostly, transparent and blossoming   
With the odor of ozone under the municipal office tin roof.   
The soft furnishings sting you with static--then resound,   
Speak again, as if under duress, without manifesto or school   
If these terrible times, this place the Lord has renounced   
Can fill with such love, the straggler, the spent force that is you. 

V 

Aged forty-seven and widowed, Aizenstadt, shuffling, feels   
His way round the kitchen to the empty medicine chest   
Is there anything to raise a smile or a glass to here?   
Not even the comical long johns, in mourning and flapping half-mast.   
This place, where a good time means down in the yard by the crates   
Drinking with the men who have seen a good thing or two,   
Making toasts to Esenin and Chenier as if they were once mates   
And another wage packet spent like the last one on booze.      

VI 

After death I will leave my beloved city and there, without,   
I will lift my throat to the heavens, my horns tipped back to the earth,   
And marked by my sorrow I will give forth from my trumpeting mouth   
To sound through the autumn wastes, the truths for which speech had no words.   
How the barge was drawn down the river by sunset's last fingering ray   
How, on my left wrist, time's steel cooled and hissed   
How the magic door was unlocked with an ordinary key   
Speak. Such misfortune leaves us little else.





The Love of an Orange
 

An orange did love   
The man who ate it.   
A feast for the eyes   
Is a fine repast;   
Its heart held fast   
His greedy gaze.   

A citron did scold:   
I am wiser than thou.   
A cedar condoled:   
Indeed thou shalt die!   
And who can revive   
A withered bough?   

The citron did urge:   
O fool, be wise.   
The cedar did rage:   
Slander and sin!   
Repent of thy ways   
For a fool I despise.   

An orange did love   
With life and limb   
The man who ate it,   
The man who flayed it.   

An orange did love   
The man who ate it,   
To its flayer it brought   
Flesh for the teeth.   

An orange, consumed   
By the man who ate it,   
Invaded his skin   
To the flesh beneath.





The Second Trying
 

If I could only get hold of the whole of you,   
How could I ever get hold of the whole of you,   
Even more than the most beloved idols,   
More than mountains quarried whole,   
          More than mines   
          Of burning coal,   
Let's say mines of extinguished coal   
And the breath of day like a fiery furnace.   

If one could get hold of you for all the years,   
How could one get hold of you from all the years,   
How could one lengthen a single arm,   
Like a single branch of an African river,   
As one sees in a dream the Bay of Storms,   
As one sees in a dream a ship that went down,   
The way one imagines a cushion of clouds,   
Lily-clouds as the body's cushion,   
But though you will it, they will not convey you,   
Do not believe that they will convey you.   

If one could get hold of all-of-the-whole-of-you,   
If one could get hold of you like metal,   
Say like pillars of copper,   
Say like a pillar of purple copper   
(That pillar I remembered last summer)-- 
And the bottom of the ocean I have never seen,   
And the bottom of the ocean that I can see   
With its thousand heavy thickets of air,   
A thousand and one laden breaths.   

If one could only get hold of the-whole-of-you-now,   
How could you ever be for me what I myself am?   






[Long Neglect Has Worn Away]
 

Long neglect has worn away
Half the sweet enchanting smile;
Time has turned the bloom to gray;
Mold and damp the face defile.

But that lock of silky hair,
Still beneath the picture twined,
Tells what once those features were,
Paints their image on the mind.

Fair the hand that traced that line,
Dearest, ever deem me true;
Swiftly flew the fingers fine
When the pen that motto drew.







Island (#2)
 

You're right    in life's chamber music   
either listen with total attention    or else switch off   
Water    one drop can perfectly lock up these shores   

The crash of waves has no gap    is like a tailored body   
still sitting on the rock    the lilac-scented surrounding ocean   
still striking at a little girl's unceasing gaze into distance   

Purple or white    petals are stored in the eyes   
all through the springtime night, dark rings around the eyes   
keep opening    torn by where she looks far away   

Suffering is that waiting, underwater pearl   
what turns old is salt    low sobbing in every wave   
The fierce wind is a jade bracelet on the wrist   

Island    like a boat sailing since the day you were born   
never slowing down its disconsolate speed   
always arriving yet, underfoot, drawn away by the ebbing tide   

Purple    wounds the turbulent, close-up scene   
sets off white    the horizon like land cutting, above snow line, into fate   
exposing the snow flower you've caught for life   

Still wet    tears run halfway down the girl's cheeks   
After so many years play the cold rain you've brought back   
A seagull plunges    then flies back up    You hear clearly this kiss





A Pedal-Pusher Said to Me
 

A pedal-pusher said to me   
No braykaiser   
No sterfput   
A-stepping and a-stoumping cretin-wise   
Could drive a man to madness   
Just as no thousand Orphas all draped in damp peignoirs   
Doing their great kochera   
With the prima donna   
Of Iquzegdamoda   
Of Paczevast   
Of Anunec   
Each Orpha in an evening gown   
Imploring of our pedal-pusher   
To go a-step and go a-stoump all over yet again   
With a thousand mops   
And a thousand sterfputs imploring them   
The braykaiser in me   
The sterfput in me   
The mop in me   
The kochera in me   
The Paczevast in me   
The Anunec in me   
The Iquzegdamoda in me   
And all the stoumpers   
The steppers   
The mops   
The evening gowns   
And all the Orphas   
All the pedal-pushers   
The damp peignoirs   
The cretins   
The prima donnas   
Who beg   
The kocheras   
The Iquzegdamodas 
The Anunecs   
And all the Paczevasts   
To step   
And to stoump for the sake of love   
The great flowering love   
Of a thousand pedal-pushers   
A-draped in damp peignoirs   
Will lead no braykaiser   
No sterfput   
No mop   
No kochera   
No Paczevast   
No Anunec   
No Iquzegdamoda   
To implore a man to madness   
And that is what a-stepping and a-stoumping cretin-wise   
A pedal-pusher said to me

Not-Orpheus is singing   He sings his nothing   He sings his night   
He sings all the names   The name of nothing   The only name    Since   
long ago   He didn't know it   And knew it in his night   
All things sing   All names sing   Every tonal difference, every
sound   All music in its destruction   In its sublation   Toward which point?
The mountain of nothing hovers   Before it crushes us   With its night   With its
   song   

In the evening I walked through town with you, Dearest, along the river   
A clear cold spring evening, the half-moon shone   As if walking in a foreign city   
Though I recognized parts of it   You said it was almost like   
walking in Prague, where we would have been if my mother hadn't fallen ill   
When we stood by one corner of the Hotel Svea, where I played in a dance band in 
    1957,   
the huge flock of jackdaws, in the trees by the bastion near the castle, flew   
out over the river, in micropolyphonic conversation    As in a piece by Ligeti   
That night I dreamed I crossed a bridge spanning the river, now very broad   
The long bridge was swaying, huge ocean swells entering the river from the sea   
I walked with a girl, kissed her on the mouth, on the opposite bank   
In the morning you came into my bed, Dear, we slinked like teenagers, so my   
       mother wouldn't hear us, 
where she slept, in the room outside ours   She's already much better   
I look at my face in the bathroom mirror   Will I manage to go out into the Brain   

Trucks pass   Traffic goes on, in the great exchange of goods   
Gulls, trees, people   The degree of virtuality in different goods, the phantasms   
also in what we eat, conceptions of origin, contents, effects
Fear    Cultivated tastes    We are in the immediacy of memory    Only in a flash of
astonishment can memory be broken   But even lightning is informed    I look at 
    the 
      magical   
diagrams of Giordano Bruno, read his texts   See that all this is exactly as in   
Jung, fundamental magical forms, for guiding the divine,   
the unknown within the soul   Also the similarity with tantric forms      
    Yes, that's   
        how it is,   
I think, both Freud and Jung are magicians, the difference in rationality is   
only marginal, Jung's a little older, Freud's more modern, a continuation of   
Descartes, developed later in Spinoza's pneumatic model for the passions,   
and yet both are found, subsumed in Bruno's love-flow, the lineage backward,   
the tantric flow, also Plato's Diotima, her flow . . .   
Hlderlin saw the stream of people in dark water, streaming over   
the ledges in the human-geological world, the levels of the abyss,   Para-   
       dise's various degrees of stasis   
What use can I make of these magical forms? I'm no magician    And yet 
I acknowledge their power, also within my self   If they prevail, sovereignty   
is crushed   Libero arbitrio   There the forms also break down   
The stream of love breaks down    Fluid lightning    The flash of vibrating being   
But also the flash of darkness   The light of Beatrice's eyes, their lightning 
    flash   How   
am I to understand this? How to understand unknowing   That I do not!





Inventory
 

This is my cap,   
this is my overcoat,   
here is my shave kit   
in its linen pouch.   

Some field rations:   
my dish, my tumbler,   
here in the tin-plate   
I've scratched my name.   

Scratched it here with this   
precious nail   
I keep concealed   
from coveting eyes.   

In the bread bag I have   
a pair of wool socks   
and a few things that I   
discuss with no one,   

and these form a pillow   
for my head at night.    
Some cardboard lies   
between me and the ground.    

The pencil's the thing   
I love the most:   
By day it writes verses   
I make up at night.    

This is my notebook,   
this my rain gear,   
this is my towel,   
this is my twine.





"Yet to die. Unalone still.
 

Yet to die. Unalone still.
For now your pauper-friend is with you.
Together you delight in the grandeur of the plains,
And the dark, the cold, the storms of snow.

Live quiet and consoled
In gaudy poverty, in powerful destitution.  
Blessed are those days and nights.   
The work of this sweet voice is without sin.   

Misery is he whom, like a shadow,   
A dog's barking frightens, the wind cuts down.   
Poor is he who, half-alive himself   
Begs his shade for pittance.

"Alone I stare into the  frosts white face
 

Alone I stare into the frost's white face.   
It's going nowhere, and I--from nowhere.   
Everything ironed flat, pleated without a wrinkle:   
Miraculous, the breathing plain.   

Meanwhile the sun squints at this starched poverty-- 
The squint itself consoled, at ease . . .   
The ten-fold forest almost the same . . .   
And snow crunches in the eyes, innocent, like clean bread.

Whose velvet down, whose feather are you, whose rejoicing song?

FROM YANNIS PAVLAKIS'S CRETAN FOLK POETRY COLLECTION   

Take a look around you when the trees are all in bloom,   
And wonder why you've chosen that old desiccated broom.

The everything of the world is zero, the life of the world is naught;   
It is from nothing to nothing that eternity is wrought.

When they open wide the church door to bear his body hither,   
I'll drag forth such a savage cry the wild greens will wither.

I want my darling filthy--it's the dirty girl I trust-- 
To keep her to myself and make the rest flee in disgust!

There is a sheer cliff at the end of the foot-path of our lives,   
But he whose soul possesses wings unfurls them and survives.

Five thousand dreams I fashioned every hour of every day,   
But then along came wind and rain to sweep them all away.

Deep underground where no sun rises, no moon shines above,   
That is the place where he must dwell, the man who loses love.

Heart, break. Flesh, decompose. And Soul, desert the body's frame.   
Since you denied me, go back to the dirt from which you came.





"Ah Margarida
 

Ah Margarida,   
If I gave you my life,   
What would you do with it?   
       I'd take my earrings out of hock, 
       Marry a blind man,  
       And live on a tree-lined block. 
         
But Margarida,   
If I gave you my life,   
What would your mother say?   
       (Her mother knows me inside out.)   
       She'd say you're a fool,  
       Without a doubt. 

And Margarida,   
If I gave you my life   
Literally, by dying?   
       I'd go to your funeral, firmly believing  
       You'd gone mad  
       To try to love by not living. 
         
But Margarida,   
If this giving of my life to you   
Were merely poetry?   
       In that case, forget it,  
       The deal's off, 
       Because I don't sell on credit.

"So many gods!
 

So many gods!   
They're like books--you can't read everything, you never know anything.   
Happy the man who knows but one god, and keeps him a secret.   
Every day I have different beliefs-- 
Sometimes in the same day I have different beliefs-- 
And I wish I were the child now crossing   
The view from my window of the street below.   
He's eating a cheap pastry (he's poor) without efficient or final cause,   
An animal uselessly raised above the other vertebrates,   
And through his teeth he sings a ribald show tune . . .   
Yes, there are many gods,   
But I'd give anything to the one who'd take that child out of my sight.

Prophecy
 

One day the Earth will be   
just a blind space turning,   
night confused with day.   
Under the vast Andean sky   
there'll be no more mountains,   
not a rock or ravine.   

Only one balcony will remain   
of all the world's buildings,   
and of the human mappa mundi,   
limitless sorrow.   
In place of the Atlantic Ocean,   
a little saltiness in the air,   
and a fish, flying and magical   
with no knowledge of the sea.   

In a car of the 1900s (no road   
for its wheels) three girls   
of that time, pressing onwards   
like ghosts in the fog.   
They'll peer through the door   
thinking they're nearing Paris   
when the odor of the sky   
grips them by the throat.   

Instead of a forest   
there'll be one bird singing,   
which nobody will ever place,   
or prefer, or even hear.   
Except for God, who listening out,   
proclaims it a goldfinch.   






"No, I wasnt meant to love and be loved
 

No, I wasn't meant to love and be loved.   
If I'd lived longer, I would have waited longer.   

Knowing you are faithless keeps me alive and hungry.   
Knowing you faithful would kill me with joy.   

Delicate are you, and your vows are delicate, too,   
so easily do they break.   

You are a laconic marksman. You leave me   
not dead but perpetually dying.   

I want my friends to heal me, succor me.   
Instead, I get analysis.   

Conflagrations that would make stones drip blood   
are campfires compared to my anguish.   

Two-headed, inescapable anguish!-- 
Love's anguish or the anguish of time.   

Another dark, severing, incommunicable night.   
Death would be fine, if I only died once.   

I would have liked a solitary death,   
not this lavish funeral, this grave anyone can visit.   

You are mystical, Ghalib, and, also, you speak beautifully.   
Are you a saint, or just drunk as usual?   







What I Know
 

          
          1. I know that language is within the world and that, at the same time, the world is within language. I know we are at the border between language and the world.     2. I don't like phrases such as "nothing new under the sun or "it's all been said already. I know that at every moment we could affirm: "everything is always new under the sun or "almost nothing has yet been said of what could be said.    3. I know that there's no true coherence except in apparent incoherence. Every object clothes itself in chaos. To take shape, every thought must manage its own vagueness.    4. Among the obvious: I know that every human activity consists, one way or another, of battling death.    5. I know that time is bound up with space. Time is the shadow of space. Space the shadow of time. I know that we live in the shadow of a shadow and that it returns to the light.     6. I know that I know nothing about love.    7. I know that I live not in the world, but in the shadow of the world. I know that I go through the world the way an insect goes through its entire life in the shadow of a bank.    8. I know that nothing is simple. Or more, that what's simple is never truly, never completely, so. I know that everything adds up and that every element of this total depends on the whole.    9. I know that everything around me is nothing but a mass of contingency. I know that every word props itself up on an immense architecture of contingency.  10. I know that thunder comes after lightning and sometimes, in my dreams, thunder precedes lightning. I know that to see its opposite simultaneously with every phenomenon you must widen your eyes.    11. I know that whoever finds himself loses himself a little.    12. I know that I love a woman enormously, but I don't know which one.    13. I know that to talk is to walk a path with emptiness to the right and emptiness to the left. I know that nothing can grasp this path with two ends. I know that writing is talking in frozen time.    14. I know that the word "table is like a thousand tables. That a phrase is like a thousand thousand phrases. And that thinking is a match for water sports.     15. I know that every authentic poet is in decay.    16. To read isn't necessarily to analyze, is not necessarily "to understand. At the swimming pool, we don't ask the swimmer the composition of the water, the number and distribution of swimmers, or why he's picked this date to go swimming. We don't ask him to describe, in mid-crawl, the architecture or acoustics of the place, or to explain a bird trapped under its roof, or to do a better imitation of the progress of some Olympic seal. We don't ask him to memorize opening hours or screw himself up by whistling from the bench throughout an entire race in butterfly stroke. No. Finally, we don't ask him, before each dive, to bring up some secret meaning from the very bottom of the pool. No. We let swimmers swim. We let swimmers swim. And the swimming pools fill up.    17. I know that I live and think inside a storehouse of books. Some recent, new, remarkable books, but in the great majority books which are decayed, moldy, have turned to the lightest heaps of dust. Only their metal frames and some fine particles of knowledge remain, unusable. Light from a few windows crosses the storehouse unimpeded.    18. Having found some daguerreotypes on the floor of an attic--portraits eroded by time and light--I know that forgetting is something enormous, that forgetting is our highest destiny.    19. I know that God doesn't exist. That's written everywhere in the storehouse--it can be made out through the portholes, too. I know that after death there's nothing but death.    20. I know that, seen from the border between language and the world, the universe is in increasing entropy. But I no longer know what it is if I climb to the top of a tree (one of these trees on the border between language and the world), from where you can see far into language and far into the world at the same time.    21. Because I have scaled a tree, I know that beyond language is a huge plain, with dark flowers and little mazy footpaths.
        




Echo
 

It would not sound so deepWere it a Firmamental Product--Airs no Oceans keep----Emily Dickinson
Afloat between your lens   
and your gaze,   
the last consideration to go   
across my gray matter   
and its salubrious   
deliquescence   
is   
whether or not I'll swim,   
whether I'll be able to breathe,   
whether I'll live like before.   

I'm caught in the bubble   
of your breath.   
It locks me in.   
Drives me mad.   

Confined to speak alone,   
I talk and listen,   
ask questions and answer myself.   
I hum, I think I sing,   
I breathe in, breathe in and don't explode.   
I'm no one.   

Behind the wall   
of hydrogen and oxygen,   
very clear, almost illuminated,   
you allow me to think   
that the Root of the Wind is Water 
and the atmosphere   
smells of salt and microbes and intimacy. 

And in that instant comes   
the low echo   
of a beyond beyond,   
a language archaic and soaked   
in syllables and accents suited   
for re-de-trans-forming,   
giving light,   
giving birth to   
melanin   
hidden within another skin:   
the hollow echo of the voice   
which speaks alone.   






Dracula
 

Protruding, rebelling against the lips,   
the long, pointed, ill-fated fang stared at me,   
(in spite of awkward attempts to hide it).   

Stealing adolescent glances,   
I dreamed it pierced me, pushing deep in the base of my neck.   
I bit my lower lip, flushed,   
but not before blushing under its spell.   

Yesterday,   
Yesterday when he smiled at me, with teeth in perfect alignment   
          (dentistry can work miracles),   
I turned my apostate face,   
and squinting, pretended to watch passersby.   







The Broken String
 

Nuing-kuiten my father's friend   
was a lion sorcerer   
and walked on feet of hair.   
People saw his spoor and said:   
"The sorcerer has visited us.   
He is the one who treads on hair.   
This big animal prowling   
was Nuing-kuiten.   

He used to travel by night-- 
he did not want to be seen   
for people might shoot at him   
and he might maul someone.   
At night he could go unseen,   
after other lion sorcerers   
who slink into our dwellings   
and drag out men.   

The sorcerer lived with us   
hunting in a lion's form   
until an ox fell prey to him.   
Then the Boers rode out   
and shot my father's friend,   
but he fought those people off   
and came home to tell father   
how Boers had wounded him.   

He thought father did not know   
he was wounded in his lion form.   
Soon he would have to go   
for he lay in extreme pain.   
If only he could take father   
and teach him his magic and songs,   
father would walk in his craft,   
sing his songs, and remember him. 
He died, and my father sang:   

"Men broke the string for me   
and made my dwelling like this.   
Men broke the string for me   
and now   
my dwelling is strange to me.   

My dwelling stands empty   
because the string has broken,   
and now   
my dwelling is a hardship for me.   






The north wind whips
 

The north wind whips through,   
in the streets papers and leaves   
are chased with resentment.   
Houses moan,   
dogs curl into balls.   
There is something in   
the afternoon's finger,   
a catfish spine,   
a rusty nail.   

Someone unthinkingly   
smoked cigarettes in heaven,   
left it overcast, listless.   
Here, at ground level, no one could   
take their shadow for a walk,   
sheltered in their houses, people   
are surprised to discover their misery.   

Someone didn't show,   
their host was insulted.   
Today the world   
agreed to open her thighs,   
suddenly the village comprehends   
that it is sometimes necessary to close their doors.   

Who can tell me   
why I meditate on this afternoon?   
Why is it birthed in me   
to knife the heart   
of whoever uncovered the mouth   
of the now whipping wind,   
to jam corncobs in the nose   
of the ghost that pants outside? 

The trees roar with laughter,   
they split their sides,   
they celebrate   
that you haven't arrived at your appointment.   

Now bring me   
the birds   
that you find in the trees,   
so I can tell them   
if the devil's eyelashes are curled.





The Chinese Mothers Lullaby
 

Pull in your feet, little darling,   
so I can kiss your wee trotters   
while I fold under a toe   
and another one underneath.   
I bend a little piggie.   
I bend another little piggie   
And look at that naughty little piggie   
that is still sticking out.   

Now, now, my treasure,   
there is work to be done here.   
Your toes like fairy thimbles,   
the blossom of the foxglove.   
Like a calf that is spancelled   
or a hobble on a chicken,   
there will be swaddlings of silk   
on the feet of my dear.   

That my daughter now shrieks   
like a blue jay is no matter,   
she will sway in the future   
like a bamboo on a windy day   
or like a willow sapling.   
So I bend under the big toe   
and another toe after   
to form a foot like a lotus   
about to unfold. 

Poor Cliodhna has flat feet.   
Maire has huge ones.   
Peggy's are like spades   
and Niamh's like two rakes.   
Just hold still, my dearie,   
while I tighten your bindings.   
I'm only your mammy   
doing my very best for your sake





from In Lovely Blue
 

Like the stamen inside a flower   
The steeple stands in lovely blue   
And the day unfolds around its needle;   

The flock of swallows that circles the steeple   
Flies there each day through the same blue air   
That carries their cries from me to you;   

We know how high the sun is now   
As long as the roof of the steeple glows,   
The roof that's covered with sheets of tin;   

Up there in the wind, where the wind is not   
Turning the vane of the weathercock,   
The weathercock silently crows in the wind.   





from The Seasons: Spring
 

   As rising from the vegetable World
My Theme ascends, with equal Wing ascend,
My panting Muse; and hark, how loud the Woods
Invite you forth in all your gayest Trim.
Lend me your Song, ye Nightingales! oh pour
The mazy-running Soul of Melody
Into my varied Verse! while I deduce,
From the first Note the hollow Cuckoo sings,
The Symphony of Spring, and touch a Theme
Unknown to Fame, the Passion of the Groves. 

   When first the Soul of Love is sent abroad,
Warm thro the vital Air, and on the Heart
Harmonious seizes, the gay Troops begin,
In gallant Thought, to plume the painted Wing;
And try again the long-forgotten Strain,
At first faint-warbled. But no sooner grows
The soft Infusion prevalent, and wide,
Than, all alive, at once their Joy o'erflows
In Musick unconfin'd. Up-springs the Lark,
Shrill-voic'd, and loud, the Messenger of Morn;
Ere yet the Shadows fly, he mounted sings
Amid the dawning Clouds, and from their Haunts
Calls up the tuneful Nations. Every Copse
Deep-tangled, Tree irregular, and Bush
Bending with dewy Moisture, o'er the Heads
Of the coy Quiristers that lodge within,
Are prodigal of harmony. The Thrush
And Wood-lark, o'er the kind contending Throng
Superior heard, run thro' the sweetest Length
Of Notes; when listening Philomela deigns
To let them joy, and purposes, in Thought
Elate, to make her Night excel their Day.
The Black-bird whistles from the thorny Brake;
The mellow Bullfinch answers from the Grove:
Nor are the Linnets, o'er the flow'ring Furze
Pour'd out profusely, silent. Join'd to these
Innumerous Songsters, in the freshening Shade
Of new-sprung Leaves, their Modulations mix
Mellifluous. The Jay, the Rook, the Daw,
And each harsh Pipe discordant heard alone,
Aid the full Concert: while the Stock-dove breathes
A melancholy Murmur thro' the whole.

   'Tis Love creates their Melody, and all
This Waste of Music is the Voice of Love;
That even to Birds, and Beasts, the tender Arts
Of pleasing teaches. Hence the glossy kind
Try every winning way inventive Love
Can dictate, and in Courtship to their Mates
Pour forth their little Souls. First, wide around,
With distant Awe, in airy Rings they rove,
Endeavouring by a thousand Tricks to catch
The cunning, conscious, half-averted Glance
Of their regardless Charmer. Should she seem
Softening the least Approvance to bestow,
Their Colours burnish, and by Hope inspir'd,
They brisk advance; then, on a sudden struck,
Retire disorder'd; then again approach;
In fond rotation spread the spotted Wing,
And shiver every Feather with Desire.

   Connubial Leagues agreed, to the deep Woods
They haste away, all as their Fancy leads,
Pleasure, or Food, or secret Safety prompts;
That Nature's great Command may be obey'd,
Nor all the sweet Sensations they perceive
Indulg'd in vain. Some to the Holly-Hedge
Nestling repair, and to the Thicket some;
Some to the rude Protection of the Thorn
Commit their feeble Offspring. The cleft Tree
Offers its kind Concealment to a Few,
Their Food its Insects, and its Moss their Nests.
Others apart far in the grassy Dale,
Or roughening Waste, their humble Texture weave.
But most in woodland Solitudes delight,
In unfrequented Glooms, or shaggy Banks,
Steep, and divided by a babbling Brook,
Whose Murmurs soothe them all the live-long Day,
When by kind Duty fix'd. Among the Roots
Of Hazel, pendant o'er the plaintive Stream,
They frame the first Foundation of their Domes;
Dry Sprigs of Trees, in artful Fabrick laid,
And bound with Clay together. Now 'tis nought
But restless Hurry thro the busy Air,
Beat by unnumer'd Wings. The Swallow sweeps
The slimy Pool, to build his hanging House
Intent. And often, from the careless Back
Of Herds and Flocks, a thousand tugging Bills
Pluck Hair and Wool; and oft, when unobserv'd,
Steal from the Barn a Straw: till soft and warm,
Clean, and compleat, their Habitation grows.

   As thus the patient Dam assiduous sits,
Not to be tempted from her tender Task,
Or by sharp Hunger, or by smooth Delight,
Tho the whole loosen'd Spring around Her blows,
Her sympathizing Lover takes his Stand
High on th' opponent Bank, and ceaseless sings
The tedious Time away; or else supplies
Her place a moment, while she sudden flits
To pick the scanty Meal. Th' appointed Time
With pious Toil fulfill'd, the callow Young,
Warm'd and expanded into perfect Life,
Their brittle Bondage break, and come to Light,
A helpless Family, demanding Food
With constant Clamour. O what Passions then,
What melting Sentiments of kindly Care,
On the new Parents seize! Away they fly
Affectionate, and undesiring bear
The most delicious Morsel to their Young,
Which equally distributed, again
The Search begins. Even so a gentle Pair,
By Fortune sunk, but form'd of generous Mold,
And charm'd with Cares beyond the vulgar Breast,
In some lone Cott amid the distant Woods,
Sustain'd alone by providential Heaven,
Oft, as they weeping eye their infant Train,
Check their own Appetites and give them all.

   Nor Toil alone they scorn: exalting Love,
By the great Father of the Spring inspir'd,
Gives instant Courage to the fearful Race,
And to the simple Art. With stealthy Wing,
Should some rude Foot their woody Haunts molest,
Amid a neighbouring Bush they silent drop,
And whirring thence, as if alarm'd, deceive
Th' unfeeling School-Boy. Hence, around the Head
Of wandering Swain, the white-wing'd Plover wheels
Her sounding Flight, and then directly on
In long Excursion skims the level Lawn,
To tempt him from her Nest. The Wild-Duck, hence,
O'er the rough Moss, and o'er the trackless Waste
The Heath-Hen flutters, (pious Fraud!) to lead
The hot pursuing Spaniel far astray.

   Be not the Muse asham'd, here to bemoan
Her Brothers of the Grove, by tyrant Man
Inhuman caught, and in the narrow Cage
From Liberty confin'd, and boundless Air.
Dull are the pretty Slaves, their Plumage dull,
Ragged, and all its brightening Lustre lost;
Nor is that sprightly Wildness in their Notes,
Which, clear and vigorous, warbles from the Beech.
Oh then, ye Friends of Love and Love-taught Song,
Spare the soft Tribes, this barbarous Art forbear!
If on your Bosom Innocence can win,
Music engage, or Piety persuade.

   But let not chief the Nightingale lament
Her ruin'd Care, too delicately fram'd
To brook the harsh Confinement of the Cage.
Oft when, returning with her loaded Bill,
Th' astonish'd Mother finds a vacant Nest,
By the hard Hand of unrelenting Clowns
Robb'd, to the Ground the vain Provision falls;
Her Pinions ruffle, and low-drooping scarce
Can bear the Mourner to the poplar Shade;
Where, all abandon'd to Despair, she sings
Her Sorrows thro the Night; and, on the Bough,
Sole-sitting, still at every dying Fall
Takes up again her lamentable Strain
Of winding Woe; till wide around the Woods
Sigh to her Song, and with her Wail resound.

   But now the feather'd Youth their former Bounds,
Ardent, disdain; and, weighing oft their Wings,
Demand the free Possession of the Sky.
This one glad Office more, and then dissolves
Parental Love at once, now needless grown.
Unlavish Wisdom never works in vain.
'Tis on some Evening, sunny, grateful, mild,
When nought but Balm is breathing thro the Woods,
With yellow Lustre bright, that the new Tribes
Visit the spacious Heavens, and look abroad
On Nature's Common, far as they can see,
Or wing, their Range, and Pasture. O'er the Boughs
Dancing about, still at the giddy Verge
Their Resolution fails; their Pinions till,
In loose Libration stretch'd, to trust the Void
Trembling refuse: till down before them fly
The Parent-Guides, and chide, exhort, command,
Or push them off. The surging Air receives
The Plumy Burden; and their self-taught Wings
Winnow the waving Element. On Ground
Alighted, bolder up again they lead,
Farther and farther on, the lengthening Flight;
Till vanish'd every Fear, and every Power
Rouz'd into Life and Action, light in Air
Th' acquitted Parents see their soaring Race,
And once rejoicing never know them more.

Insanity
 

The quick-sliding cape of mind 
Drags wrinkled on a dusty floor, 
A party dress, 
Sagging from those shoulders 
      of a smile 
      that stalks through crooked time 
             followed by a goat 
             nipping the petticoat. 
Scape-goat, grin out loud. 
Make the cloak a shroud. 
      He whinnys through the nose, 
             paws the trailing hem 
             and strikes a fawning pose. 

Tight-clamped, the clasp of tin 
Tears cloth it won't undo. 
Before the gown slips down. 
A rent . . . which lets the darkness through.





On the Crash of an Airliner at Takeoff
 

When bodies broken and all bodies seared 
Are counted up, uncrusted, tagged as feared, 
We know next day the scene will stand alone 
On pages white and mindless of the bone. 
Shall notice recognize beyond the burned, 
Or caption past the people tritely charred, 
Related dusty partness with the term 
Antiquity, the sense of death in stone 
And knowledge of the previously marred? 


On battlefields of Troy or Tuscany 
Or other places where techniques engaged, 
When warrior fell, or blade or boy enraged, 
Of them did campfire journalists of song 
Forget collective going, all but pathos, 
In wretchedness and fact of having gone? 
Accuse the gnostic grammar of old wars: 
It maims our grasp of accidental death 
Past putting down of papers to decry 
Their overlooking what it means to die.





Warning from a Visitor in the Control Tower
 

To airmen crossing and communicant 
With orders of this field, no landing here 
But by the grace of God; no postulant 
Piloting earthward should abuse his fear: 
Trust in the instruments which fall their round, 
Tonight the only ceiling is the ground; 
Zero, from nothing into nothing made, 
Signifies all of altitude that stayed. 


Notice the fog that makes me all but blind; 
Here in the tower my skeleton will do 
To signal you. I am for all your kind 
Tonight's full complement and only crew. 
Airmen, I hope you read loud and clear; 
Your radios sound happy and sincere: 
Roger, you say, and dive for wreaths of holly 
Thinking the next voice heard will be as jolly. 


Suggest you take along the death's-head flag 
And hope that waving it will set you free. 
Judgment, like flights, may be a game of tag 
And you can shake and plead the Varsity. 
Say that team spirit was your only motive: 
You shot them up and did a locomotive. 
What if there is a temporary fetter? 
Christ understands. He also got his letter. 


I have you, heroes, holding each your course: 
You shot them up a little, and you grope 
Tonight with neither memory nor remorse; 
My skull is watching in the radarscope. 
I marvel as I track your sure downfall 
How you can navigate or fly at all 
For thinking of the tallies without log 
Until you make an error in this fog.





Defense Mechanism
 

This is about heroes, and you should know 
I do not mean old men with membranous snow 
Already patching them on hand and cheek; 
I mean the medaled models from the Greek 
On whom the air force lavishes technique 
Like tennis lessons and engineering toys 
Given at schools for preparatory boys. 

Say what you will, this flyer on his base 
Who attends airdromes is the immortal ace 
Training to come out of some urgent East 
Greater astride his apocalyptic beast 
Than any movie star: the new high priest. 
To glimpse him people will abandon cover 
And in his thunder die as for a lover. 

Pious and helmeted he lives these nones 
Attentive to the voices in his phones 
And calculating when will be the ides 
Through his impatience with the time he bides 
In long equations as the slide rule slides; 
There is no telling the ominous from calm 
In practice runs to drop a perfect bomb. 

Nourished and celibate, tanned, tall, erect 
As he navigates and crosshairs intersect, 
He dreams a lissome girl and highschool kiss: 
Physicians have no thought of mending this; 
The natural death is one he may not miss: 
Whoever said time steals without a sound? 
It makes a noise of bandage being wound. 

Little by little grows the good machine 
Preening equipment as pterodactyls preen; 
And when the night pins down the firmament 
He goes aloft to fly by instrument 
Limning the stars on graphs where light is bent: 
To fly in squadron and to walk in squad, 
This is the double-natured demigod.





Butter
 

My mother loves butter more than I do, 
more than anyone. She pulls chunks off 
the stick and eats it plain, explaining 
cream spun around into butter! Growing up 
we ate turkey cutlets sauteed in lemon 
and butter, butter and cheese on green noodles, 
butter melting in small pools in the hearts 
of Yorkshire puddings, butter better 
than gravy staining white rice yellow, 
butter glazing corn in slipping squares, 
butter the lava in white volcanoes 
of hominy grits, butter softening 
in a white bowl to be creamed with white 
sugar, butter disappearing into 
whipped sweet potatoes, with pineapple, 
butter melted and curdy to pour 
over pancakes, butter licked off the plate 
with warm Alaga syrup. When I picture 
the good old days I am grinning greasy 
with my brother, having watched the tiger 
chase his tail and turn to butter. We are 
Mumbo and Jumbo's children despite   
historical revision, despite 
our parent's efforts, glowing from the inside 
out, one hundred megawatts of butter.





Minnesota Fats Describes His Youth
 

I've been eating 
like a sultan 
since I was two days old. 

I had a mother 
and three sisters 
who worshipped me. 

When I was two years old 
they used to plop me 
in a bed with a jillion 

satin pillows 
and spray me   
with exotic perfumes 

and lilac water, 
and then 
they would shoot me the grapes.





La Ghriba ("The Stranger) Tells How and Why
 

The people who live here 
do two things: their faces whiten past you or blacken into 
you. Girls are not supposed to come to islands 
by themselves; did no one tell you? You found 

the highest hill, away from their whistles, 
their eyes. Up here only windy grass, the blow of sea that brought you. 
Only a few cigarette butts, pistachio shells. They come here, 
but hardly. The house you make 

is sticks and burrs. Dirt on white knuckles. The sea 
through the cracks. They do not talk to you anymore, or look at you, 
your first wish. The wind and sea are full of stomachs: 
now, learn to disappear 

into them. Your house's slender frame catches 
fire one day. You hear them buzzing below. They watch, 
they stand, wild brightness from the hill reflecting 
in each eye. Light. Birds almost green among 

the sparks. Is it the sun? No, the moon 
has caught the sun in its mouth. The moon is nothing but the sun letting 
it see itself. The question comes again, do you have too much faith 
in people, or too little? Like when you were sitting on the ledge by the sea 

and three large boys' shadows stubbed the grass. 
Your first thought was, so they will make me fall. But they don't 
make you fall. Whether they are afraid of you or you of them, whether 
they are jeering, is not clear. 

This is the island with the hill with the house with the girl with the fire 
inside. Afterwards they climb to the top to look at something ruined 
close-up. They touch the door, soft with ash: 

the body, amongst the branches and birds, 
is white. The face catches the sun's   
light.





Many Scientists Convert to Islam
 

Conversations with a Muslim friend
1 

So, if you don't believe in full it means you don't 
believe. Words tumble onto the rock. A book 
happens. 

Okay then tell me about heaven's beautiful 
food and women. Who are these women? 

My friend says, "This life is like a twenty-minute train ride. 
He says, "I live inside my 
faith more fully every day. 

I am standing on soaked pavement outside 
that majestic hotel in the center of town. Just before 
dark, the birds come in a furious swoop like 
hornets, stinging the sky to let in 

what is on the other side. 


         2 

Then the next life is equally 
about the body, denied in the first? 

"Do you know the Prophet knew the exact number of bones in the human 
body? And why do you ask so many questions? You ask 
more questions than you take in breaths of air. 

The birds beat. They crumple in 
rivers of sky. At the same time every day. Kierkegaard said that 

every instant a man in despair is contracting it. My friend is not 
in despair; I am not in despair. 


         3 

Kierkegaard says there are three kinds of despair: despair 
at not being conscious of having a self, despair at not being 
willing to be oneself, and despair at willingness to be 

oneself. Listen, the train. Why complain about 
the seat, the air conditioner? Just do 
your best until you arrive. 

During Ramadan, I fasted a week. I went to the mosque. 

My friend's uncle said: 
"So you are becoming Muslim? I said: "No. He said: "Shame 
on you. 

In the cold November current, there is a whirring of wings. Sometimes 
they cloud into petals, sometimes they don't. 


         4 

When the forehead presses to the earth, the blood moves 
down. In the joining, the self lightens. You must count the three perfect 
joints of each finger to keep time. Make no mistake, you leave the body only 

through the body. The train ride. This quiet voice that is borrowed or my own.





Us and Them
 

"I would make love to one of our 

whores before I 
would fuck one of their 
bourgeoisie. There was a proverb, 

like this: Don't trust a         if 
he becomes a         even though 
he remains a       for 

forty years. And the sister opposite 
proverb: Don't trust a       even 
though he has been in the grave 

for forty years. It was a difficult day, 
a bomb had spun open 
a bus, and children 

had been crushed down by 
a machine. Each wondered if he was born 
too soon, if later would have been better, if 40

From Her Notes
 

My last Sabbath, 
I follow the girls, who sneak into 
the wedding 

tent, scattered with sun 
flower seeds and remnants of 
celebration. They 

each stand up on a   
table. Take a crushed beer can 
as a microphone, 

sing and move their 
fifteen-year-old hips. I watch, 
clap for them, until 

a small face peers in 
the door. A boy. His face white 
with something. The door 

slamming, his very small 
fist holding it shut, having 
found what was inside 

wrong. Enough, I tell 
him; enough! He leaves. The girls 
dance again, but less 

bold. Look: the boy 
has come back, is looking you 
hard in the eye, through 

the crack of the door. 
There, in his hand, a neon 
plastic BB 

gun. He does this for 
his grandmother and for his 
son.





Cartoon Physics, part 1
 

Children under, say, ten, shouldn't know 
that the universe is ever-expanding,   
inexorably pushing into the vacuum, galaxies 

swallowed by galaxies, whole 

solar systems collapsing, all of it 
acted out in silence. At ten we are still learning 

the rules of cartoon animation, 

that if a man draws a door on a rock 
only he can pass through it.   
Anyone else who tries 

will crash into the rock. Ten-year-olds 
should stick with burning houses, car wrecks,   
ships going down--earthbound, tangible 

disasters, arenas 

where they can be heroes. You can run 
back into a burning house, sinking ships 

have lifeboats, the trucks will come 
with their ladders, if you jump 

you will be saved. A child 

places her hand on the roof of a schoolbus,   
& drives across a city of sand. She knows 

the exact spot it will skid, at which point 
the bridge will give, who will swim to safety 
& who will be pulled under by sharks. She will learn 

that if a man runs off the edge of a cliff 
he will not fall 

until he notices his mistake.





Song
 

You shout my name
from beyond my dreams, 
beyond the picture window
of this Rosarito beach house. 
Rushing from bed to shore
I glimpse their backs--
volcanoes rising out of the sea.
Your back, a blue-black silhouette,
feet wet with the wash of morning waves.
Fountains spring from mammal minds, 
my hands lifting a splash of sand. 
I'm on my knees, 
toes finding a cool prayer
beneath them, fingers pressing
sea foam to my temples, 
while you open arms wide as a generation, 
raise them to a compass point, 
dive.
If you could reach them, 
you would ride their fins
under the horizon, 
then surf the crash of waves 
left in their wake. 
And if I could grasp
my own fear, 
I'd drown it, 
leave it breathless and blue
as this ocean, 
as the brilliant backs
of whales
surfacing 
for air.





Grand Central, Track 23
 

I forgot to tell you it's almost time to go.
The sun has distilled its particular worn essence 
And the glittering trout is flipped on the bow.   

A man asks me what time it is. I don't know.   
I have emptied my purse and wept in the presence   
Of onlookers. I forgot to remember to go 

Before eleven, when the steely arrow 
Shot swimming to its underneath, tense 
As a stream of salmon in reverse below 

The laureled, relentless clocks. The sceptered row 
Of columns dreams one o'clock, immense,   
Inviolate. What time is it? I don't know.   

This story concerns the night I tried to go-- 
Though many times I flopped into the silence 
Of orange plastic seating like onto the bow 

Of a lonely ship, and felt my breathing slow. 
The frail, retreating stand of columns prevents 
The clocks from telling me time and time again to go.   
At my feet, a glittering trout swims past the bow.





Bowl
 

Turn it over and look up 
into the sphere of heaven.   
The tracery is lucent,   
light seeping through to write,   
white-ink your face, upturned.   

Swing it below 
and it's a cradle of blue water,   
the sea, a womb. 
A mixing bowl   
for Babylonian gods. 
Here, they whirl up the cosmos.   

Pick it up and your hands 
form a pedestal, 
and all who drink 
contain the arcs 
of body and the universe-- 
and between them,   

no imaginable tear or distance.





The Search for Lost Lives
 

I was chasing this blue butterfly down
the road when a car came by and clipped me.   
It was nothing serious, but it angered me and 
I turned around and cursed the driver who didn't 
even slow down to see if I was hurt. Then I 
returned my attention to the butterfly which   
was nowhere to be seen. One of the Doubleday   
girls came running up the street with her toy 
poodle toward me. I stopped her and asked, 
"Have you seen a blue butterfly around here?" 
"It's down near that birch tree near Grandpa's," 
she said. "Thanks," I said, and walked briskly 
toward the tree. It was fluttering from flower 
to flower in Mr. Doubleday's extensive garden,   
a celestial blueness to soothe the weary heart.   
I didn't know what I was doing there. I certain- 
ly didn't want to capture it. It was like 
something I had known in another life, even if 
it was only in a dream, I wanted to confirm it.   
I was a blind beggar on the streets of Cordoba 
when I first saw it, and now, again it was here.





Hedgehog
 

The snail moves like a 
Hovercraft, held up by a
Rubber cushion of itself, 
Sharing its secret

With the hedgehog. The hedgehog
Shares its secret with no one. 
We say, Hedgehog, come out
Of yourself and we will love you. 

We mean no harm. We want
Only to listen to what
You have to say. We want
Your answers to our questions.

The hedgehog gives nothing
Away, keeping itself to itself.
We wonder what a hedgehog
Has to hide, why it so distrusts.

We forget the god
under this crown of thorns. 
We forget that never again
will a god trust in the world.





Pity
 

Christ bore what suffering he could and died   
a young man, but you waited years to learn   
how to heal.   Only when you could did you   
touch the man whose body blistered for yours.   

You posted him no news for sixteen terms,   
then just a signed graduation notice.   

The letter he wrote that week asked only,   
Now that your books are closed, can boys come in?   

At your wedding, you buried the woman   
you thought you knew inside a stranger's name.   

This is how you found yourself: thirty-three,   
nursing a son. Soon there was another.   
Your mind had already begun to walk.   
But you were a mother.   Those cribs held you.





First Fire
 

Stripped in a flamedance, the bluff backing our houses   
quivered in wet-black skin.   A shawl of haze tugged tight   
around the starkness. We could have choked on August.   

Smoke thick in our throats, nearly naked as the earth,   
we played bare feet over the heat caught in asphalt.   
Could we, green girls, have prepared for this?   Yesterday,   

we played in sand-carpeted caves.   The store we built   
sold broken bits of ice plant, empty snail shells, leaves.   
Our school's walls were open sky.   We reeled in wonder   

from the hills, oblivious to the beckoning   
crescendo and to our parent's hushed communion.   
When our bluff swayed into the undulation, we ran   

into the still streets of our suburb, feet burning   
against a fury that we did not know was change.





Requiem
 

Sing the mass--  light upon me washing words  now that I am gone.
The sky was a hot, blue sheet the summer breeze fanned   
out and over the town.   I could have lived forever   
under that sky.   Forgetting where I was,   
I looked left, not right, crossed into a street   
and stepped in front of the bus that ended me.   

Will you believe me when I tell you it was beautiful--   
my left leg turned to uselessness and my right shoe flung   
some distance down the road?   Will you believe me   
when I tell you I had never been so in love   
with anyone as I was, then, with everyone I saw?   

The way an age-worn man held his wife's shaking arm,   
supporting the weight that seemed to sing from the heart   
she clutched.   Knowing her eyes embraced the pile   
that was me, he guided her sacked body through the crowd.   
And the way one woman began a fast the moment she looked   

under the wheel.   I saw her swear off decadence.   
I saw her start to pray.   You see, I was so beautiful   
the woman sent to clean the street used words   
like police tape to keep back a young boy   
seconds before he rounded the grisly bumper.   

The woman who cordoned the area feared my memory   
would fly him through the world on pinions of passion   
much as, later, the sight of my awful beauty pulled her down   
to tears when she pooled my blood with water   
and swiftly, swiftly washed my stains away.





We were Two Rooms of One Timber, But I Left that Place Alone
 

Sara, widow, 31
Henry pulled our heartwood along the rutted street   
that town stood beside, built two rooms   
and called them home.   My Henry did that.   
There.   And I lived all those days inside his love.   

But there is a kind of hunger that feeds   
on flesh.   Only, let it be yearning, heaving,   
rising flesh.   Only, let it be flesh living   
and loving.   Alive.   Let it be life.   

There is a kind of hunger that feeds on life.   
They carved into him with banquet knives,   
made stew of his skin and stirred it   
with his own bones.   My Henry served: the meat   
and the pot to cook it in.   And there was no charge   
against the men who made that meal.





Ark
 

I will enter you as hope enters me,   
through blinding liquid, light of rain, and I   
will stay inside until you send me out;   
I will stay inside until you ground me.   
We cannot outrun the rain.   So many   
summers I have tried.   So many summers.   
But when the rumble calls after the spark   
there can be no escape.   No outstripping   
the drench soak, the wet sheath, the water caul.   
This is more than you want to hear.   Much more   
than I want to tell you.   Tabernacle   
transporting my life from the desert, you,   
the faith I am born and reborn into,   
you, rescuer, deliverer of rain.





What to Eat, What to Drink, and What to Leave for Poison
 

I.   
Only now, in spring, can the place be named:   
tulip poplar, daffodil, crab apple,   
dogwood, budding pink-green, white-green, yellow   
on my knowing.   All winter I was lost.   
Fall, I found myself here, with no texture   
my fingers know.   Then, worse, the white longing   
that downed us deep three months.   No flower heat.   
That was winter.   But now, in spring, the buds   
flock our trees.   Ten million exquisite buds,   
tiny and loud, flaring their petalled wings,   
bellowing from ashen branches vibrant   
keys, the chords of spring's triumph: fisted heart,   
dogwood; grail, poplar; wine spray, crab apple.   
The song is drink, is color.   Come.   Now.   Taste. 

II.   
The song is drink, is color.   Come now, taste   
what the world has to offer.   When you eat   
you will know that music comes in guises--   
bold of crepe myrtle, sweet of daffodil--   
beyond sound, guises they never told you   
could be true.   And they aren't.   Except they are   
so real now, this spring, you know them, taste them.   
Green as kale, the songs of spring, bright as wine,   
the music.   Faces of this season grin   
with clobbering wantonness--see the smiles   
open on each branch?--until you, too, smile.   
Wide carnival of color, carnival   
of scent.   We're all lurching down streets, drunk now   
from the poplar's grail.   Wine spray: crab apple. 

III.   
From the poplar's grail, wine spray.   Crab apple   
brightens jealously to compete.   But by   
the crab apple's deep stain, the tulip tree   
learns modesty.   Only blush, poplar learns,   
lightly.   Never burn such a dark-hued fire   
to the core.   Tulip poplar wants herself   
light under leaf, never, like crab apple,   
heavy under tart fruit.   Never laden.   
So the poplar pours just a hint of wine   
in her cup, while the crab apple, wild one,   
acts as if her body were a fountain.   
She would pour wine onto you, just let her.   
Shameless, she plants herself, and delivers,   
down anyone's street, bright invitations. 

IV.   
Down anyone's street-bright invitations.   
Suck em.   Swallow em.   Eat them whole.   That's right,   
be greedy about it.   The brightness calls   
and you follow because you want to taste,   
because you want to be welcomed inside   
the code of that color: red for thirst; green   
for hunger; pink, a kiss; and white, stain me   
now.   Soil me with touching.   Is that right?   
No?   That's not, you say, what you meant.   Not what   
you meant at all?   Pardon.   Excuse me, please.   
Your hand was reaching, tugging at this shirt   
of flowers and I thought, I guess I thought   
you were hungry for something beautiful.   
Come now.   The brightness here might fill you up. 

V.   
Come.   Now the brightness here might fill you up,   
but tomorrow?   Who can know what the next   
day will bring.   It is like that, here, in spring.   
Four days ago, the dogwood was a fist   
in protest.   Now look.   Even she unfurls   
to the pleasure of the season.   Don't be   
ashamed of yourself.   Don't be.    This happens   
to us all.   We have thrown back the blanket.   
We're naked and we've grown to love ourselves.   
I tell you, do not be ashamed.   Who is   
more wanton than the dancing crepe myrtle?   
Is she ashamed?   Why, even the dogwood,   
that righteous tree of God's, is full of lust   
exploding into brightness every spring. 

VI.   
Exploding into brightness every spring,   
I draw you close.   I wonder, do you know   
how long I've wanted to be here?   Each year   
you grasp me, lift me, carry me inside.   
Glee is the body of the daffodil   
reaching tubed fingers through the day, feeling   
her own trumpeted passion choiring air   
with hot, colored song.   This is a texture   
I love.   This is life.   And, too, you love me,   
inhale my whole being every spring.   Gone   
winter, heavy clod whose icy body   
fell into my bed.   I must leave you, but   
I'll wait through heat, fall, freeze to hear you cry:   
Daffodils are up.   My God, what beauty! 

VII.   
Daffodils are up, my God!   What beauty   
concerted down on us last night.   And if   
I sleep again, I'll wake to a louder   
blossoming, the symphony smashing down   
hothouse walls, and into the world: music.   
Something like the birds' return, each morning's   
crescendo rising toward its brightest pitch,   
colors unfurling, petals alluring.   
The song, the color, the rising ecstasy   
of spring.   My God.   This beauty.   This, this   
is what I've hoped for.   All my life is here   
in the unnamed core--dogwood, daffodil,   
tulip poplar, crab apple, crepe myrtle--   
only now, in spring, can the place be named.

The Corn-Stalk Fiddle
 

When the corn's all cut and the bright stalks shine 
   Like the burnished spears of a field of gold; 
When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine, 
   And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold; 
Then its heigho fellows and hi-diddle-diddle, 
For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle. 

And you take a stalk that is straight and long, 
   With an expert eye to its worthy points, 
And you think of the bubbling strains of song 
   That are bound between its pithy joints-- 
Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle, 
With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle. 

Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow 
   O'er the yielding strings with a practiced hand! 
And the music's flow never loud but low 
   Is the concert note of a fairy band. 
Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle 
To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle. 

When the eve comes on and our work is done 
   And the sun drops down with a tender glance, 
With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun, 
   Come the neighbor girls for the evening's dance, 
And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle, 
More time than tune--from the corn-stalk fiddle. 

Then brother Jabez takes the bow, 
   While Ned stands off with Susan Bland, 
Then Henry stops by Milly Snow 
   And John takes Nellie Jones's hand, 
While I pair off with Mandy Biddle, 
And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle. 

"Salute your partners, comes the call, 
   "All join hands and circle round, 
"Grand train back, and "Balance all, 
   Footsteps lightly spurn the ground, 
"Take your lady and balance down the middle 
To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle. 

So the night goes on and the dance is o'er, 
   And the merry girls are homeward gone,   
But I see it all in my sleep once more, 
   And I dream till the very break of dawn 
Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle 
To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle. 







The Paradox
 

I am the mother of sorrows, 
   I am the ender of grief; 
I am the bud and the blossom, 
   I am the late-falling leaf. 

I am thy priest and thy poet, 
   I am thy serf and thy king; 
I cure the tears of the heartsick, 
   When I come near they shall sing. 

White are my hands as the snowdrop; 
   Swart are my fingers as clay; 
Dark is my frown as the midnight, 
   Fair is my brow as the day. 

Battle and war are my minions, 
   Doing my will as divine; 
I am the calmer of passions, 
   Peace is a nursling of mine. 

Speak to me gently or curse me, 
   Seek me or fly from my sight; 
I am thy fool in the morning, 
   Thou art my slave in the night. 

Down to the grave will I take thee, 
   Out from the noise of the strife; 
Then shalt thou see me and know me-- 
   Death, then, no longer, but life. 

Then shalt thou sing at my coming, 
   Kiss me with passionate breath, 
Clasp me and smile to have thought me 
   Aught save the foeman of Death. 

Come to me, brother, when weary, 
   Come when thy lonely heart swells; 
I'll guide thy footsteps and lead thee 
   Down where the Dream Woman dwells.





Eliza Harris
 

Like a fawn from the arrow, startled and wild, 
A woman swept by us, bearing a child; 
In her eye was the night of a settled despair, 
And her brow was o'ershaded with anguish and care. 

She was nearing the river--in reaching the brink, 
She heeded no danger, she paused not to think! 
For she is a mother--her child is a slave-- 
And she'll give him his freedom, or find him a grave! 

'Twas a vision to haunt us, that innocent face-- 
So pale in its aspect, so fair in its grace; 
As the tramp of the horse and the bay of the hound, 
With the fetters that gall, were trailing the ground! 

She was nerved by despair, and strengthen'd by woe, 
As she leap'd o'er the chasms that yawn'd from below; 
Death howl'd in the tempest, and rav'd in the blast, 
But she heard not the sound till the danger was past. 

Oh! how shall I speak of my proud country's shame? 
Of the stains on her glory, how give them their name? 
How say that her banner in mockery waves-- 
Her "star-spangled banner--o'er millions of slaves? 

How say that the lawless may torture and chase 
A woman whose crime is the hue of her face? 
How the depths of forest may echo around 
With the shrieks of despair, and the bay of the hound? 

With her step on the ice, and her arm on her child, 
The danger was fearful, the pathway was wild; 
But, aided by Heaven, she gained a free shore, 
Where the friends of humanity open'd their door. 

So fragile and lovely, so fearfully pale, 
Like a lily that bends to the breath of the gale, 
Save the heave of her breast, and the sway of her hair, 
You'd have thought her a statue of fear and despair. 

In agony close to her bosom she press'd 
The life of her heart, the child of her breast:-- 
Oh! love from its tenderness gathering might, 
Had strengthen'd her soul for the dangers of flight. 

But she's free!--yes, free from the land where the slave 
From the hand of oppression must rest in the grave; 
Where bondage and torture, where scourges and chains 
Have plac'd on our banner indelible stains. 

The bloodhounds have miss'd the scent of her way; 
The hunter is rifled and foil'd of his prey; 
Fierce jargon and cursing, with clanking of chains, 
Make sounds of strange discord on Liberty's plains. 

With the rapture of love and fullness of bliss, 
She plac'd on his brow a mother's fond kiss:-- 
Oh! poverty, danger and death she can brave, 
For the child of her love is no longer a slave! 







Learning to Read
 

Very soon the Yankee teachers 
   Came down and set up school; 
But, oh! how the Rebs did hate it,-- 
   It was agin' their rule. 

Our masters always tried to hide 
   Book learning from our eyes; 
Knowledge did'nt agree with slavery-- 
   'Twould make us all too wise. 

But some of us would try to steal 
   A little from the book. 
And put the words together, 
   And learn by hook or crook. 

I remember Uncle Caldwell, 
   Who took pot liquor fat 
And greased the pages of his book, 
   And hid it in his hat. 

And had his master ever seen 
   The leaves upon his head, 
He'd have thought them greasy papers, 
   But nothing to be read. 

And there was Mr. Turner's Ben, 
   Who heard the children spell, 
And picked the words right up by heart, 
   And learned to read 'em well. 

Well, the Northern folks kept sending 
   The Yankee teachers down; 
And they stood right up and helped us, 
   Though Rebs did sneer and frown. 

And I longed to read my Bible, 
   For precious words it said; 
But when I begun to learn it, 
   Folks just shook their heads, 

And said there is no use trying, 
   Oh! Chloe, you're too late; 
But as I was rising sixty, 
   I had no time to wait. 

So I got a pair of glasses, 
   And straight to work I went, 
And never stopped till I could read 
   The hymns and Testament. 

Then I got a little cabin 
   A place to call my own-- 
And I felt independent 
   As the queen upon her throne. 







A Double Standard
 

Do you blame me that I loved him?
   If when standing all alone
I cried for bread a careless world
   Pressed to my lips a stone.

Do you blame me that I loved him,
   That my heart beat glad and free,
When he told me in the sweetest tones
   He loved but only me?

Can you blame me that I did not see
   Beneath his burning kiss
The serpent's wiles, nor even hear
   The deadly adder hiss?

Can you blame me that my heart grew cold
   That the tempted, tempter turned;
When he was feted and caressed
   And I was coldly spurned?

Would you blame him, when you draw from me
   Your dainty robes aside,
If he with gilded baits should claim
   Your fairest as his bride?

Would you blame the world if it should press
   On him a civic crown;
And see me struggling in the depth
   Then harshly press me down?

Crime has no sex and yet to-day
   I wear the brand of shame;
Whilst he amid the gay and proud
   Still bears an honored name.

Can you blame me if I've learned to think
   Your hate of vice a sham,
When you so coldly crushed me down
   And then excused the man?

Would you blame me if to-morrow
   The coroner should say,
A wretched girl, outcast, forlorn,
   Has thrown her life away?

Yes, blame me for my downward course,
   But oh! remember well,
Within your homes you press the hand
   That led me down to hell.

I'm glad God's ways are not our ways,
   He does not see as man,
Within His love I know there's room
   For those whom others ban.

I think before His great white throne,
   His throne of spotless light,
That whited sepulchres shall wear
   The hue of endless night.

That I who fell, and he who sinned,
   Shall reap as we have sown;
That each the burden of his loss
   Must bear and bear alone.

No golden weights can turn the scale
   Of justice in His sight;
And what is wrong in woman's life
   In man's cannot be right.







On Summer
 

Esteville begins to burn; 
   The auburn fields of harvest rise; 
The torrid flames again return, 
   And thunders roll along the skies. 

Perspiring Cancer lifts his head, 
   And roars terrific from on high; 
Whose voice the timid creatures dread; 
   From which they strive with awe to fly. 

The night-hawk ventures from his cell, 
   And starts his note in evening air; 
He feels the heat his bosom swell, 
   Which drives away the gloom of fear. 

Thou noisy insect, start thy drum; 
   Rise lamp-like bugs to light the train; 
And bid sweet Philomela come, 
   And sound in front the nightly strain. 

The bee begins her ceaseless hum, 
   And doth with sweet exertions rise; 
And with delight she stores her comb, 
   And well her rising stock supplies. 

Let sportive children well beware, 
   While sprightly frisking o'er the green; 
And carefully avoid the snare, 
   Which lurks beneath the smiling scene. 

The mistress bird assumes her nest, 
   And broods in silence on the tree, 
Her note to cease, her wings at rest, 
   She patient waits her young to see. 







George Moses Horton, Myself
 

I feel myself in need
   Of the inspiring strains of ancient lore,
My heart to lift, my empty mind to feed,
   And all the world explore.

I know that I am old
   And never can recover what is past,
But for the future may some light unfold
   And soar from ages blast.

I feel resolved to try,
   My wish to prove, my calling to pursue,
Or mount up from the earth into the sky,
   To show what Heaven can do.

My genius from a boy,
   Has fluttered like a bird within my heart;
But could not thus confined her powers employ,
   Impatient to depart.

She like a restless bird,
   Would spread her wing, her power to be unfurl'd,
And let her songs be loudly heard,
   And dart from world to world.







For What Binds Us
 

There are names for what binds us:
strong forces, weak forces.
Look around, you can see them:
the skin that forms in a half-empty cup,
nails rusting into the places they join,
joints dovetailed on their own weight. 
The way things stay so solidly
wherever they've been set down--
and gravity, scientists say, is weak.

And see how the flesh grows back
across a wound, with a great vehemence,
more strong
than the simple, untested surface before.
There's a name for it on horses,
when it comes back darker and raised: proud flesh,

as all flesh,
is proud of its wounds, wears them
as honors given out after battle,
small triumphs pinned to the chest--

And when two people have loved each other
see how it is like a 
scar between their bodies,
stronger, darker, and proud;
how the black cord makes of them a single fabric
that nothing can tear or mend.

In a Station of the Metro
 

The apparition       of these faces       in the crowd   : 
Petals      on a wet, black    bough   .





Second Adam
 

Whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. 
 --Genesis 
When the Deluge had passed,
into my head, by twos, came the creeping things,
the horn of their jawbones shining, and the things of the air, 
wing-cases breaking like clasp knives, asking their names.

Storm-light colored their passing
with an animal imminence. They wheeled
on the pile of their plumage, in the dread of their animal being, 
and rode in the ark of my head

where the possible worked like a sea.
Nothing was given me there. Nothing was known. Feather and scale, 
concussions of muscle and fur, the whale and the name for the whale 
rose on the void like a waterspout, being, and ceasing to be:

till keel clashed and I spoke: mayfly,
wood-weasel, stingray, cormorant, mole--
choosing the syllables, holding a leaf to the torrent, 
unharmed and infallible, while Creation descended, in twos.






The Poet
 

Out of the deep and the dark, 
A sparkling mystery, a shape, 
Something perfect, 
Comes like the stir of the day: 
One whose breath is an odor, 
Whose eyes show the road to stars, 
The breeze in his face, 
The glory of heaven on his back. 
He steps like a vision hung in air, 
Diffusing the passion of eternity; 
His abode is the sunlight of morn, 
The music of eve his speech: 
In his sight, 
One shall turn from the dust of the grave, 
And move upward to the woodland.





(Over the green and yellow...)
 

          
                                              I 

         Over the green and yellow rice fields sweep the shadows of the autumn clouds, followed by the swift-chasing sun.
         The bees forget to sip their honey; drunken with the light they foolishly hum and hover; and the ducks in the sandy riverbank clamour in joy for mere nothing.
         None shall go back home, brothers, this morning, none shall go to work.
         We will take the blue sky by storm and plunder the space as we run.
         Laughters fly floating in the air like foams in the flood.
         Brothers, we shall squander our morning in futile songs.






(Keep me fully glad...)
 

          
                                                                II 

         Keep me fully glad with nothing. Only take my hand in your hand.
         In the gloom of the deepening night take up my heart and play with it as you list. Bind me close to you with nothing.
         I will spread myself out at your feet and lie still. Under this clouded sky I will meet silence with silence. I will become one with the night clasping the earth in my breast.
         Make my life glad with nothing.
         The rains sweep the sky from end to end. Jasmines in the wet untamable wind revel in their own perfume. The cloud-hidden stars thrill in secret. Let me fill to the full my heart with nothing but my own depth of joy.






(My soul is alight...)
 

                                                      III 


         My soul is alight with your infinitude of stars. Your world has broken upon me like a flood. The flowers of your garden blossom in my body. The joy of life that is everywhere burns like an incense in my heart. And the breath of all things plays on my life as on a pipe of reeds.







(O you mad, you superbly drunk!...)
 

                                                      IV 


O you mad, you superbly drunk!

If you kick open your doors and play the fool in public; 

If you empty your bag in a night, and snap your fingers at prudence;

If you walk in curious paths and play with useless things; 

Reck not rhyme or reason;

If you break the rudder in two unfurling your sails before the storm:

Then I will follow you, comrade, and be drunken and go to the dogs.


I have wasted my days and nights in the company of steady wise neighbors.

Much knowing has turned my hair grey, and much watching has made my sight dim.

For years I have gathered and heaped all scraps and fragments of things;

Crush them and dance upon them, and scatter them all to the winds!

For I know 'tis the height of wisdom to be drunken and go to the dogs.


Let all crooked scruples vanish, let me hopelessly lose my way.

Let a gust of wild giddiness come and sweep me away from my anchors.

The world is peopled with worthies, and workers useful and clever;

There are men who are easily the first, and men who come decently next:

Let them be happy and prosperous, and let me be foolishly futile.

For I know 'tis the end of all works to be drunken and go to the dogs.


I swear to surrender this moment all claim to the ranks of the sensible.

I let go my pride of learning and judgment of right and of wrong.

I'll shatter the vessel of memory, scattering the last drop of tears;

With the foam of the ruby red wine, I'll bathe and brighten my laughter.

The badge of the proper and prim I'll tear into shreds for the nonce.

I'll take the holy vow of being worthless, and be drunken and go to the dogs.







("Leave off your works, bride...)
 

V   

Leave off your works, bride. Listen, the guest has come. 
Do you hear, he is gently shaking the fastening chain of the door? 
Let not your anklets be loud, and your steps be too hurried to meet him. 
Leave off your works, bride, the guest has come, in the evening. 

No, it is not the wind, bride. Do not be frightened. 
It is the full-moon night of April, shadows are pale in the court-yard, the sky overhead is bright. 
Draw your veil over your face if you must, take the lamp from your room if you fear. 
No, it is not the wind, bride; do not be frightened.          

Have no word with him if you are shy, stand aside by the door when you meet him. 
If he asks you questions, lower your eyes in silence, if you wish. 
Do not let your bracelets jingle, when, lamp in hand, you lead him in. 
Have no word with him if you are shy. 

Have you not finished your works yet, bride? Listen, the guest has come.            
Have you not lit the lamp in the cowshed? 
Have you not got ready the offering basket for the evening service? 
Have you not put the auspicious red mark at the parting of your hair, and done your toilet for the night? 
         O bride, do you hear, the guest has come? 
         Have you not finished your works yet? 






(Come as you are...)
 

                                                      VI 


Come as you are, tarry not over your toilet.

If your braiding has come loose, if the parting of your hair be not straight, if the ribbons of your bodice be not fastened, do not mind.

Come as you are, tarry not over your toilet.


Come with quick steps over the grass.

If your feet are pale with the dew, if your anklets slacken, if pearls drop out of your chain, do not mind.

Come with quick steps over the grass.


Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky?

Flocks of cranes fly up from the further riverbank and fitful gusts of wind rush over the heath.

The anxious cattle run to their stalls in the village.

Do you see the clouds wrapping the sky?



In vain you light your toilet lamp; it flickers and goes out in the wind.

Surely, who would know that with lamp-black your eyelids are not touched? For your eyes are darker than rain clouds.

In vain you light your toilet lamp; it goes out.


Come as you are, tarry not over your toilet.

If the wreath is not woven, who cares? If the wrist-chain has not been tied, leave it by.

The sky is overcast with clouds; it is late.

Come as you are, tarry not over your toilet.





(Sing the song of the moment...)
 

                                                      VII


Sing the song of the moment in careless carols, in the transient light of the day;

Sing of the fleeting smiles that vanish and never look back;

Sing of the flowers that bloom and fade without regret.

Weave not in memory's thread the days that would glide into nights.

To the guests that must go bid God-speed, and wipe away all traces of their steps.

Let the moments end in moments with their cargo of fugitive songs.


With both hands snap the fetters you made with your own heart chords;

Take to your breast with a smile what is easy and simple and near.

Today is the festival of phantoms that know not when they die.          

Let your laughter flush in meaningless mirth like twinkles of light on the ripples;

Let your life lightly dance on the verge of Time like a dew on the tip of a leaf.

Strike in the chords of your harp the fitful murmurs of moments.







Stump
 

1. 

Today they cut down the oak.   
Strong men climbed with ropes   
in the brittle tree. 
The exhaust of a gasoline saw   
was blue in the branches. 

The oak had been dead a year. 
I remember the great sails of its branches   
rolling out green, a hundred and twenty feet up,   
and acorns thick on the lawn. 
Nine cities of squirrels lived in that tree. 

Yet I was happy that it was coming down.   
"Let it come down!" I kept saying to myself   
with a joy that was strange to me. 
Though the oak was the shade of old summers,   
I loved the guttural saw. 


       2. 

By night a bare trunk stands up fifteen feet   
and cords of firewood press 
on the twiggy frozen grass of the yard. 
One man works every afternoon for a week   
to cut the trunk gradually down. 

Bluish stains spread through the wood   
and make it harder to cut. 
He says they are the nails of a trapper   
who dried his pelts on the oak 
when badgers dug in the lawn. 

Near the ground he hacks for two days,   
knuckles scraping the stiff snow. 
His chain saw breaks three teeth. 
He cannot make the trunk smooth. He leaves   
one night after dark. 


       3. 

Roots stiffen under the ground 
and the frozen street, coiled around pipes and wires.   
The stump is a platform of blond wood   
in the gray winter. It is nearly level 
with the snow that covers the little garden around it.   
It is a door into the underground of old summers,   
but if I bend down to it, I am lost   
in crags and buttes of a harsh landscape   
that goes on forever. When snow melts   
the wood darkens into the ground;   
rain and thawed snow move deeply into the stump,   
backwards along the disused tunnels. 


       4. 

The edges of the trunk turn black.   
In the middle there is a pale overlay,   
like a wash of chalk on darkness. 
The desert of the winter 
has moved inside. 
I do not step on it now; I am used to it,   
like a rock, or a bush that does not grow. 

There is a sailing ship 
beached in the cove of a small island   
where the warm water is turquoise. 
The hulk leans over, full of rain and sand,   
and shore flowers grow from it. 
Then it is under full sail in the Atlantic,   
on a blue day, heading for the island. 

She has planted sweet alyssum 
in the holes where the wood was rotten. 
It grows thick, it bulges 
like flowers contending from a tight vase.   
Now the stump sinks downward into its roots   
with a cargo of rain 
and white blossoms that last into October. 






(Lest I should know you...)
 

                                                      VIII


Lest I should know you too easily, you play with me.

You blind me with flashes of laughter to hide your tears.

I know, I know your art;

You never say the word you would.


Lest I should prize you not, you elude me in a thousand ways.

Lest I should mix you with the crowd, you stand aside.

I know, I know your art;

You never walk the path you would.


Your claim is more than others; that is why you are silent.

With a playful carelessness you avoid my gifts.

I know, I know your art;

You never accept what you would.







(Amidst the rush and roar of life...)
 

                                                      IX


Amidst the rush and roar of life, O beauty, carved in stone, you stand mute and still, alone and aloof.

Great Time sits enamoured at your feet and repeats to you:

Speak, speak to me, my love; speak, my mute bride!

But your speech is shut up in stone, O you immovably fair! 







(Tell me if this is all true...)
 

                                                      X 


Tell me if this is all true, my lover? 

         tell me if it is true.

When the eyes of me flash their lightning on you, 

         dark clouds in your breast make stormy answer;

Is it then true 

         that the dew drops fall from the night when I am seen, 

         and the morning light is glad when it wraps my body?


Is it true, is it true, that your love 

         travelled alone through ages and worlds in search of me? 

         that when you found me at last, your age-long desire 

         found utter peace in my gentle speech and my eyes and lips and flowing hair?


Is it then true 

         that the mystery of the Infinite is written on this little brow of mine?         

Tell me, my lover, if all this is true!







The Pattern
 

As soon as   
I speak, I   
speaks. It 

wants to   
be free but   
impassive lies 

in the direction   
of its 
words. Let 

x equal x, x   
also 
equals x. I 

speak to   
hear myself   
speak? I 

had not thought   
that some- 
thing had such 

undone. It   
was an idea   
of mine.





(I asked of Destiny...)
 

                                                      XI


I asked of Destiny, Tell me who with relentless hand pushes me on?

Destiny told me to look behind.

I turned and saw my own self behind pushing forward the self in front.







The Window
 

Position is where you   
put it, where it is, 
did you, for example, that 

large tank there, silvered,   
with the white church along- 
side, lift 

all that, to what   
purpose? How   
heavy the slow 

world is with   
everything put   
in place. Some 

man walks by, a   
car beside him on   
the dropped 

road, a leaf of   
yellow color is   
going to 

fall. It 
all drops into   
place. My 

face is heavy 
with the sight. I can   
feel my eye breaking.





(With a glance of your eyes...)
 

                                                      XII


With a glance of your eyes you could plunder all the wealth of songs struck from poets' harps, fair woman!

But for their praises you have no ear; therefore do I come to praise you.

You could humble at your feet the proudest heads of all the world;

But it is your loved ones, unknown to fame, whom you choose to worship; therefore I worship you.

Your perfect arms would add glory to kingly splendor with their touch;

But you use them to sweep away the dust, and to make clean your humble home; therefore I am filled with awe.







(We both live in the same village...)
 

                                                      XIII


We both live in the same village and that is our one piece of joy.

The yellow bird sings in their tree and makes my heart dance with gladness.

Her pair of pet lambs come to graze near the shade of our garden. 

If they stray into our barley field I take them up in my arms.          

The name of our village is Khanjuna, and Anjana they call our river;

My name is known to all the village and her name is Ranjana.


Only one field lies between us.

Bees that have hived in our grove go to seek honey in theirs.

Flowers launched from their landing stairs come floating by the stream where we bathe.

Baskets of dried kusm flowers come from their fields to our market.

The name of our village is Khanjuna, and Anjana they call our river;

My name is known to all the village and her name is Ranjana.


The lane that winds to their house is fragrant in the spring with mango flowers.          

When their linseed is ripe for harvest, the hemp is in bloom in our field.

The stars that smile on their cottage send us the same twinkling look.

The rain that floods their tank makes glad our Kadam forest.

The name of our village is Khanjuna, and Anjana they call our river;

My name is known to all the village and her name is Ranjana.







(I found a few old letters...)
 

          
                                                                XIV

         I found a few old letters of mine carefully hidden in thy box--a few small toys for thy memory to play with. With a timorous heart thou didst try to steal these trifles from the turbulent stream of time which washes away planets and stars, and didst say, These are only mine! Alas, there is no one now who can claim them--who is able to pay their price; yet they are still here. Is there no love in this world to rescue thee from utter loss, even like this love of thine that saved these letters with such fond care?
         O woman, thou camest for a moment to my side and touched me with the great mystery of the woman that there is in the heart of creation--she who ever gives back to God his own outflow of sweetness; who is the eternal love and beauty and youth; who dances in bubbling streams and sings in the morning light; who with heaving waves suckles the thirsty earth and whose mercy melts in rain; in whom the eternal one breaks in two in joy that can contain itself no more and overflows in the pain of love.






Postlude
 

Now that I have cooled to you 
Let there be gold of tarnished masonry, 
Temples soothed by the sun to ruin    
That sleep utterly. 
Give me hand for the dances,             
Ripples at Philae, in and out,          
And lips, my Lesbian,          
Wall flowers that once were flame.          

Your hair is my Carthage          
And my arms the bow,          
And our words arrows          
To shoot the stars          
Who from that misty sea          
Swarm to destroy us.          

But you there beside me--          
Oh how shall I defy you,          
Who wound me in the night          
With breasts shining          
Like Venus and like Mars?          
The night that is shouting Jason          
When the loud eaves rattle          
As with waves above me          
Blue at the prow of my desire.





The Buffalo Coat
 

I see him moving, in his legendary fleece,
Between the superhighway and an Algonquin stone axe; 
Between the wild tribes, in their lost heat,
And the dark blizzard of my Grandfather's coat; 
Cold with the outdoor cold caught in the curls,
Smelling of the world before the poll tax.

And between the new macadam and the Scalp Act 
They got him by the short hair; had him clipped 
Who once was wild--and all five senses wild--
Printing the wild with his hoof's inflated script 
Before the times was money in the bank, 
Before it was a crime to be so mild.

But history is a fact, and moves on feet
Sharper than his, toward wallows deeper than. 
And the myth that covered all his moving parts, 
Grandfather's time had turned into a coat;
And what kept warm then, in the true world's cold 
Is old and cold in a world his death began.

Like Rousseau
 

She stands beside me, stands away,   
the vague indifference 
of her dreams. Dreaming, to go on,   
and go on there, like animals fleeing   
the rise of the earth. But standing   
intangible, my lust a worked anger 
a sweating close covering, for the crudely salty soul. 

Then back off, and where you go? Box of words   
and pictures. Steel balloons tied to our mouths.   
The room fills up, and the house. Street tilts.   
City slides, and buildings slide into the river.   
What is there left, to destroy? That is not close,   
or closer. Leaning away in the angle of language.   
Pumping and pumping, all our eyes criss cross 
and flash. It is the lovers pulling down empty structures.   
They wait and touch and watch their dreams   
eat the morning.





Things We Dreamt We Died For
 

Flags of all sorts. 
The literary life. 
Each time we dreamt we'd done   
the gentlemanly thing, 
covering our causes 
in closets full of bones 
to remove ourselves forever   
from dearest possibilities, 
the old weapons re-injured us,   
the old armies conscripted us,   
and we gave in to getting even,   
a little less like us 
if a lot less like others. 
Many, thus, gained fame 
in the way of great plunderers,   
retiring to the university 
to cultivate grand plunder-gardens   
in the service of literature,   
the young and no more wars.   
Their continuing tributes   
make them our greatest saviors,   
whose many fortunes are followed   
by the many who have not one.





The World
 

I wanted so ably 
to reassure you, I wanted 
the man you took to be me, 

to comfort you, and got 
up, and went to the window, 
pushed back, as you asked me to, 

the curtain, to see 
the outline of the trees 
in the night outside. 

The light, love, 
the light we felt then, 
greyly, was it, that 

came in, on us, not 
merely my hands or yours, 
or a wetness so comfortable, 

but in the dark then 
as you slept, the grey 
figure came so close 

and leaned over, 
between us, as you 
slept, restless, and 

my own face had to 
see it, and be seen by it, 
the man it was, your 

grey lost tired bewildered 
brother, unused, untaken-- 
hated by love, and dead, 

but not dead, for an 
instant, saw me, myself 
the intruder, as he was not. 

I tried to say, it is 
all right, she is 
happy, you are no longer 

needed. I said, 
he is dead, and he 
went as you shifted 

and woke, at first afraid, 
then knew by my own knowing 
what had happened-- 

and the light then 
of the sun coming 
for another morning 
in the world. 






What the Rattlesnake Said
 

The Moon's a little prairie-dog.   
He shivers through the night.   
He sits upon his hill and cries   
For fear that I will bite. 

The Sun's a broncho.   He's afraid   
Like every other thing,   
And trembles morning, noon and night 
Lest I should spring and sting.





from Briggflatts
 

I 

Brag, sweet tenor bull, 
descant on Rawthey's madrigal,   
each pebble its part   
for the fells' late spring.   
Dance tiptoe, bull,   
black against may.   
Ridiculous and lovely   
chase hurdling shadows   
morning into noon.   
May on the bull's hide   
and through the dale   
furrows fill with may,   
paving the slowworm's way. 

A mason times his mallet   
to a lark's twitter, 
listening while the marble rests,   
lays his rule 
at a letter's edge, 
fingertips checking, 
till the stone spells a name   
naming none, 
a man abolished. 
Painful lark, labouring to rise!   
The solemn mallet says:   
In the grave's slot 
he lies. We rot. 

Decay thrusts the blade,   
wheat stands in excrement   
trembling. Rawthey trembles.   
Tongue stumbles, ears err   
for fear of spring. 
Rub the stone with sand,   
wet sandstone rending   
roughness away. Fingers   
ache on the rubbing stone. 
The mason says: Rocks 
happen by chance. 
No one here bolts the door, 
love is so sore. 

Stone smooth as skin,   
cold as the dead they load   
on a low lorry by night.   
The moon sits on the fell   
but it will rain. 
Under sacks on the stone   
two children lie, 
hear the horse stale,   
the mason whistle,   
harness mutter to shaft,   
felloe to axle squeak,   
rut thud the rim, 
crushed grit. 

Stocking to stocking, jersey to jersey, 
head to a hard arm, 
they kiss under the rain,   
bruised by their marble bed.   
In Garsdale, dawn; 
at Hawes, tea from the can.   
Rain stops, sacks 
steam in the sun, they sit up.   
Copper-wire moustache,   
sea-reflecting eyes 
and Baltic plainsong speech   
declare: By such rocks 
men killed Bloodaxe. 

Fierce blood throbs in his tongue, 
lean words. 
Skulls cropped for steel caps 
huddle round Stainmore. 
Their becks ring on limestone, 
whisper to peat. 
The clogged cart pushes the horse downhill.   
In such soft air 
they trudge and sing, 
laying the tune frankly on the air. 
All sounds fall still, 
feilside bleat, 
hide-and-seek peewit. 

Her pulse their pace, 
palm countering palm, 
till a trench is filled,   
stone white as cheese 
jeers at the dale. 
Knotty wood, hard to rive, 
smoulders to ash; 
smell of October apples. 
The road again,   
at a trot. 
Wetter, warmed, they watch 
the mason meditate   
on name and date. 

Rain rinses the road, 
the bull streams and laments. 
Sour rye porridge from the hob 
with cream and black tea,   
meat, crust and crumb.   
Her parents in bed 
the children dry their clothes. 
He has untied the tape 
of her striped flannel drawers 
before the range. Naked   
on the pricked rag mat   
his fingers comb 
thatch of his manhood's home. 

Gentle generous voices weave 
over bare night 
words to confirm and delight 
till bird dawn. 
Rainwater from the butt   
she fetches and flannel 
to wash him inch by inch,   
kissing the pebbles. 
Shining slowworm part of the marvel.   
The mason stirs: 
Words! 
Pens are too light. 
Take a chisel to write. 

Every birth a crime, 
every sentence life. 
Wiped of mould and mites   
would the ball run true?   
No hope of going back.   
Hounds falter and stray,   
shame deflects the pen. 
Love murdered neither bleeds nor stifles   
but jogs the draftsman's elbow.   
What can he, changed, tell   
her, changed, perhaps dead?   
Delight dwindles. Blame   
stays the same. 

Brief words are hard to find,   
shapes to carve and discard:   
Bloodaxe, king of York, 
king of Dublin, king of Orkney. 
Take no notice of tears;   
letter the stone to stand   
over love laid aside lest   
insufferable happiness impede 
flight to Stainmore, 
to trace 
lark, mallet, 
becks, flocks 
and axe knocks. 

Dung will not soil the slowworm's   
mosaic. Breathless lark 
drops to nest in sodden trash; 
Rawthey truculent, dingy. 
Drudge at the mallet, the may is down,   
fog on fells. Guilty of spring 
and spring's ending 
amputated years ache after 
the bull is beef, love a convenience.   
It is easier to die than to remember.   
Name and date 
split in soft slate 
a few months obliterate. 






Trees
 

I think that I shall never see 
A poem lovely as a tree. 

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest 
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast; 

A tree that looks at God all day, 
And lifts her leafy arms to pray; 

A tree that may in Summer wear 
A nest of robins in her hair; 

Upon whose bosom snow has lain; 
Who intimately lives with rain. 

Poems are made by fools like me, 
But only God can make a tree.





Letters to Walt Whitman
 

I

I hear you are whispering there O stars of heaven,
O suns--O grass of graves. . .
If you do not say anything how can I say anything?

Let us tunnel

the air
(as a mole's green galleries)
toward the ultimate

cornfield
--the square of gold, & green, & of tassle

that rustles back at us--


let us burrow in 
to a susurration, the dense starlings,

of the real--
the huge
sunflowers waving back at us,

as we move


--the great grassy world

that surrounds us,
singing.




II

Unseen buds, infinite, hidden well,
Under the snow and ice, under the darkness,
in every square or cubic inch,
Germinal, exquisite, in delicate lace, microscopic. . .

Slant sheen/wrinkled silver.

Foxtail & lace-fly out of the vast organic slough
of the earth,
& the exquisite eye
--as myriad upon myriad of dandelions--

seeding itself on the air.


MIRROS OF THE DARK WATER.

Poems beginning germinal in the instant
--reeling out, unravelling, tendril & silken, into the air--
ethereal growths,

sudden, & peculiar as mushrooms?
Uncrumpling
as moths from cocoons--

under the darkness,
pale wings,
slight densities out of the breadth of summer nights?

A largesse!

Argus-eyed & instant.




III

These I compass'd around by a thick cloud of spirits. . .

Solitary, smelling the earthy smell
. . . a handful of sage.

 
Here, out of my pocket--
twigs of maple & current-stems,
copious bunches of wild orange, chestnut, lilac!

.  .  .

But I have come O Walt
for the interchange, promised, of calamus,
masculine, sweet-smelling root,
between us:

you, who lie in Camden, still waiting for death,
still exuding an earthy smell
--your pockets redolent with sage--

the pond-soil still clinging to your fingers,
aromatic with plucking
calamus.

Calamus, sweet flag',
that still thrusts itself up,

that seasonally thrusts itself up for lovers.




 IV

The press of my foot to the earth
springs a hundred affections,
They scorn the best I can do to relate them. . .

(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place, The bright
suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see
are in their place. . .)

I see a galaxy of gnats,
close-knit, & whirling through the air,
apparently for the pure joy of the circle, the jocund
inter-twinement.

And through this seethe,
I see the trees,
the blue accumulations of the air
beyond,
perceived
as through a sieve--

& all, through other, & invisible, convolutions:
those galaxies in a head

close-packed & wheeling.


I am invovled with the palpable
as well
as that impalpable,

where I walk, mysteries catch at my heels
& cling
like cockle-burrs.
My affinities are infinite, & from moment to moment
I propagate new symmetries, new

hinges, new edges.




V

Earth, my likeness
.  .  .
I, too, have plucked a stalk of grass

from your ample prairie, Walt,
& have savored whole fields of a summer's hay in it--

I have known your Appalachian length, the heights
of your Sierra
--I have unearthed the roots of calamus
you left at the margin

of many, hidden ponds,
& have exchanged it with the few, select,
lovers.

I have lain in the open night,

till my shoulders felt twin roots, & the tree of my sight
swayed,
among the stars.

I, too, have plucked a stalk of grass

from your ample prairie, Walt.




VI

Hefts of the moving world

at innocent gambols silently rising, freshly exuding,
Scooting obliquely high and low.
Dappled concave pulsing to the cricket's scrape:

the scud & mottle of sudden
dilations, divigations & night-jars.
CHURR, CHURR.

Mackerel & Fleecy,

in alternate dusks & 
brightnesses,
a restlessness tumbling its

meadows, yeasty,
churning,
its black & white heifers working the cosmic cud

--a moon-humped bulge, as of the sea, swelling, irresistibly--

CHURR, CHURR
I, too, caught in its strange tussle
its tough, prosy commas

punctuating the surge of me, out, & out,

lifting & proliferating: drifts
elastic, supple,

effuse.




VII

A trasparent base

shuddering. . .
under and through the universe


rides the brows of the sounding whales

& swells in the thousand
cow-bells.

It undulates under each meadow
to thunder in the hills, the crow's call,

& the apple-falls.

I hear it always, in a huge & earthy fugue,
from inner ear, to farthest owls:


the circulatory music of all things, omnipresent & in flux.




VIII

This grass is dark
. . . to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.
Dark as heat-lightening--

mirage of flesh!
--purifying the air electric.

The intimate kernel putting forth a final leaf

from The Valley Of The Many-Colored Grasses.
An Aurora Borealis

dawning'
incorporeal.

All day the figures continued to move
about
& to bend over the green mounds

in the warm air.


Shades limned exact in the prismatic spheres
of death.

O SPEARS! TRANSPARENCIES!




IX

Landscapes projected masculine,
full-sized and golden. . .
With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent,

sinking sun, burning, expanding the air.

But are these landscapes to be imagined,
or an actual
Kansas--the central, earthy, prosaic core of us?

Or is the seen always winged, as eidolon only to us--& never
the certain capture
of great, golden, unembroidered

slabs?


All is Oz.
The dusty cottonwoods, by the creek,
rustle an Emerald City.

And the mystic, immemorial city

is rooted in earth.

All is Oz & inextricable,

bound up in the unquenchable flames of double suns.




X

The smoke of my own breath,
Echoes, ripples,
buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread,
crotch and vine.

I have put my ear close & close to these lips, heard them
to the last syllable
spun out--
respirations of an encircling night
--a cat-bird's ventriloquil
whisper-song'

interspersing melodics with soft mews, brushing &
teasing my ears with its intimacies
as if surrounded

by many muted birds in the dark.

And ever these nights of love-root', sweet
calamus, embrace me, elusive, illusive, their buzz'd whisper
ever
at my ear.

Echoes, ripples.
There are Camerados, Walt--still they come.
And nights yet to come

to whisper you
to the ears of others.






The Correspondence-School Instructor Says Goodbye to His Poetry Students
 

Goodbye, lady in Bangor, who sent me   
snapshots of yourself, after definitely hinting   
you were beautiful; goodbye, 
Miami Beach urologist, who enclosed plain   
brown envelopes for the return of your very 
"Clinical Sonnets; goodbye, manufacturer   
of brassieres on the Coast, whose eclogues 
give the fullest treatment in literature yet 
to the sagging breast motif; goodbye, you in San Quentin,   
who wrote, "Being German my hero is Hitler,   
instead of "Sincerely yours, at the end of long,   
neat-scripted letters extolling the Pre-Raphaelites: 

I swear to you, it was just my way   
of cheering myself up, as I licked 
the stamped, self-addressed envelopes,   
the game I had of trying to guess   
which one of you, this time,   
had poisoned his glue. I did care.   
I did read each poem entire.   
I did say everything I thought   
in the mildest words I knew. And now, 
in this poem, or chopped prose, no better,   
I realize, than those troubled lines   
I kept sending back to you, 
I have to say I am relieved it is over: 
at the end I could feel only pity 
for that urge toward more life 
your poems kept smothering in words, the smell   
of which, days later, tingled in your nostrils   
as new, God-given impulses 
to write. 

Goodbye, 
you who are, for me, the postmarks again 
of imaginary towns--Xenia, Burnt Cabins, Hornell-- 
their solitude given away in poems, only their loneliness kept.





Of Late
 

"Stephen Smith, University of Iowa sophomore, burned what he said was his draft card 
and Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned what he said was himself. 
You, Robert McNamara, burned what you said was a concentration 
of the Enemy Aggressor. 
No news medium troubled to put it in quotes. 

And Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned what he said was himself. 
He said it with simple materials such as would be found in your kitchen. 
In your office you were informed. 
Reporters got cracking frantically on the mental disturbance angle. 
So far nothing turns up. 

Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned, and while burning, screamed. 
No tip-off. No release. 
Nothing to quote, to manage to put in quotes. 
Pity the unaccustomed hesitance of the newspaper editorialists.   
Pity the press photographers, not called. 

Norman Morrison, Quaker, of Baltimore Maryland, burned and was burned and said 
all that there is to say in that language. 
Twice what is said in yours. 
It is a strange sect, Mr. McNamara, under advice to try   
the whole of a thought in silence, and to oneself.





Monuments for a Friendly Girl at a Tenth Grade Party
 

The only relics left are those long 
spangled seconds our school clock chipped out   
when you crossed the social hall 
and we found each other alive, 
by our glances never to accept our town's   
ways, torture for advancement, 
nor ever again be prisoners by choice. 

Now I learn you died 
serving among the natives of Garden City,   
Kansas, part of a Peace Corps 
before governments thought of it. 

Ruth, over the horizon your friends eat   
foreign chaff and have addresses like titles,   
but for you the crows and hawks patrol   
the old river. May they never 
forsake you, nor you need monuments   
other than this I make, and the one 
I hear clocks chip in that world we found.





His Suicide
 

He looked down at his withering body and saw a hair
 near his navel, swaying.
  
 And now he saw his other hairs rise up.
  
 He felt a hectic current in his veins.
 Looking within, he saw the bubbling of his blood.
  
 He cursed his fever, saying:
 "It is the chemistry of prayer.
 It increases in frequency,
 seeding panic to all my being.
 My cells swell with the liquid of guilt they fabricate,
 juices of hatred eat my belly
 my corpuscles make war in me as they devour each other.
 My head heats in the combustion of anxiety,
 I am polluted by the secretions of my soul's decay,
 while my brain wears away
 with the scratching night and day
 on the encephalograph of prayer.
 I grow monstrous with the leukemia of the world.
  
 And he heard the hair say: "Hear me.
 And he saw it grow gray as it waved.
 All his hairs he saw whiten,
 and, numberless, wilt from their erect electric listening.
 He saw them topple from their roots.
 "How dare you! he cursed them.
 There surged a brief resuscitation to his body.
 His heart took heart and pounded twice
 with the health of fear
 But then the plague of prayer redoubled and overwhelmed him.
  
 In his feebleness he raged, and said:
 "I will tear out this evil and free it.

With his withered hands he tore the remaining hairs
 from his body and head.
 With his nails he opened his breast,
 and with his fist he exploded his heart,
 which erupted, a black and red volcano.
  
 As his brain tasted, for the first time,
 the birth of his doom,
 he came a rolling tide, a floating mountain of ecstasy.
 "I see you! I love you! his eyes cried,
 overflowing with his bright blood.
 "You were the light of the world
 that are now my gushing tears--
 the kind and fiery tears of chaos, that wash my eyes
 with the cure of oblivion.
  
 "He hears us! cried his sick blood
 pouring from his ears.
 "Even as of old he heard our hair before it perished.
  
 With his last strength, the chemistry of prayer,
 a few drops of his blood coagulated.
 That clot whirled out, free, in the vortex of the universe.





All the Dead Soldiers
 

In the chill rains of the early winter I hear something--
A puling anger, a cold wind stiffened by flying bone--
Out of the north ... 
                               and remember, then, what's up there: 
That ghost-bank: home: Amchitka: boot hill ....

They must be very tired, those ghosts; no flesh sustains them
And the bones rust in the rain.
                                              Reluctant to go into the earth
The skulls gleam: wet; the dog-tag forgets the name;
The statistics (wherein they were young) like their crosses, are weathering out,

They must be very tired.
                                     But I see them riding home, 
Nightly: crying weak lust and rage: to stand in the dark, 
Forlorn in known rooms, unheard near familiar beds: 
Where lie the aging women: who were so lovely: once.





Now and then
 

                                                                          for Kenward Elmslie

The Blue Booby
 

The blue booby lives 
on the bare rocks 
of Galpagos 
and fears nothing. 
It is a simple life: 
they live on fish, 
and there are few predators.   
Also, the males do not   
make fools of themselves   
chasing after the young   
ladies. Rather, 
they gather the blue 
objects of the world 
and construct from them 

a nest--an occasional   
Gaulois package, 
a string of beads, 
a piece of cloth from   
a sailor's suit. This   
replaces the need for   
dazzling plumage;   
in fact, in the past   
fifty million years 
the male has grown 
considerably duller,   
nor can he sing well.   
The female, though, 

asks little of him-- 
the blue satisfies her   
completely, has   
a magical effect 
on her. When she returns 
from her day of 
gossip and shopping, 
she sees he has found her   
a new shred of blue foil:   
for this she rewards him   
with her dark body, 
the stars turn slowly 
in the blue foil beside them   
like the eyes of a mild savior.





Eros Turannos
 

She fears him, and will always ask 
   What fated her to choose him; 
She meets in his engaging mask                   
   All reasons to refuse him; 
But what she meets and what she fears 
Are less than are the downward years, 
Drawn slowly to the foamless weirs 
   Of age, were she to lose him. 

Between a blurred sagacity 
   That once had power to sound him, 
And Love, that will not let him be 
   The Judas that she found him, 
Her pride assuages her almost, 
As if it were alone the cost.-- 
He sees that he will not be lost, 
   And waits and looks around him. 

A sense of ocean and old trees 
   Envelops and allures him; 
Tradition, touching all he sees 
   Beguiles and reassures him; 
And all her doubts of what he says 
Are dimmed with what she knows of days-- 
Till even prejudice delays 
   And fades, and she secures him. 

The falling leaf inaugurates 
   The reign of her confusion; 
The pounding wave reverberates 
   The dirge of her illusion; 
And home, where passion lived and died, 
Becomes a place where she can hide, 
While all the town and harbor side 
   Vibrate with her seclusion. 

We tell you, tapping on our brows, 
   The story as it should be,-- 
As if the story of a house 
   Were told, or ever could be; 
We'll have no kindly veil between 
Her visions and those we have seen,-- 
As if we guessed what hers have been, 
   Or what they are or would be. 

Meanwhile we do no harm; for they 
   That with a god have striven, 
Not hearing much of what we say, 
   Take what the god has given; 
Though like waves breaking it may be, 
Or like a changed familiar tree, 
Or like a stairway to the sea 
   Where down the blind are driven.





Chicago
 

Hog Butcher for the World, 
   Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, 
   Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler; 
   Stormy, husky, brawling, 
   City of the Big Shoulders: 

They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I have seen your painted women under the gas lamps luring the farm boys. 
And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to kill again. 
And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the faces of women and children I have seen the marks of wanton hunger. 
And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer and say to them: 
Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning. 
Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities; 
Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning as a savage pitted against the wilderness, 
   Bareheaded, 
   Shoveling, 
   Wrecking, 
   Planning, 
   Building, breaking, rebuilding, 
Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with white teeth, 
Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young man laughs, 
Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has never lost a battle, 
Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse, and under his ribs the heart of the people, 
                   Laughing! 
Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of Youth, half-naked, sweating, proud to be Hog Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation.





Jan Kubelik
 

Your bow swept over a string, and a long low note quivered to the air.

(A mother of Bohemia sobs over a new child perfect learning to suck milk.)


Your bow ran fast over all the high strings fluttering and wild.

(All the girls in Bohemia are laughing on a Sunday afternoon in the hills with their lovers.)







The Harbor
 

Passing through huddled and ugly walls,

By doorways where women haggard

Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,

Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,

Out from the huddled and ugly walls,

I came sudden, at the city's edge,

On a blue burst of lake,

Long lake waves breaking under the sun

On a spray-flung curve of shore;

And a fluttering storm of gulls,

Masses of great gray wings

And flying white bellies

Veering and wheeling free in the open.







The Hammer
 

I have seen 

The old gods go

And the new gods come.


Day by day

And year by year

The idols fall

And the idols rise.


Today

I worship the hammer.







At a Window
 

Give me hunger, 

O you gods that sit and give 

The world its orders. 

Give me hunger, pain and want, 

Shut me out with shame and failure 

From your doors of gold and fame, 

Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger! 


But leave me a little love, 

A voice to speak to me in the day end, 

A hand to touch me in the dark room 

Breaking the long loneliness. 

In the dusk of day-shapes 

Blurring the sunset, 

One little wandering, western star 

Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow. 

Let me go to the window, 

Watch there the day-shapes of dusk 

And wait and know the coming 

Of a little love.







Lost
 

Desolate and lone 
All night long on the lake 
Where fog trails and mist creeps, 
The whistle of a boat 
Calls and cries unendingly, 
Like some lost child 
In tears and trouble 
Hunting the harbor's breast 
And the harbor's eyes. 






Who Am I?
 

My head knocks against the stars. 
My feet are on the hilltops. 
My finger-tips are in the valleys and shores of universal life. 
Down in the sounding foam of primal things I reach my hands and play with pebbles of destiny. 
I have been to hell and back many times. 
I know all about heaven, for I have talked with God. 
I dabble in the blood and guts of the terrible. 
I know the passionate seizure of beauty 
And the marvelous rebellion of man at all signs reading "Keep Off." 

My name is Truth and I am the most elusive captive in the universe. 






Momus
 

Momus is the name men give your face, 

The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle

Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,

Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.


                  Yes, Momus,

Men have flung your face in bronze

To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.

They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,

Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;

All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones

Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes   and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.


I wonder, Momus,

Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter

On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.

A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,

You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;

Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,

Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women

Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,

And blood drops of undiminishing war.





The Road and the End
 

I shall foot it

Down the roadway in the dusk,

Where shapes of hunger wander

And the fugitives of pain go by.


I shall foot it

In the silence of the morning,

See the night slur into dawn,

Hear the slow great winds arise

Where tall trees flank the way

And shoulder toward the sky.


The broken boulders by the road

Shall not commemorate my ruin.

Regret shall be the gravel under foot.

I shall watch for

Slim birds swift of wing

That go where wind and ranks of thunder

Drive the wild processionals of rain.


The dust of the travelled road

Shall touch my hands and face.





Old Love and New
 

In my heart the old love   
   Struggled with the new,   
It was ghostly waking   
   All night through.    

Dear things, kind things   
   That my old love said,   
Ranged themselves reproachfully   
   Round my bed.    

But I could not heed them,   
   For I seemed to see   
Dark eyes of my new love   
   Fixed on me.    

Old love, old love,   
   How can I be true?   
Shall I be faithless to myself   
   Or to you?





Over the Roofs
 

I 

Oh chimes set high on the sunny tower   
    Ring on, ring on unendingly, 
Make all the hours a single hour,   
For when the dusk begins to flower,   
    The man I love will come to me! ... 

But no, go slowly as you will, 
    I should not bid you hasten so,   
For while I wait for love to come,   
Some other girl is standing dumb, 
    Fearing her love will go. 


       II 

Oh white steam over the roofs, blow high!   
    Oh chimes in the tower ring clear and free!   
Oh sun awake in the covered sky, 
    For the man I love, loves me! ... 

Oh drifting steam disperse and die, 
    Oh tower stand shrouded toward the south,-- 
Fate heard afar my happy cry, 
    And laid her finger on my mouth. 


       III 

The dusk was blue with blowing mist,   
    The lights were spangles in a veil,   
And from the clamor far below 
    Floated faint music like a wail. 

It voiced what I shall never speak, 
    My heart was breaking all night long, 
But when the dawn was hard and gray,   
    My tears distilled into a song. 


       IV 

I said, "I have shut my heart   
    As one shuts an open door, 
That Love may starve therein   
    And trouble me no more. 

But over the roofs there came 
    The wet new wind of May, 
And a tune blew up from the curb 
    Where the street-pianos play. 

My room was white with the sun   
    And Love cried out to me, 
"I am strong, I will break your heart   
    Unless you set me free.





Debt
 

What do I owe to you            
   Who loved me deep and long? 
You never gave my spirit wings   
   Nor gave my heart a song.    

But oh, to him I loved,            
   Who loved me not at all, 
I owe the little open gate   
   That led through heaven's wall.





September Midnight
 

Lyric night of the lingering Indian Summer,
Shadowy fields that are scentless but full of singing, 
Never a bird, but the passionless chant of insects, 
       Ceaseless, insistent.   

The grasshopper's horn, and far-off, high in the maples, 
The wheel of a locust leisurely grinding the silence 
Under a moon waning and worn, broken, 
       Tired with summer.    

Let me remember you, voices of little insects,
Weeds in the moonlight, fields that are tangled with asters, 
Let me remember, soon will the winter be on us,
       Snow-hushed and heavy.   

Over my soul murmur your mute benediction,
While I gaze, O fields that rest after harvest,
As those who part look long in the eyes they lean to, 
       Lest they forget them.





Photographs
 

Proof Sheets: 36 Prints
 
 These photographs are the index of an hour,
            memory clocked along negative margins:
                        one through twelve, one through twelve, one
                         through twelve.
  
 Even in a sequence there is choice,
           as when I chose not to photograph silences between words--
  
 choice of the parted lips--
           or choose now a sequence out of time.
                        Scissors: chopped time.
  
 Rearrangement is good:
           You are characters in a drama called then.
  
 You are figures for mythology.
           I shall make Phaedra blonde, Theseus dark, Hippolytus
           blonde--
  
 blue eyes: blue eyes; that will do--
           Antigone singing in the graveyard wind,
  
 a twelve-year old who is Jocasta alternate weeks.
           Neither imagination nor my willing flesh can move this
           hand
  
 one fraction of an inch;
           a shift of stance could have juxtaposed mouths.
                         The fixed frame
  
 is the drama:
            Hippolytus at banquet;
                    Phaedra in her chamber,
                                  behind her that painting blurred
  
 into an omen,
           as if Theseus were Creon, Meleager, shepherd, faun;
                    Oedipus barefoot, hairskin beast;
                              Antigone maenad, Helen, Artemis.
  
                                        Only out-of-focus figures move.
 






Eschatology
 

I accompany this life's events like a personal journalist:   
"Little did she know when she got in the car that afternoon ...; 
or "Despite inauspicious beginnings, 
this was to be their happiest year. 

Little did I expect that our horoscopes would prove true.   
And how could we foresee an answer to 
that frankly secular prayer, we with so little faith   
as to be false prophets to our most fortunate gifts. 

I am glad when doom fails. Inept apocalypse 
is a specialty of the times: the suffering of the rich 
at the hand of riches; the second and third comings of wars. 

Shouldn't we refuse prediction 
that the untried today is guilty, that immeasurable   
as this child's hope is, it will break tomorrow?





To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Nothing
 

Now all the truth is out, 
Be secret and take defeat 
From any brazen throat, 
For how can you compete, 
Being honor bred, with one 
Who were it proved he lies 
Were neither shamed in his own 
Nor in his neighbors' eyes; 
Bred to a harder thing 
Than Triumph, turn away 
And like a laughing string 
Whereon mad fingers play 
Amid a place of stone, 
Be secret and exult, 
Because of all things known 
That is most difficult.





Domes
 

for John Godfrey
1. Animals 

Carved--indicated, actually, from solid 
Blocks of wood, the copper-, cream-, and chocolate-colored   
Cows we bought in Salzburg form a tiny herd. 
          And in Dr. Gachet's etching, six 
Or seven universal poses are assumed by cats. 

Misery, hypocrisy, greed: A dying 
Mouse, a cat, and a flock of puzzled blackbirds wearing   
Uniforms and frock coats exhibit these traits. 
          Formally outlasting the motive 
Of their creation with a poetry at once too vague 

And too precise to do anything with but 
Worship, they seem to have just blundered into our lives   
By accident, completely comprehending 
          Everything we find so disturbing 
About them; but they never speak. They never even move 

From the positions in which Grandville or some   
Anonymous movie-poster artist has left them,   
A sort of ghostly wolf, a lizard, an ape 
          And a huge dog. And their eyes, looking   
At nothing, manage to see everything invisible 

To ours, even with all the time in the world 
To see everything we think we have to see. And tell   
Of this in the only way we really can: 
          With a remark as mild as the air 
In which it is to be left hanging; or a stiff scream, 

Folded like a sheet of paper over all 
The horrible memories of everything we were   
Going to have. That vanished before our eyes 
          As we woke up to nothing but these, 
Our words, poor animals whose home is in another world. 


       2. Summer Home 

Tiny outbursts of sunlight play 
On the tips of waves that look like tacks   
Strewn on the surface of the bay. 
Up the coast the water backs up 
Behind a lofty, wooded island. Here,   
According to photographs, it is less 
Turbulent and blue; but much clearer.   
It seems to exercise the sunlight less   
Reflecting it, allowing beaten silver sheets 
To roam like water across a kitchen floor.   
Having begun gradually, the gravel beach   
Ends abruptly in the forest on the shore. 

Looked at from a distance, the forest seems   
Haunted. But safe within its narrow room   
Its light is innocent and green, as though   
Emerging from another dream of diminution   
We found ourselves of normal, human size,   
Attempting to touch the leaves above our heads.   
Why couldn't we have spent our summers here,   
Surrounded and growing up again? Or perhaps   
Arrive here late at night by car, much later   
In life? If only heaven were not too near   
For such sadness. And not within this world   
Which heaven has finally made clear. 

Green lichen fastened to a blue rock 
Like a map of the spot; cobwebs crowded with stars   
Of water; battalions of small white flowers.   
Such clarity, unrelieved except by our   
Delight and daily acquiescence in it,   
Presumably the effect of a natural setting   
Like this one, with all its expectations of ecstasy   
And peace, demands a future of forgetting   
Everything that sustains it: the dead leaves 
Of winter; the new leaves of spring which summer burns   
Into different kinds of happiness; for these,   
When autumn drops its tear upon them, turn. 


       3. Domes 

"Pleased in proportion to the truth 
Depicted by means of familiar images. That 
One was dazed; the other I left in a forest   
Surrounded by giant, sobering pines.   
For I had to abandon those lives.   
Their burden of living had become   
Mine and it was like dying: alone, 
Huddled under the cold blue dome of the stars, 
Still fighting what died and so close to myself I could not even see.   
I kept trying to look at myself. It was like looking into the sun and I went blind. 

O, to break open that inert light 
Like a stone and let the vision slowly sink down 
Into the texture of things, like a comb flowing through dark,   
Heavy hair; and to continue to be affected much later.   
I was getting so tired of that excuse: refusing love 
Until it might become so closely mated to its birth in   
Acts and words of love; until a soft monstrosity of song 
Might fuse these moments of affection with a dream of home;   
The cold, prolonged proximity of God long after night   
Has come and only starlight trickles through the dome; 

And yet I only wanted to be happy. 
I wanted rest and innocence; a place 
Where I could hide each secret fear by blessing it, 
By letting it survive inside those faces I could never understand,   
Love, or bear to leave. Because I wanted peace, bruised with prayer   
I tried to crawl inside the heavy, slaughtered hands of love 
And never move. And then I felt the wound unfold inside me   
Like a stab of paradise: explode: and then at last 
Exhausted, heal into pain. And that was happiness: 
A dream whose ending never ends, a vein 

Of blood, a hollow entity 
Consumed by consummation, bleeding so. 
In the sky our eyes ascend to as they sweep 
Upwards into emptiness, the angels sing their listless   
Lullabies and children wake up glistening with screams 
They left asleep; and the dead are dead. The wounded worship death 
And live a little while in love; and then are gone. 
Inside the dome the stars assume the outlines of their lives:   
Until we know, until we come to recognize as ours, 
Those other lives that live within us as our own.





The Vegetables
 

The Artichoke 

She bore only the heart,   
Worked at the stem with her   
Fingers, pulling it to her,   
And into her, like a cord. 

She would sustain him,   
Would cover his heart.   
The hairy needles 
And the bigger leaves, 

These she licked into shape,   
Tipping each with its point.   
He is the mud-flower, 
The thorny hugger. 


The Asparagus 

She sent packs of great beasts to pass 
Over him, trailing belly-fur and dust,   
Bending their nostrils to his frail spear.   
This was to toughen him. For what?   
Stupidly, like a squirrel, standing up,   
Looking here and there, looking to all sides, 

He is cut down and taken away. 
She can smell him steaming, his crowns   
Already tender, his spine giving in. 
Now he is threatening to wither terribly,   
And slip from the water altogether, 
And billow through the kitchen like prayer. 


The Cauliflower 

Her words clot in his head. 
He presses himself to remember   
And feels the skin peel back, 
The skull bleach, crack, fall away. 

All that's left of him is the brain, 
Its tissue knotting up to shade him,   
The pain of its light pulsing 
How to move, how to move. 


Herbs 

Before fog leaves the scrub-oak 
Or the grasses of the downland, 
Take dragonwort under the black alder,   
Take cockspur grass and henbane,   
The belladonna, the deadly nightshade.   
Free them as you would a spider's web,   
Singing over them: Out, little wen, 
                            Out, little wen. 
Sing this into the mouth of the woman. 


Corn 

I am the corn quail.   
What I do is quick.   
You will know only   
The muffled clucking,   
The scurry, the first   
Shiver of feathers   
And I will be up,   
I will be in your 
Head with no way out,   
Wings beating at the   
Air behind your eyes. 


Celery 

The hope with   
water is that it 
will conceal nothing, 

that a clearness 
will follow upon it   
like the clearness   
after much rain, 

or the clearness   
where the air   
reaches to the river 
and touches it, 

where the rain   
falls from the trees   
into the river. 


Bell Pepper 

To find enough rooms for the gathering   
The walls go on alone not waiting   
For corners but thinking of sleeves 
And how the wind fills them and the snow   
Fills them and how cold it is without   
Fires when there are not enough rooms. 


Potatoes 

It had been growing in her like vegetables.   
She was going into the ground where it could   
Do better, where she could have potatoes. 

They would be small and easily mistaken   
For stones. It would fall to her to   
Sort them out, persuade them to stay 

Close to her, comforting her, letting her   
Wear them on her body, in her hair,   
Helping her hold always very still.





The Magi
 

Now as at all times I can see in the mind's eye,   
In their stiff, painted clothes, the pale unsatisfied ones   
Appear and disappear in the blue depths of the sky   
With all their ancient faces like rain-beaten stones,   
And all their helms of silver hovering side by side,   
And all their eyes still fixed, hoping to find once more,   
Being by Calvary's turbulence unsatisfied,   
The uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor.





The Hero
 

Mortal and full of praise,
 I watch the enchanted hero busy at his chores:
 desert, tundra,
 prairie restless
 under an easy stride.
  
 Dagger in belt, sword
 slapping thigh, he passes
 from sight, the restored land
 sprung airily
 to green praise.
  
     Arachnid webs entangle life.
     A busyness of thread
     weaves silk into night--
     the long shudder of moonlight,
     a transfixed eye shuddering.
  
     Nothing is so easy as death, I try to say.
  
     But the hard fact of glazed eyes, the boy turned to
         solitude, lies
     face up in the center of all webs, roads
     unwinding stubble.
                                      Whoever is alone
     walks brittle filaments, late
     stars smudged on dawn, a night sky's frayed
     dawn.
               Dare we evaluate life:
     This hero's gesture charms eternity?
  
 Someone who paused here once on an ordinary day,
 troubled by the impatience of his calling,
 set up a hasty signpost:
 "Toward
  
     Nothing is so scarred
     as this place, shards of parched
     cloth trampled by footprints coiling
     crazed centers.
                              Fresh with spring, light breezes play
     on dust.
                       A whisper of rain. Ropes of skeined thunder
        twist sky.
  







Ladies
 

Agathas 

Four and forty lovers had Agathas in the old days,
All of whom she refused;

And now she turns to me seeking love,
And her hair also is turning.

Young Lady 

I have fed your lar with poppies,
I have adored you for three full years;
And now you grumble because your dress does not fit
And because I happen to say so.

Lesbia Illa 

Memnon, Memnon, that lady
Who used to walk about amongst us
With such gracious uncertainty,
Is now wedded
To a British householder.
Lugete, Veneres! Lugete, Cupidinesque! 

Passing 

Flawless as Aphrodite,
Thoroughly beautiful,
Brainless,
The faint odor of your patchouli,
Faint, almost, as the lines of cruelty about your chin,
Assails me, and concerns me almost as little.





To D-, Dead by Her Own Hand
 

My dear, I wonder if before the end 
You ever thought about a children's game-- 
I'm sure you must have played it too--in which   
You ran along a narrow garden wall   
Pretending it to be a mountain ledge   
So steep a snowy darkness fell away   
On either side to deeps invisible; 
And when you felt your balance being lost 
You jumped because you feared to fall, and thought   
For only an instant: That was when I died. 

That was a life ago. And now you've gone, 
Who would no longer play the grown-ups' game   
Where, balanced on the ledge above the dark,   
You go on running and you don't look down,   
Nor ever jump because you fear to fall.





Seaweeds
 

I know a little what it is like, once here at high tide   
Stranded, for them to be so attached to the bottom's   
Sarcophagus lids, up to their brown green gold wine   
Bottle necks in the prevailing booze, riding, as far   
As we can see, like a picnic on a blanket. 

Whatever plucks them from below the red horizon 
Like snapped pulleys and ropes for the pyramidal effort 
Of the moon, they come in, they come through the breakers,   
Heaps of hair, writing across the beach a collapsed   
Script, signers of a huge independence. 

Melville thought them pure, bitter, seeing the fog-sized   
Flies dancing stiff and renaissance above. But I   
Have eaten nori and dulse, and to have gone deep   
Before being cast out leaves hardly a taste of loneliness.   
And I take in their iodine.





Hymn to Life
 

The wind rests its cheek upon the ground and feels the cool damp   
And lifts its head with twigs and small dead blades of grass   
Pressed into it as you might at the beach rise up and brush away   
The sand. The day is cool and says, "I'm just staying overnight.   
The world is filled with music, and in between the music, silence   
And varying the silence all sorts of sounds, natural and man made:   
There goes a plane, some cars, geese that honk and, not here, but   
Not so far away, a scream so rending that to hear it is to be 
Never again the same. "Why, this is hell. Out of the death breeding   
Soil, here, rise emblems of innocence, snowdrops that struggle   
Easily into life and hang their white enamel heads toward the dirt   
And in the yellow grass are small wild crocuses from hills goats   
Have cropped to barrenness. The corms come by mail, are planted.   
Then do their thing: to live! To live! So natural and so hard   
Hard as it seems it must be for green spears to pierce the all but   
Frozen mold and insist that they too, like mouse-eared chickweed, 
Will live. The spears lengthen, the bud appears and spreads, its   
Seed capsule fattens and falls, the green turns yellowish and withers   
Stretched upon the ground. In Washington, magnolias were in bud. In   
Charlottesville early bulbs were up, brightening the muck. Tomorrow   
Will begin another spring. No one gets many, one at a time, like a long   
Awaited letter that one day comes. But it may not say what you hoped   
Or distraction robs it of what it once would have meant. Spring comes   
And the winter weather, here, may hold. It is arbitrary, like the plan   
Of Washington, D.C. Avenues and circles in asphalt web and no   
One gets younger: which is not, for the young, true, discovering new   
Freedoms at twenty, a relief not to be a teen-ager anymore. One of us   
Had piles, another water on the knee, a third a hernia--a strangulated   
Hernia is one of life's less pleasant bits of news--and only   
One, at twenty, moved easily through all the galleries to pill   
Free sleep. Oh, it's not all that bad. The sun shines on my hand   
And the myriad lines that criss-cross tell the story of nearly fifty 
Years. Sorry, it's too long to relate. Once, when I was young, I   
Awoke at first light and sitting in a rocking chair watched the sun   
Come up beyond the houses across the street. Another time I stood   
At the cables of a liner and watched the wake turning and   
Turning upon itself. Another time I woke up and in a bottle   
On a chest of drawers the thoughtful doctor had left my tonsils. I   
Didn't keep them. The turning of the globe is not so real to us   
As the seasons turning and the days that rise out of early gray   
--The world is all cut-outs then--and slip or step steadily down   
The slopes of our lives where the emotions and needs sprout. "I   
Need you, tree, that dominates this yard, thick-waisted, tall   
And crook branched. Its bark scales off like that which we forget:   
Pain, an introduction at a party, what precisely happened umpteen   
Years or days or hours ago. And that same blue jay returns, or perhaps   
It is another. All jays are one to me. But not the sun which seems at   
Each rising new, as though in the night it enacted death and rebirth,   
As flowers seem to. The roses this June will be different roses   
Even though you cut an armful and come in saying, "Here are the roses,   
As though the same blooms had come back, white freaked with red   
And heavily scented. Or a cut branch of pear blooms before its time,   
"Forced. Time brings us into bloom and we wait, busy, but wait   
For the unforced flow of words and intercourse and sleep and dreams   
In which the past seems to portend a future which is just more   
Daily life. The cat has a ripped ear. He fights, he fights all   
The tom cats all the time. There are blood gouts on a velvet seat.   
Easily sponged off: but these red drops on a book of Stifter's, will   
I remember and say at some future time, "Oh, yes, that was the day   
Hodge had a torn ear and bled on the card table? Poor 
Hodge, battered like an old car. Silence flows into my mind. It   
Is spring. It is also still really winter. Not a day when you say,   
"What a beautiful spring day. A day like twilight or evening when   
You think, "I meant to watch the sun set. And then comes on 
To rain. "You've got to take, says the man at the store, "the rough   
With the smooth. A window to the south is rough with raindrops   
That, caught in the screen, spell out untranslatable glyphs. A story   
Not told: so much not understood, a sight, an insight, and you pass on,   
Another day for each day is subjective and there is a totality of days   
As there are as many to live it. The day lives us and in exchange   
We it: after snowball time, a month, March, of fits and starts, winds,   
Rain, spring hints and wintry arrears. The weather pays its check,   
Like quarreling in a D.C. hotel, "I won't quarrel about it, but I made 
No local calls. Strange city, broad and desolating, monuments   
Rearing up and offices like monuments and crowds lined up to see 
The White House inside. "We went to see the White House.   It was lovely. 
Not so strange though as the cemetery with guttering flame and   
Admirals and generals with bigger gravestones than the lesser fry   
Below Lee's house, false marble pillars and inside all so 
Everyday, in every room a shawl tossed untidily upon a chair or bed   
Created no illusion of lived-in-ness. But the periwinkles do, in beds   
That flatten and are starred blue-violet, a retiring flower loved,   
It would seem, of the dead, so often found where they congregate. A   
Quote from Aeschylus: I forget. All, all is forgotten gradually and 
One wonders if these ideas that seem handed down are truly what they were? 
An idea may mutate like a plant, and what was once held basic truth   
Become an idle thought. like, "Shall we plant some periwinkles there 
By that bush? They're so to be depended on. The wind shakes the screen 
And all the raindrops on it streak and run in stems. It's colder. 
The crocuses close up. The snowdrops are brushed with mud. The sky   
Colors itself rosily behind gray-black and the rain falls through   
The basketball hoop on a garage, streaking its backboard with further   
Trails of rust, a lovely color to set with periwinkle violet-blue.   
And the trees shiver and shudder in the light rain blasts from off   
The ocean. The street wet reflects the breakup of the clouds   
On its face, driving over sky with a hissing sound. The car   
Slides slightly and in the west appear streaks of different green:   
A lid lifted briefly on the spring. Then the moon burns through   
Racing clouds, its aureole that of rings of oil on water in a harbor   
Bubbling up from an exhaust. Clear the sky. Beside a rim of moon.   
Three stars and only three and one planet. So under lilacs unleaved   
Lie a clump of snowdrops and one purple crocus. Purple. A polka-dotted   
Color little girls are fond of: "See my new dess! and she twirls   
On one foot. Then, crossed, bursts into tears. Smiles and rain, like   
These passing days in which buds swell, unseen as yet, waiting   
For the elms to color their further out most twigs, only the willow   
Gleams yellow. Life is hard. Some are strong, some weak, most   
Untested. These useless truths blow about the yard the day after   
Rain the soft sunlight making softer shadows on the faded lawn.   
The world looks so old in the spring, laid out under the sky. One   
Gull coasts by, unexpected as a kiss on the nape of the neck. These 
Days need birds and so they come, a flock of ducks, and a bunch of   
Small fluffy unnamed balls that hide in hedges and make a racket.   
"The gift of life, as though, existing in expectancy and then   
Someone came up and said, "Here, or, "Happy Birthday. It is more   
Mysterious than that, pierced by blue or running in the rain 
Or simply lying down to read. Writing a postponed letter which may   
Bring no pleasure: arduous truths to tell. And if you thought March was bad 
Consider April, early April, wet snow falling into blue squills   
That underneath a beech make an illusory lake, a haze of blue   
With depth to it. That is like pain, ordinary household pain, 
Like piles, or bumping against a hernia. All the signs are set for A OK 
A day to visit the National Gallery--Velzquez, Degas--but, and   
What a but, with water on the knee "You'll need a wheelchair, Mummy. 
Coasting among the masterpieces, of what use are they? Angel with a   
Hurdy-Gurdy or this young man in dun clothes who holds his hat so that   
The red lining shows and glows. And in the sitting room people sit   
And rest their feet and talk of where they've been, motels and Monticello,   
Dinner in the Fiji Room. Someone forgets a camera. Each day forgetting:   
What is there so striking to remember? The rain stops. April shines   
A little, stormily, the ocean off there makes its freight car noise   
Or rattles with catarrh and asks to have its nose wiped. Gray descends.   
An illuminous penetration of unbright light that seeps and coats   
The ragged lawn and spells out bare spots and winter fallen branches.   
Yardwork. And now the yardwork is over (it is never over), today's   
Stint anyway. Odd jobs, that stretch ahead, wide and mindless as   
Pennsylvania Avenue or the bridge to Arlington, crossed and recrossed   
And there the Lincoln Memorial crumbles. It looks so solid: it won't   
Last. The impermanence of permanence, is that all there is? To look   
And see the plane tree. Its crooked branches brush the ground, rear   
In its age, older than any of us, destined, if all goes well with it,   
To outlast us all. Does one then resent the plane tree, host   
To cardinals? I hear them call. Plaintively, in the mating season. 
Why should a white city dog my thoughts? Vast, arid, a home to many,   
So strange in its unamiability. Stony city laid out on an heroic plan,   
Why are you there? Various answers present themselves, likely   
As squills. It doesn't really matter, for instance, to miss the spring.   
For this is spring, this mud and swelling fruit tree buds, furred   
On the apple trees. And yet it still might snow: it's been known   
Falling like cherry blossom petals around the Reflecting Pool, a sight   
To see. And there are sights to hear, music from a phonograph, pop 
Or classical, please choose one or both. It doesn't matter. What matters   
Is how the light becomes entrapped in a dusty screen, masking out 
The view into the depths of the garage where the cars are stalled like oxen. 
Day, suddenly sunny and warming up for more, I would like to stroke you 
As one strokes a cat and feels the ridgy skull beneath the fur and tickles 
It behind its ears. The cat twists its head and moves it toward your fingers 
Like the lifting thighs of someone fucked, moving up to meet the stroke. 
The sun strokes all now in this zone, reaching in through windows to jell 
Glue in jars (that takes time)--may I send you a warmed bottle of Pliobond? 
It is on this desk and--here's the laugh--I don't know who put it there.   
"This is something he will like, or use. Meantime, those branches go 
Ungathered up. I hate fussing with nature and would like the world to be 
All weeds. I see it from the train, citybound, how the yuccas and chicory   
Thrive. So much messing about, why not leave the world alone? Then 
There would be no books, which is not to be borne. Willa Cather alone is worth 
The price of admission to the horrors of civilization. Let's make a list. 
The greatest paintings. Preferred orchestral conductors. Nostalgia singers. 
The best, the very best, roses. After learning all their names--Rose   
de Rescht, Cornelia, Pax--it is important to forget them. All these   
Lists are so much dirty laundry. Sort it out fast and send to laundry   
Or hurl into washing machine, add soap and let'er spin. The truth is   
That all these household tasks and daily work--up the street two men 
Install an air conditioner--are beautiful. Flowers and machines that people 
Love: the boy who opts for trade school while white collar kids 
Call him a greaser.' I wish I could take an engine apart and reassemble it. 
I also wish I sincerely wanted to. I don't. "Love is everything that it's 
Cracked up to be. There's a song for you. Another is in the silence   
Of a windless day. Hear it? Motors, yes, and the scrabbling of the surf   
But, too, the silence in which out of the muck arise violet leaves   
(Leaves of violets, that is). The days slide by and we feel we must   
Stamp an impression on them. It is quite other. They stamp us, both 
Time and season so that looking back there are wide unpeopled avenues   
Blue-gray with cars on them, parked either side, and a small bridge that   
Crosses Rock Creek has four bison at its corners, out of scale   
Yet so mysterious to childhood, friendly, ominous, pattable because   
Of bronze. The rain comes back, this spring, like a thirsty dog   
Who goes back and back to his dish. "Fill it up, please, wag wag.   
Gray depression and purple shadows, the daffodils feigning sunlight   
That came yesterday. One day rain, one day sun, the weather is stuck   
Like a record. Through it all the forsythia begins to bloom, brown   
And yellow and warm as lit gas jets, clinging like bees to 
The arching canes where starlings take cover from foraging cats. Not   
To know: what have these years of living and being lived taught us?   
Not to quarrel? Scarcely. You want to shoot pool, I want to go home:   
And just before the snap of temper one had sensed so 
Strongly the pleasure of watching a game well played: the cue ball   
Carom and the struck ball pocketed. Skill. And still the untutored   
Rain comes down. Open the laundry door. Press your face into the   
Wet April chill: a life mask. Attune yourself to what is happening   
Now, the little wet things, like washing up the lunch dishes. Bubbles   
Rise, rinse and it is done. Let the dishes air dry, the way 
You let your hair after a shampoo. All evaporates, water, time, the   
Happy moment and--harder to believe--the unhappy. Time on a bus, 
That passes, and the night with its burthen and gift of dreams. That   
Other life we live and need, filled with joys and terrors, threaded   
By dailiness: where the wished for sometimes happens, or, just   
Before waking tremulous hands undo buttons. Another day, the sun   
Comes out from behind unbuttoned cloud underclothes--gray with use-- 
And bud scales litter the sidewalks. A new shop is being built, 
An old one refurbished. What was a white interior will now be brown   
Behind men's clothes, there are these changes in taste. Fashion   
It anew. Change in everything yet none so great as the changes in   
Oneself, which, short of sickness, go unobserved. Why watch   
Yourself? You know you're here, and where tomorrow you will probably   
Be. In the delicatessen a woman made a fumbling gesture then   
Slowly folded toward the floor. "Get a doctor, someone said. "She's   
Having a fit. Not knowing how to help I left, taking with me   
The look of appeal in faded blue eyes. Between these sharp attacks   
Of harsh reality I would like to interpose: interpose is not the   
Word. One wants them not to happen, that's all, but, like slammed   
On brakes--the cab skids, you are thrown forward, ouch--they 
Come. Times when religion would help: "Be merciful "Intercede   
"That which I should have done ... Fear and superstition and some- 
Thing more. But without the conviction of a truth, best leave   
It alone. Life, it seems, explains nothing about itself. In the   
Garden now daffodils stand full unfolded and to see them is enough.   
They seem no more passing than when they weren't there: perhaps   
The promise when first the blades pierced the wintry soil   
Was better? You see, you invent choices where none exist. Perhaps   
It is not a choice but a preference? No, take it all, it's free,   
Help yourself. The sap rises. The trees leaf out and bloom. You   
Suddenly sense: you don't know what. An exhilaration that revives   
Old views and surges of energy or the pure pleasure of 
Simply looking. A car goes over a rise and there are birches snow   
Twisted into cabalistic shapes: The Devil's Notch; or Smuggler's   
Gap. At the time you could not have imagined the time when you   
Would forget the name, as apparent and there as your own. Rivers   
Reflecting silver skies, how many boys have swum in you? A rope   
Tied to a tree caught between my thighs and I was yanked headfirst   
And fell into the muddy creek. What a long time it seemed, rising   
To the surface, how lucky it didn't catch me in the groin. That   
Won't happen twice, I imagine. That summer sun was the same   
As this April one: is repetition boring? Or only inactivity? Quite   
A few things are boring, like the broad avenues of Washington   
D.C. that seem to go from nowhere and back again. Civil servants   
Wait at the crossing to cross to lunch at the Waffle House. In   
This twilight Degas a woman sits and holds a fan, it's 
The just rightness that counts. And how have you come to know just   
Rightness when you see it and what is the deep stirring that it   
Brings? Art is as mysterious as nature, as life, of which it is   
A flower. Under the hedges now the weedy strips grow bright   
With dandelions, just as good a flower as any other. Unfortunately,   
You can't pick them: they wilt. But these burgeoning days are   
Not like any others. Promise is a part of it, promise of warmth   
And vegetative growth. "Wheel me out into the sun, Sonny,   
These old bones that creak need it. And the gardener does not   
Come back: over the winter he had a heart attack, has to take it   
Easy. You see death shadowed out in another's life. The threat   
Is always there, even in balmy April sunshine. So what 
If it is hard to believe in? Stopping in the city while the light   
Is red, to think that all who stop with you too must stop, and   
Yet it is not less individual a fate for all that. "When I 
was born, death kissed me. I kissed it back. Meantime, there 
Is bridge, and solitaire, and phone calls and a door slams, someone   
Goes out into the April sun to take a spin as far as the   
Grocer's, to shop, and then come back. In the fullness of time, 
Let me hand you an empty cup, coffee stained. Or a small glass   
Of spirits: "Here's your ounce of whisky for today. Next door   
The boys dribble a basketball and practice shots. Two boys   
Run by: high spirits. The postman comes. No mail of interest.   
Another day, there is. A postcard of the Washington Monument,   
A friend waving from a small window at the needle top. "Hoo 
Hoo he calls. Another day, and still the sun shines down, warming   
Tulips into bloom, a redder red than blood. The dandelions   
Cringe before them. In the evening there will be time enough   
To drive from here to there, study the vegetable patch, admire   
The rosy violets. Life in action, life in repose, life in 
Contemplation, which is hard to tell from day dreaming, on a day   
When the sky woolgathers clouds and sets their semblance on a   
Glassy ocean. Only its edge goes lisp. On no two days the same.   
Is it the ocean's mindlessness that troubles? At times it seems   
Calculatedly malevolent, tearing the dunes asunder, tumbling   
Summer houses into itself, a terror to see. They say there are   
Those who have never felt terror. A slight creeping of the scalp,   
Merely. How fine. Finer than sand, that, on a day like this.   
Trickles through my fingers, ensconced in a dune cleft, sun   
Warmed and breeze cooled. This peace is full of sounds and   
Movement. A couple passes, jogging. A dog passes, barking   
And running. My nose runs, a little. Just a drip. Left over 
From winter. How long ago it seems! All spring and summer stretch   
Ahead, a roadway lined by roses and thunder. "It will be here   
Before you know it. These twigs will then have leafed and   
Shower down a harvest of yellow-brown. So far away, so   
Near at hand. The sand runs through my fingers. The yellow   
Daffodils have white corollas (sepals?). The crocuses are gone, 
I didn't see them go. They were here, now they're not. Instead 
The forsythia ensnarls its flames, cool fire, pendent above the smoke   
Of its brown branches. Beaches are near. It rains again: the screen 
And window glass are pebbled by it. It soaks through a rain coat that 
Has had its water repellency dry cleaned out of it. Most modern 
Inventions don't work so well, or not for long. A breakdown occurs, 
Or something simple, like the dishwasher detergent eating off 
The pattern on china, even the etched florets on wine glasses. 
Strong stuff. From the train, a stand of larch is greener than 
Greenest grass. A funny tree, of many moods, gold in autumn, naked 
In winter: an evergreen (it looks) that isn't. What kind of a tree 
Is that? I love to see it resurrect itself, the enfolded buttons 
Of needles studding the branches, then opening into little bursts. 
And that Washington flower, the pink magnolia tree, blooms now 
In little yards, its trunk a smoky gray. And soon the hybrid azaleas, 
So much too much, will follow, and the tender lilac. Persia, we 
Have much to thank you for, besides the word lapis lazuli. And someone   
You know well is suffering, sees it all but not the way before   
Him, hating his job and not knowing what to change it for. Have   
You any advice to give? Have you learned nothing in all these   
Years? "Take it as it comes. Sit still and listen: each so alone.   
Someone driving decides not to take that curve, to pile it up   
In smithereens, the anxious and unsatisfying years: goodbye, life.   
Others keep on living so as not to wound their friends: the suicide   
Fantasy, to awaken rested and fresh, to plunge into a deep and   
Dreamless sleep, to be mindless and at one with all that grows, 
Dies and revives each April, here, crying, "Stir your stumps!   
In the mental hospital a patient is ready to be discharged. "I'm   
So glad to be going home! Where the same old problems wait;   
Still, to feel more equal to them, that's something. "Time heals   
All wounds: now what's that supposed to mean? Wounds can   
Kill, like that horse chestnut tree with the rotting place will surely   
Die unless the tree doctor comes. Cut out the rot, fill with tree   
Cement, score and leave to heal. The rain comes down in buckets:   
I've never seen that, though you often speak of it. The rain   
Comes down and brings depression, too much and too often. And there   
Is the fog off the cold Atlantic. No one is at his best with   
A sinus headache. It will pass. Stopped passages unblock: why   
Let the lovely spring, its muck and scarlet emperors, get you   
Down. Unhibernate. Let the rain soak your hair, run down your   
Face, hang in drops from facial protuberances. Face into   
It, then towel dry. Then another day brings back the sun and   
Violets in the grass. The pear tree thickens all its boughs and   
Twigs into silver-white, a dimmed brilliance, and already at   
Its base a circle of petals on the unmowed grass. Far away   
In Washington, at the Reflecting Pool, the Japanese cherries   
Bust out into their dog mouth pink. Visitors gasp. The sun   
Drips, coats and smears, all that spring yellow under unending   
Blue. Only the oaks hold back their leaf buds, reticent. 
Reticence is not a bad quality, though it may lead to misunderstandings.   
I misunderstood silence for disapproval, see now it was 
Sympathy. Thank you, May, for these warm stirrings. Life 
Goes on, it seems, though in all sorts of places--nursing 
Homes--it is drawing to a close. Abstractions and generalities:   
Grass and blue depths into which the evening star seems set. 
As windows are set in walls in whited Washington. City, begone 
From my thoughts: childhood was not all that gay. Nor all that gray, 
For the matter of that. May leans in my window, offering hornets.   
To them too I give leave to go about their business, which is not   
Nesting in my books. The fresh mown lawn is a rug underneath   
Which is swept the dirt, the living dirt out of which our nurture   
Comes, to which we go, not knowing if we hasten or we tarry. May   
Opens wide her bluest eyes and speaks in bird tongues and a   
Chain saw. The blighted elms come down. Already maple saplings,   
Where other elms once grew and whelmed, count as young trees. In   
A dishpan the soap powder dissolves under a turned on faucet and   
Makes foam, just like the waves that crash ashore at the foot   
Of the street. A restless surface. Chewing, and spitting sand and   
Small white pebbles, clam shells with a sheen or chalky white.   
A horseshoe crab: primeval. And all this without thought, this   
Churning energy. Energy! The sun sucks up the dew; the day is   
Clear; a bird shits on my window ledge. Rain will wash it off   
Or a storm will chip it loose. Life, I do not understand. The   
Days tick by, each so unique, each so alike: what is that chatter   
In the grass? May is not a flowering month so much as shades   
Of green, yellow-green, blue-green, or emerald or dusted like   
The lilac leaves. The lilac trusses stand in bud. A cardinal   
Passes like a flying tulip, alights and nails the green day   
Down. One flame in a fire of sea-soaked, copper-fed wood:   
A red that leaps from green and holds it there. Reluctantly   
The plane tree, always late, as though from age, opens up and   
Hangs its seed balls out. The apples flower. The pear is past.   
Winter is suddenly so far away, behind, ahead. From the train   
A stand of coarse grass in fuzzy flower. Is it for miracles   
We live? I like it when the morning sun lights up my room   
Like a yellow jelly bean, an inner glow. May mutters, "Why 
Ask questions? or, "What are the questions you wish to ask?





The Very Rich Hours
 

Amant in bed,   
      dreaming. 
      There are no   
      borders to this   
      miniature. 

B moves Bateau across the night.   
It is all the loops can do 
to let their gilding 
bulge with what is there. 
One light on the wide sea. 
The bones of stars. 

      No other country is so 
      curiously watered. 
      From the estuaries to the very 
      sources of its inwardtending channels,   
      it rises in fogs which are themselves   
      arterial. For its earth 
      has more than once been seen 
      quite early in the morning 
      to lighten and give way. 

At the gate to the garden,   
Fair Welcome.   
She raises her hand. 
Salutare: 
to greet and to save. 

      Leisures of tendrils are on all sides,   
      winding with the snails 
      through white acanthus and discarded   
      badges of pilgrims. 
      You may assign to the nineteen 
      portholes in these borders 
      whatever you like. 

The sand is of such fineness 
and the flow so singly clear 
that nothing seems to pass through,   
golden, and with all its lights. 

      Water makes very much the best 
      portable horizon. 
      While its reflections are 
      fainter than those in the speculum,   
      their angles may be measured 
      accurately 
      and the differences from a true meridian   
      reckoned by the clock. 
      These sightings should be taken at least   
      three hours 
      before and after noon. 

Two liveried falconers, 
the jesses and bells, the gloves.   
Amant with the dove's neck-ring,   
The lady in her chamber. 
Winter trees, rooks in the white   
branches, hounds, the dying boar. 
On the top of a mountain   
a lion waving his tail. 

      The general course of the river   
      straightens, and is moderately timbered.   
      Scattered islands covered w/willow. 
      Across from a single, long bluff of open rock,   
      the plain to the S. is higher, extending   
      quite to the mountains which contain still   
      great quantities of snow. 
      A small creek falls in from this side.   
      Pursued its bottom for perhaps 4 m.   
      Cottonwood. Much evidence of beaver. 

Now all of this is to be understood   
in a spiritual manner. 
Let us cover 
the nakedness of our fathers   
with the cloak of a 
favorable interpretation. 

      Under a dry stalk of burdock, iron-brown   
      latches and fittings, a few nails. 
      The bulls are eating apples. 
      Thick grasses sweat through the whole pasture. 

Dame Reason with her 
chaplet of apothegms. 
He should put his heart 
in a single place only. 
The truest things about bodies   
are their shadows. 

      Pleas put me back   
      in the water I am 
      Paddle-to-the-Sea 

She has done this before.   
She wades into the current 
to the one point where the current 
lounges at her hips. 
She stands there. 
With all the time in the world,   
steadily, she kneels steadily 
deeper, to her shoulders, smiling, her hair 
cupped in both hands behind her neck. 

      The Familiar gives Its first   
      lesson to the lover. 
      A new order 
      is one that is renewed 
      hourly. 

A drove of geese in its tall, while file   
plucks home through the wet fallow.   
Hedges darken between the fields.   
Along the wolds for miles in level tracts,   
haze from the lime-kilns. 
All quarters of the sky are wintry, huge. 

      We could no longer be sure 
      that we had passed the Prveranges.   
      Freshets from the little stream   
      poured onto the lane, filling 
      ruts and drainages. In the dusk,   
      and with our shoes soaked, we set   
      off through a meadow, and another,   
      and found soon an abandoned   
      cottage of some old forester. 
      We determined that I should 
      stay and secure it as an outpost.   
      Meaulnes went on alone. 

At an earlier hour, 
the ground at the wood's edge   
illumines to some thousand   
footcandles, fades under the   
canopies, the layers 
of trees, of shrubs and herbs,   
under the dark itself, 
brighter by as many 
eyes as are buried there. 

      Tied to a washboard,   
      submerged, 
      the panes of glass 
      chime like clean ice. 

they are dangers harebells and   
just where the fall goes over   
they lean into the spray so   
far and bob so on their stems   
they thrill and a hammer rings   
carillon down the cows spine   
feel it there it goes again 

      Death hath its seat 
      close to the entrance of delight.   
                         --Gudique 

Sifting over porches and limp hibiscus,   
rust from the canvas awnings, 
its red spores dull in a moon that shows   
everything, houses and driveways,   
fishponds, all of them 
hiding from their insides, forgetting,   
looking around. 

      there is no way to lie down   
      and not lie in the same way   
      that someone has had to lie   
      thinking of how far it is 
      to the places no one goes   
      or to any place this far 
      from the beds where the dying   
      cry into the night this far 

Deacons and presbyters. 
The Laying On of Hands.   
In a vial, 
juice from the wild cucumber,   
powdered glass, 
the divine Endura.





Triolet
 

She was in love with the same danger   
everybody is. Dangerous 
as it is to love a stranger, 
she was in love. With that same danger   
an adulteress risks a husband's anger.   
Stealthily death enters a house:   
she was in love with that danger.   
Everybody is dangerous.





A Posthumous Poetics
 

From embarrassment, I made statements. 
My icons--tight caves and mouths--stuck together   
briefly like dry lips, like a lover's insults. 
The fact is they were ugly to all of us. 
I said, How painstakingly personal! 
Here are the words for this, 
Relentless as insects! I was hysterical. 

Every tone became artful, 
the worst urges nuzzling like housepets 
for someone to feel them, each real subject   
demanding more real context for remarks.   
Then abstractions insinuating their sharp edges,   
asking to pry open privacies 
alone in the bathroom at bedtime 
then with strangers in elevators, at stop signs.   
Even then, I knew you'd shun them, 
because who would choose such intrusions? 

I learned to love this isolation 
as a woman who appears to listen.   
All night I'd talk about my life   
anticipating her dramatic relief, 
believing her affectionate gestures filled in   
what wasn't spoken. At those times   
she seemed so genuine and friendly,   
a voice from inside my own body   
describing my shameless surrender   
as our first kiss, perfect as gravity. 






Phases
 

I. 
There's a little square in Paris, 
Waiting until we pass. 
They sit idly there, 
They sip the glass. 

There's a cab-horse at the corner, 
There's rain. The season grieves. 
It was silver once, 
And green with leaves. 

There's a parrot in a window, 
Will see us on parade, 
Hear the loud drums roll-- 
And serenade. 


                           II. 
This was the salty taste of glory, 
That it was not 
Like Agamemnon's story. 
Only, an eyeball in the mud, 
And Hopkins, 
Flat and pale and gory! 


                           III. 
But the bugles, in the night, 
Were wings that bore 
To where our comfort was; 

Arabesques of candle beams, 
Winding 
Through our heavy dreams; 

Winds that blew 
Where the bending iris grew; 

Birds of intermitted bliss, 
Singing in the night's abyss; 

Vines with yellow fruit, 
That fell 
Along the walls 
That bordered Hell. 


                           IV. 
Death's nobility again 
Beautified the simplest men. 
Fallen Winkle felt the pride 
Of Agamemnon 
When he died. 

What could London's 
Work and waste 
Give him-- 
To that salty, sacrificial taste? 

What could London's 
Sorrow bring-- 
To that short, triumphant sting?





Pig Song
 

This is what you changed me to:   
a greypink vegetable with slug 
eyes, buttock 
incarnate, spreading like a slow turnip, 

a skin you stuff so you may feed 
in your turn, a stinking wart 
of flesh, a large tuber 
of blood which munches 
and bloats. Very well then. Meanwhile 

I have the sky, which is only half   
caged, I have my weed corners,   
I keep myself busy, singing 
my song of roots and noses, 

my song of dung. Madame, 
this song offends you, these grunts   
which you find oppressively sexual,   
mistaking simple greed for lust. 

I am yours. If you feed me garbage,   
I will sing a song of garbage.   
This is a hymn.





Rat Song
 

When you hear me singing 
you get the rifle down 
and the flashlight, aiming for my brain,   
but you always miss 

and when you set out the poison   
I piss on it 
to warn the others. 

You think: That one's too clever,   
she's dangerous, because 
I don't stick around to be slaughtered   
and you think I'm ugly too 
despite my fur and pretty teeth   
and my six nipples and snake tail.   
All I want is love, you stupid   
humanist. See if you can. 

Right, I'm a parasite, I live off your   
leavings, gristle and rancid fat,   
I take without asking 
and make nests in your cupboards   
out of your suits and underwear.   
You'd do the same if you could, 

if you could afford to share   
my crystal hatreds. 
It's your throat I want, my mate   
trapped in your throat. 
Though you try to drown him   
with your greasy person voice, 
he is hiding / between your syllables   
I can hear him singing.





Siren Song
 

This is the one song everyone 
would like to learn: the song 
that is irresistible:

the song that forces men
to leap overboard in squadrons
even though they see the beached skulls

the song nobody knows
because anyone who has heard it
is dead, and the others can't remember.

Shall I tell you the secret 
and if I do, will you get me 
out of this bird suit?

I don't enjoy it here 
squatting on this island
looking picturesque and mythical

with these two feathery maniacs, 
I don't enjoy singing 
this trio, fatal and valuable.

I will tell the secret to you, 
to you, only to you. 
Come closer. This song

is a cry for help: Help me! 
Only you, only you can, 
you are unique

at last. Alas
it is a boring song
but it works every time.





Vowel Movements
 

Take a statement, the same as yesterday's dictation: 
         Lately pain has been there waiting when I awake.   
Creative despair and failure have made their patient. 
         Anyway, I'm afraid I have nothing to say. 
Those crazy phrases I desecrated the paper 
         With against the grain ... Taste has turned away her face   
Temporarily, like a hasty, ill-paid waitress 
         At table, barely capable but very vague. 
Mistaken praise and blame degrade profane and sacred 
         Places so strange you may not even know their names.   
Vacant the gymnasium where words once played naked 
         Amazing games that always used to end in mate. 

Better, then, the effort than preterite perfection,   
         I guess. Indeed, I envy the eminent dead   
The special effects I am ready to inherit 
         Less than their sentiments and impenitent sense   
Of aesthetic gesture. Unpleasant and pretentious, 
         The Western hemisphere has plenty to forget. 
The mess men might yet make of themselves, given present 
         Events! Are many content to accept the best?   
Precious as sex is, flesh, perenially wretched, 
         Begs the bread of heaven, blessing nevertheless   
The unexpected sender's address on a letter. 
         Every breathless sentence says not yet to death. 

The past cannot matter except as an abstraction, 
         A flattering caricature of happy lands   
Wherein many a grand, imaginary castle 
         In fact turns out to be a tourist trap at last,   
A vast palace that adrastic phantoms inhabit. 
         Maps of madness, characteristically blank,   
Ask vatic questions, exact a magic answer: 
         The family photograph album at a glance, 
Granny, Dad, Aunt Sally, that dissatisfied madame 
         Who manages passion's incalculable acts,   
Paris, everyman's romantic trash and tarry-- 
         Abracadabra, and the vanished cast comes back! 

If civilization isn't a silly gimmick, 
         Is it the wit to wish, the will to make it stick?   
The mathematical vision which built this system 
         Figures the width of a minute within an inch.   
Primitive physics, a sophisticated fiction, 
         Insists that in principle everything is fixed.   
Visitors picnic amid pretty Chichn Itz 
         With its sacrificial pit, artificial hills 
And cricket pitch wherein the winner is the victim.   
         To think an instinct like iniquity exists!   
Hidden riches fill big individual middens; 
         In the Wizard's Pyramid little lizards live. 

Specious sweets we reach for eagerly with Eve's evil 
         Greed recede like the fleeting details of a dream.   
It seems that we have been a brief season in Eden: 
         Chic unreal estates where immediately green   
Trees repeated in completely meaningless series 
         Briefly yield to the weaker tyranny of weeds   
Even as we seek relief in a secret clearing. 
         Prehistory can be too recent; need we read 
These steles' queried speech? Here undefeated peoples 
         Experienced deceit; here scenes of deepest grief   
Teach us to weep the cheap and easy tears of reason; 
         Here the sea of being sleeps, a period peace. 

Frustration, fuss, and lust are love's unlucky colours. 
         Thunderstruck, the muscular monuments look dumb.   
Judged by the numbers that once flourished in the jungle 
         In hundreds of miles of dull undercover scrub,   
Unless somebody was insufferably ugly 
         Mistrust of one another must be in the blood.   
Unsuccess in a dozen tough struggles instructs us   
         Justice is a mother-fucker. Suffering's fun 
For a month, but in a millenium no wonder 
         One becomes somewhat disgusted. Unsubtle skull,   
The mysteries of dust are nothing to live up to.   
         Insulted by a touch, one mutters, "Summer sucks. 

Undone by the siesta and by sudden showers, 
         Is it uncomfortable in the hungry South?   
Now cowed by Kulkulkan's geometrical scowl, 
         Now wowed by the classic brown faces in a crowd,   
You falter at mounds memorial to a thousand 
         Bleeding hearts in a single holiday cut out,   
Submitted to the sun, insatiable flesh-flower 
         Of the universe, all-devouring powerhouse, 
Confounded by our sound of pronounceable vowels. 
         Myths, as the guidebook says, are handed down by mouth.   
Though mood and voice and person, gender, tense, and number 
         Predicate a verb, its cases explain a noun: 

Proper noun or pronoun, indubitably human, 
         Whose beautiful excuse is usually youth   
Doomed to the brutal usufructu of the future, 
         Consumed by the illusions of jejune amours. 
You used to choose the rules with superfluous humour, 
         Tuned to the influential movements of the moon 
Whose smooth, translucent route through roofless rooms illumines 
         From dewy moonrise unto lunar afternoon   
Tulum and its improvements, tumulus and ruins, 
         Poorly reproduced, a too crudely stupid view. 
Who knew nude truth from rumour, amusement from music 
         Soon would prove a fool. Beauty, useless, is a wound. 

On and off; the impossible is honour's motto, 
         Monotony the awful drawback of my song. 
What was lost was often all we had got in common, 
         Our quasi-comic quandary depended on   
Qu'en dirai-je? chronic, colossal hypochondry, 
         Neurotic complication or hypnotic calm. 
Gods begotten of loss, not bronze nor terra cotta, 
         Haunt the province of law, of cause and conscious wrong.   
Following the Long Count a lot has been forgotten: 
         Positive nonsense, fraud, false plots and hollow talk,   
Soporific concepts toppled by fall or conquest, 
         The cosmos as a model watch that wants to stop. 

At any moment the doors of the soul may open 
         And those reproachful ghosts invoked from the remote   
Coasts of tomorrow begin to impose the order 
         Of bone and trophy, home and the odour of smoke.   
O mornings that broke on the slopes of cold volcanos, 
         Almost frozen, golden and old-rose, like a scroll   
Slowly unfolded, or a brocade robe thrown over 
         The throne of the mountains, cloaking their cones in snow!   
Hope, an emotion swollen by every omen, 
         No psychotrope, only a semiprecious stone,   
Topaz or opal, adorns the close of the strophe. 
         Woe wrote these notes in a code also known as prose. 

Ode: this leafy, streamless land where coy waters loiter 
         Under the embroidered soil, subterfluous coin   
Of another culture destroyed by lack of moisture, 
         Spoiled by the unavoidable poison of choice.   
Archaeological lawyers exploit the foibles 
         Of a royalty that in time joined hoi polloi: 
History's unemployed, geography's anointed, 
         Unlike the orchids of the forests, spin and toil.   
Imperfectly convinced of final disappointment,   
         Persuaded of the possibility of joy, 
Pen poised for the pointless impressions of those voices   
         That boil up like bubbles on the face of the void, 

Finally I try to define why divine silence 
         Underlies the tidy designs of paradise. 
Priceless as the insights of the inspired psyche, 
         Blind, violent as a geyser, right as a rhyme,   
Fine ideas likely to undermine the idle 
         Mind divided between the types of fire and ice,   
"Highly stylized politely describes the bright eyesores 
         Shining like diamonds or rhinestones in the night sky,   
Lifelike, provided life survives its vital cycle 
         And the tireless indictment of time's diatribe, 
While mankind, sightless, frightened, like a child in twilight, 
         Dies of the devices it was enlightened by. 

         Amazing games that always used to end in mate!   
Precious as sex is, flesh, perennially wretched, 
         In fact turns out to be a tourist trap at last.   
The mathematical vision which built this system 
         Of the universe, all-devouring powerhouse,   
(The mysteries of dust are nothing to live up to!) 
         Briefly yields to the weaker tyranny of weeds. 
You used to choose the rules with superfluous humour: 
         Monotony, the awful drawback of my song,   
Slowly unfolded, like a brocade robe thrown over. 
         Persuaded of the possibility of joy, 
Finally I tried to define why divine silence ...





Salvage
 

The wreck   
is a fact.   
The worst   
has happened.   
The salvage trucks   
back in and   
the salvage men   
begin to sort   
and stack,   
whistling as   
they work.   
Thanks be   
to god--again--   
for extractable elements   
which are not   
carriers of pain,   
for this periodic   
table at which   
the self-taught   
salvagers disassemble   
the unthinkable   
to the unthought.





Song (Love has crept...)
 

Love has crept into her sealed heart
As a field bee, black and amber,
Breaks from the winter-cell, to clamber
Up the warm grass where the sunbeams start.

Love has crept into her summery eyes,
And a glint of colored sunshine brings
Such as his along the folded wings
Of the bee before he flies.

But I with my ruffling, impatient breath
Have loosened the wings of the wild young sprite;
He has opened them out in a reeling flight,
And down her words he hasteneth.

Love flies delighted in her voice:
The hum of his glittering, drunken wings
Sets quivering with music the little things
That she says, and her simple words rejoice.






A Hanging Screen
 

"In warm sunlight jade   
engenders smoke; poetry,   
like indigo mountain, 
keeps its distance; 

the light plays words   
and figures, stone's   
edge edged with air,   
green haze growing. 

Amused by butterflies,   
Chuang Tsu dreaming,   
the emperor's heart in 
spring, thoroughly transformed. 

Still, in pieces, the words   
rest so much apart.   
Risking my life I lean   
on dangerous railings. 


When the dream wakes   
to its own particulars,   
the strands scattered,   
loose hair on muslin, 

broken characters 
the reeds make, unmake-- 
vague    no reason 
bright    again    dark-- 

the sidewalk's fracturing,   
damp willow twig 
forked there as well 
locust seedpods: 

Autumn, then, and 
gourd music, the wind-- 
indistinct    no-stop 
break    again    join. 


Drifting between narrow   
bluffs, sharp bends 
enclose us, deep 
rain-cuts all around-- 

mountain pass, slant   
sunlight and snow line,   
the dream piazza 
gilded into a high valley; 

"haze, mist, Kuo Hsi   
interrupted, sluice- 
way wedged into 
a mountain like a keel; 

what was said by fire- 
light, the bandit in 
the yellow sombrero   
laughing at the window. 

Chill surprise of 
Chinese apples, glitter   
of the Pacific between   
buildings--caught in 

passing, an empty   
rowboat or Russian sealer   
riding at anchor, Magellan   
full sail in dusty curtains, 

casements groan like   
taut rigging, bright   
shore, the heat lines   
full of spice, breadfruit 

stretching to our hands;   
a new nourishment, this   
mission, or shaded rest-- 
Pitcairn, a century or more. 


I wanted to make this poem   
of silk, stretched tight 
and polished, an ink wash   
drifting ambiguous mountains, 

words gathered like momentary   
details, instances of wind 
and water among loose foliage,   
painting au plein air; that is 

alive and painting a surface   
of perpetual change, the eye's   
return always at odds with   
memory, however certain; 

the wind's warp in the cloth,   
pressing the brushstroke back   
full of squalls, relaxing 
the line out of reach.





Afternoons
 

Quick passage into   
memory and behind   
only blank spaces, 

blue stain on pink   
litmus or merely   
known so closely 

something falls away   
receding from touch,   
caught in the air 

your fingers move,   
agile water-fly   
padding the surface 

of what is seen   
even among these   
defractions, bent 

pencil or warps   
of a flat eye, 
the wide world circling.





Learning the Trees
 

Before you can learn the trees, you have to learn   
The language of the trees. That's done indoors,   
Out of a book, which now you think of it   
Is one of the transformations of a tree. 

The words themselves are a delight to learn,   
You might be in a foreign land of terms 
Like samara, capsule, drupe, legume and pome,   
Where bark is papery, plated, warty or smooth. 

But best of all are the words that shape the leaves-- 
Orbicular, cordate, cleft and reniform-- 
And their venation--palmate and parallel-- 
And tips--acute, truncate, auriculate. 

Sufficiently provided, you may now 
Go forth to the forests and the shady streets   
To see how the chaos of experience 
Answers to catalogue and category. 

Confusedly. The leaves of a single tree 
May differ among themselves more than they do   
From other species, so you have to find, 
All blandly says the book, "an average leaf. 

Example, the catalpa in the book 
Sprays out its leaves in whorls of three   
Around the stem; the one in front of you   
But rarely does, or somewhat, or almost; 

Maybe it's not catalpa? Dreadful doubt.   
It may be weeks before you see an elm   
Fanlike in form, a spruce that pyramids,   
A sweetgum spiring up in steeple shape. 

Still, pedetemtim as Lucretius says, 
Little by little, you do start to learn; 
And learn as well, maybe, what language does   
And how it does it, cutting across the world 

Not always at the joints, competing with   
Experience while cooperating with   
Experience, and keeping an obstinate   
Intransigence, uncanny, of its own. 

Think finally about the secret will   
Pretending obedience to Nature, but   
Invidiously distinguishing everywhere,   
Dividing up the world to conquer it, 

And think also how funny knowledge is:   
You may succeed in learning many trees   
And calling off their names as you go by, 
But their comprehensive silence stays the same.





Korean mums
 

beside me in this garden
are huge and daisy-like
(why not? are not 
oxeye daisies a chrysanthemum?),
shrubby and thick-stalked,
the leaves pointing up
the stems from which 
the flowers burst in
sunbursts. I love
this garden in all its moods,
even under its winter coat
of salt hay, or now,
in October, more than
half gone over: here 
a rose, there a clump
of aconite. This morning
one of the dogs killed
a barn owl. Bob saw
it happen, tried to
intervene. The airedale
snapped its neck and left
it lying. Now the bird 
lies buried by an apple
tree. Last evening 
from the table we saw 
the owl, huge in the dusk,
circling the field
on owl-silent wings. 
The first one ever seen
here: now it's gone,
a dream you just remember.

The dogs are barking. In
the studio music plays
and Bob and Darragh paint.
I sit scribbling in a little
notebook at a garden table,
too hot in a heavy shirt
in the mid-October sun
into which the Korean mums
all face. There is a 
dull book with me,
an apple core, cigarettes,
an ashtray. Behind me
the rue I gave Bob
flourishes. Light on leaves,
so much to see, and 
all I really see is that
owl, its bulk troubling
the twilight. I'll 
soon forget it: what
is there I have not forgot?
Or one day will forget:
this garden, the breeze
in stillness, even
the words, Korean mums.





The Pool
 

Are you alive? 
I touch you. 
You quiver like a sea-fish. 
I cover you with my net. 
What are you--banded one?





Garden
 

I 

You are clear 
O rose, cut in rock, 
hard as the descent of hail. 

I could scrape the colour   
from the petals 
like spilt dye from a rock. 

If I could break you   
I could break a tree. 

If I could stir 
I could break a tree-- 
I could break you. 


II 

O wind, rend open the heat,   
cut apart the heat,   
rend it to tatters. 

Fruit cannot drop   
through this thick air-- 
fruit cannot fall into heat 
that presses up and blunts 
the points of pears   
and rounds the grapes. 

Cut the heat-- 
plough through it, 
turning it on either side   
of your path.





Nineteen-Fourteen: Peace
 

Now, God be thanked who has matched us with his hour,
      And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping!
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,
      To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary;
      Leave the sick hearts that honor could not move,
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,
      And all the little emptiness of love!
Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,
      Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,
            Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there,
      But only agony, and that has ending;
            And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.





Nineteen-Fourteen: The Dead
 

Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!
      There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,
      But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.
These laid the world away; poured out the red
Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be
      Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,
      That men call age; and those who would have been,
Their sons, they gave, their immortality.

Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth,
      Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain,
Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,
      And paid his subjects with a royal wage;
And Nobleness walks in our ways again;
      And we have come into our heritage.





Nineteen-Fourteen: The Soldier
 

If I should die, think only this of me: 
      That there's some corner of a foreign field 
That is for ever England. There shall be 
      In that rich earth a richer dust concealed; 
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware, 
      Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam; 
A body of England's, breathing English air, 
      Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home. 

And think, this heart, all evil shed away, 
      A pulse in the eternal mind, no less 
            Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given; 
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day; 
      And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness, 
            In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.



Poetry Out Loud Note: In the print anthology, this poem is titled simply "The Soldier." The student may give either title during the recitation.





...Within, Into, Inside, Under, Within...
 

I
  
 Beginnings: a chrysalis improvisation
 in the wings, roles
 taking on flesh before a role begins
  
 as light begins in the elm,
 pushing the long elm branches into night,
 a ghost light pressing sky
  
 or actors, swollen with strange selves,
 distended to the edges of tight skin,
 a brightness under moth-wing fingertips.
  
 White arms stretch out toward truth.
 The stage is full of light.
 Your brightness gloves my skin.
  
  
 II
  
 Alice, grown huge, swollen to fit of the tunnels,
 tiny, unable to reach a gold key,
 knew what gardens were for--
  
 yet never knelt in tunnels of rough sunlight
 to will flamboyance from green buds.
 The swollen poppy twists within its cap,
  
 a pink invention wrestling light.
 How often I think of tunneling roots,
 curtains of roots, white ropes
  
 that stroked our hair when we entered tunnels.
 Here, we are rubbed on gold.
 This wedge of pink beginnings troubles gardens.
  
  
 III
  
 A robin listens to darkness.
 I think of worms, grubs, moles,
 the slow ballet of rootlets twisting down,
  
 of cave fish, blacksnakes,
 and, asleep at Nieux, the great black bulls
 that thunder on dark walls.
  
 When we wear another self,
 do our souls darken? On a bright stage,
 do we enter darkest places?
  
  
 IV
  
 There is darkness clinging to the undersides of leaves.
  
 For we are entering darkness. It skuffs along cave walls,
 stumbling and skuffing fingertips.
 At Mycenae, it is a heavy must,
 a musty heavy breath in the hundred-step cistern.
  
 They wait, dark passageways in old houses, their worn
 silence frayed under a blur
 of footsteps. Our stretched-out hands
 manipulate evasive cellar shadows.
  
 Within the garden, silence darkens windblown leaves.
  
  
 V
  
 Oh I think of Alice gone down, down
 under groundcover dreams,
 a man's tunneled night.
  
 Who are these actors? On dream stages, I forget
 lines. My tongue-tied
 silence foundering     Stage props
 mumble rigidities.        The audience
  
 I think of silences at Nieux,
 at Mycenae, the tourists
 gone, guides returned
 to wives, houses.
  
 And those silences of capricious light.
 The calex splits, an abrupt pink flame.
 Orpheus' torch descends and still descends through
     arias of reddest blossom.
 





Syringa
 

Orpheus liked the glad personal quality 
Of the things beneath the sky. Of course, Eurydice was a part   
Of this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends   
Rocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks   
Can't withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon   
To the other, almost ready to give up wholeness.   
Then Apollo quietly told him: "Leave it all on earth.   
Your lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to   
Follow, except a few birds of dusty feather, 
Not vivid performances of the past. But why not?   
All other things must change too. 
The seasons are no longer what they once were,   
But it is the nature of things to be seen only once, 
As they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along   
Somehow. That's where Orpheus made his mistake.   
Of course Eurydice vanished into the shade; 
She would have even if he hadn't turned around. 
No use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel   
Of recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to utter an intelligent 
Comment on the most thought-provoking element in its train.   
Only love stays on the brain, and something these people,   
These other ones, call life. Singing accurately 
So that the notes mount straight up out of the well of   
Dim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers   
Growing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulates   
The different weights of the things. 
                                                       But it isn't enough   
To just go on singing. Orpheus realized this 
And didn't mind so much about his reward being in heaven   
After the Bacchantes had torn him apart, driven   
Half out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them. 
Some say it was for his treatment of Eurydice. 
But probably the music had more to do with it, and   
The way music passes, emblematic 
Of life and how you cannot isolate a note of it 
And say it is good or bad. You must 
Wait till it's over. "The end crowns all, 
Meaning also that the "tableau 
Is wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example,   
Melt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure   
That stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting;   
It is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal,   
Over which an abstract action is laid out in blunt,   
Harsh strokes. And to ask more than this 
Is to become the tossing reeds of that slow, 
Powerful stream, the trailing grasses 
Playfully tugged at, but to participate in the action   
No more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky   
Electric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth   
Into a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses   
Have each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks,   
"I'm a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me,   
Though I can understand the language of birds, and   
The itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is fully apparent to me. 
Their jousting ends in music much 
As trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm   
And is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, day after day. 

But how late to be regretting all this, even 
Bearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late!   
To which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours,   
Replies that these are of course not regrets at all,   
Merely a careful, scholarly setting down of 
Unquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way. 
And no matter how all this disappeared,   
Or got where it was going, it is no longer   
Material for a poem. Its subject 
Matters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly   
While the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad   
Comet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward   
That the meaning, good or other, can never   
Become known. The singer thinks 
Constructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages   
Like a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away.   
The song is engulfed in an instant in blackness   
Which must in turn flood the whole continent   
With blackness, for it cannot see. The singer   
Must then pass out of sight, not even relieved   
Of the evil burthen of the words. Stellification   
Is for the few, and comes about much later   
When all record of these people and their lives   
Has disappeared into libraries, onto microfilm.   
A few are still interested in them. "But what about   
So-and-so? is still asked on occasion. But they lie   
Frozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorus 
Speaks of a totally different incident with a similar name   
In whose tale are hidden syllables 


Of what happened so long before that 
In some small town, one indifferent summer.





Venus Transiens
 

Tell me, 
Was Venus more beautiful 
Than you are, 
When she topped 
The crinkled waves, 
Drifting shoreward 
On her plaited shell? 
Was Botticelli's vision 
Fairer than mine; 
And were the painted rosebuds   
He tossed his lady 
Of better worth 
Than the words I blow about you 
To cover your too great loveliness   
As with a gauze 
Of misted silver? 

For me, 
You stand poised 
In the blue and buoyant air, 
Cinctured by bright winds, 
Treading the sunlight. 
And the waves which precede you   
Ripple and stir 
The sands at my feet. 






Walking the Dunes
 

In movies when the hero is about to die,   
He scatters a few phrases in a place like this,   
Hoping the words will come up again 
Immortal, or the grasses will reach out for him   
As now they do for us. 

Someone has planted a row of little trees   
To stop the wind. Instead they've learned   
To bend like the elect 
In one direction only; they know 
The sea will shatter them. 

Isn't it always like this? 
Something uncontrollable becomes the hero,   
Taking off its dress, the ice plants 
Sunburn from the center out 
So we can see that their deaths 

Of splendid rust and yellow are not ours, 
We are allowed again the glare 
Of the sand, the druid hills, 
The grasses brushing the legs, though 
Just to have felt it once would have been enough. 








The Drought
 

The clouds shouldered a path up the mountains 
East of Ocampo, and then descended,
Scraping their bellies gray on the cracked shingles of slate.

They entered the valley, and passed the roads that went 
Trackless, the houses blown open, their cellars creaking 
And lined with the bottles that held their breath for years.

They passed the fields where the trees dried thin as hat racks 
And the plow's tooth bit the earth for what endured.
But what continued were the wind that plucked the birds spineless

And the young who left with a few seeds in each pocket, 
Their belts tightened on the fifth notch of hunger--
Under the sky that deafened from listening for rain.





Hospital
 

  I. PULSE   Light over the Hudson recovers a Caribbean I have        never seen. We list islands: Molokai, Oahu, Kauai; St. Lucia,        Haiti. The surf folds tunnels of light while a hand folds over a wrist (tell-tale pulse), counting. The long tunnel is a wrist of blown spume.   It is like a dance, I think, this silence full of questions. Pulse-beat; pulse-beat.     Pulse.     Pulse.   I push my hair back into the memories of palm trees, brushing my hands and my  hair on the islands.     2. NIGHT MUSIC Garlic and sapphires in the mud...                                  T.S. Eliot   The window opens onto a fire escape. The Sausage Manufacturers' Chamber Group, scattered       among potted geraniums and dying petunias, plays Hindemith's Kleine Kammermusik. The oboist, his briefcase full of knockwurst and reeds, is suffering       from hiccups. The cheerful notes--hiccups on oboe--float in through       the window. Ralph turns in bed, a flailing arm upsetting the urinal. Perhaps he is awake.           A pale German shepherd       leaps through the window, over the bars of the hospital bed, and begins to lick       Ralph's feet. Why are Ralph's feet out of the covers? The dog looks       up, and says "Ralph, and walks up Ralph's stomach to stare in his eyes. "Where is your bone? Ralph says; but the dog curls up       under Ralph's left arm and falls asleep. "Why not? Ralph thinks. The musicians have departed, only a faint odor of garlic lingering on the windowsill. "I could call you Fritz, Ralph says to the sleeping dog, "or Cokie or maybe even Pepe. But I'll call you Ralph. This time the music comes through the window       without hiccups and without garlic.     3. THE INVENTIONS OF SLEEP   A telephone call begins on the television set: You are in a phone booth, headlights in the distance, behind you couples strolling in a park. We almost know         each other's names, and I think about children moving out of darkness into       patches of light then back into darkness. Their voices are a murmur under your soft voice.       "I'm tired now, you say; "I haven't been called before.   In Manitoba winter, in loose snow thrown up by the        Canadian Pacific, elk burrow down, their great antlers caught in the dining car lights. Their        heads turn to each other in snow, muzzles, flanks touching under the snow line.   If I am asleep, your voice is folded under my arm, and I whisper, "sleep well, watching the antlers turn       to each other in loose snow, the summer voices blurred by city traffic.     4. THE DARK, THE DREAM   At 11:15, I will follow the last corridor into darkness. At 10:30, when I had spoken to the darkness for the         first time, I had asked the darkness the names of all the corridors, calling your name into every closed          door. But tonight all of the doors are windows.            Hide and seek:                  Helen     George     Barbara     Tom     Sheryl          of patches of fog on an Irish lake,                 Roger watching swans vanish.           Muffie dancing       Jim climbing the switchback               trail into light.                   Margaret and Mike dealing the cards, Janet                    asleep.   Lights go on and off back of the windows: I call your        name at the head of each corridor.                 not windows. Vyvian hands me the negatives: ten seconds: Theone on the far side of the car:      four a.m., truth       balanced on a steering wheel; ten seconds: my mother's body falling toward darkness, the dead child falling, Bob Pawlowsky falling:        I         have no goodbye.     . . .   11:15: hide and seek, and the long corridor darkening         against night's invention echo lengthening. --my way now, calling.     5. SCARS   That little scar I'll never see on the left underside of my    heart or the almost-closed arteries opening and closing like    baby mouths or the good artery, a tiny flow talking about    tomorrow.   Strange in the garden, watching two boys wrestle in     long grass, their wheelchair friend in zebra-striped pajamas watching     the wrestling, all three in the hungry shade of a magnolia. Binoculars: The boy in striped pajamas' dense shouts: shouting,     shouting: "Quit it, you cocksuckers! They won't even let you     walk on the grass. Quit! They are hidden by the magnolia. I cannot hear them. The long magnolia branches wrestle like boys' white     arms and legs.   That scar in the groin: hernia. Punched hole in the     groin: heart catheter. The new scar throat to belly.   Now they have helped the zebra boy back into the      wheelchair and, pushing him up the hospital ramp, take turns     bumping shoulders. "Quit it you pricks! Do you want me thrown out of the    place?   I listen to my casual heart beating veins into arteries;     then I approach the zebra and his friends.   In Africa, wildebeest, impala, warthog gather at the      waterhold, nudging shoulders. The gaunt flat-topped trees cast lion shadows, vultures circling. Where are the sabre tooth tiger, the     mastodon?   I think of America cemented coast to coast, white     jet-trail scars for sky, a loveliness of footprints jumbled on spring grass.     6. POST-OPERATIVE (1)   Fever again: 101           slow footsteps on the beach. The footsteps are a conversation in the      waves. "Come. I'm here.    I am walking toward the     long-haired woman wrestling already her bright shoulders' turning. On the shore, gaunt lovers wrestle bone against bone, rib cages interlocked, bone grinding: slow footsteps           music on dry sand     7. POST OPERATIVE (2)   Joy crusted with pain:    fresh lava    breaking through    a shifting black map    in the crater pit:            Mauna Ulu: New Mountain.      Seabird, seabird, fly the old lava. In long light, at the foot of the pali, press in on the 40-foot spine, legs wrapping heads; arms, torso, genitals cradled in legs, a 40-foot snake, chain of love, birth chain, twisting in the long ocean light, an arm under the dark cloud brushing generations of lovers. Seabird, seabird, fly in on a long stroke of cold light.     8. POST-OPERATIVE (3): THE ELEVATOR   Elevator: a hand on my shoulder, a hand on the      wheelchair, hands brushing my hair or the blown hair of a woman shouldered in     sea-foam elk burrowing in loose snow or a mouth opening, closing       mouths meeting.   In one step, I am free, my feet firm. This is Manhattan, the cement island, below me the     Hudson roped in pale rain. Three boys break into a run, dodging taxis. Their jeans are tight wet skins, their wet faces masks. "Run fast! The towers of the hospital shape sky.   Haiti, Kauai, Manhattan--white shoulders of the sea    breaking down every island.   A little box on a chain goes up and down:      up     down.         Once, in a dream, the elevator reached top floor, then shifted sideways, finding another shaft; at basement, it returned to floor 1, returned to basement, floor 1, basement, then floor 10, floor 11--sideways on floor 11, doors opening into mouths.   A mouth in my heart says a name, calling. Then      another, another.   I brush dry sand from my arms that are streaming rain, turning toward Broadway. 





Fire: The People
 

Toplight hammered down by shadowless noon, 
A palindrome of midnight, retrograde
From last month's solstice in smoke and flame, 
In molten glares from chrome or glass. I feel 
Fever from the cars I pass, delirium
Trembling out from the radiators.
The dog-day romance seems to be physical, 
As young free lances come into their own, 
Sunbrowned, imperial in few clothes,
Heat-struck adulthood a subject to youth 
And fitful as traffic, the mind pure jumble 
But for that secret overriding voice
Advising and persuading at each crossroads; 
The struggle toward freedom to forge a day.

Smoke; flame; oiled, gray-brown air.
Jackhammers and first gear on the avenues; 
Stuntmen driving taxicabs; patient, blue, 
Hippo aggressiveness of a bus, nudging 
Aside the sedans. And the peculiar
Fascination of a row of workshops--
The dark interiors with skylight sunstripes; 
A figure walking in slow motion among 
Pistons; rough justice of a die cutter;
A helmeted diver, wielding acetylene,
Crouched over some work of sunken treasure 
That sparkles gold at a probe from his torch . . . . 
Seismic shocks interrupt this dream--a stampede 
Of transports flat out to make the light, 
Mack truck, Diamond Reo, a nameless tanker,
IT International, a Seatrain destined
For the Port Authority docks--one more 
Corrugated block to pile on the rest,
Red, green, gray, and blue, waiting for a ship 
In the Grancolombiana line . . . .
The seagoing city radiates invisibly
Over the world, a documentary sublime.

Lunch hour, even the foods are fast, potluck 
In the melting pot: the Italian girl
With a carton of chicken; Puerto Rican folding 
A pizza; the black woman with an egg roll; 
A crop-headed secretary in round,
Metal spectacles eats plain yogurt (she's 
Already mantis thin) and devours glamour 
Mags . . . . Our crowd scene, a moving fresco: 
But is it really there? The adversary
Today is named Random. How capture all this 
Without being taken captive in turn, 
Install it as something more than backdrop, 
As a necessity, not a sundry?
Suppose just an awareness of the way 
Living details might be felt as vision
Is vision, full, all there ever was--this 
Instant palindromic noon, the joined hands 
Of the clock, end and beginning . . . . Surely 
The first to consider imagining stars 
Constellations had already done as much, 
Just by making some brilliant connections;
Mind crowned itself in a round of leaps from point 
To point across the empty stage of night . . . .

* * * * *

Now as a pigeon banks, descends, hovers, 
And drops on asphalt with back-thrust wings, 
Comes a desire to be lifted in the balance, 
Rise to some highest point and then be met 
By a fierce new light haloing lashes shatter 
Into spears of aurora, naked eye become
Prismatic at last and given to see in kind
All the transformed inhabitants forever go
About their errands, on a new scale: the rainbow 
Is the emblem for this moment filtering through
The body's meshwork nerves, and a heartbeat impulse 
All around puts troops of feet in step with music, 
Persistent, availing, that disregards the frayed 
Years, vagaries, downfall among trash, accident, 
Loss; or because it knows these rushes upward 
On something like heartbreak into the only sky, 
Air aspirant with fractioned voices, feverfew 
Of the sensed illusion, higher ground, progressions 
Sounded in the spheres--so each step takes them further, 
Sceptered, into daytime, saluting the outcome. 
There is a fire that surpasses the known burning, 
Its phoenix center a couple that must be there, 
Blast furnace, dynamo, engendering a city, 
Phosphor spines that bend and meet to weld, to fuse 
As a divining rod--sluicings, spillway, braid, 
Chorded basses that set myriad threads afire, 
Newborn limbs and reach of the proven tendon now 
Let go into empowered brilliance, rayed showers, 
The garden regained. In this light the place appears: 
Hands that rise or fall, muted gestures of welcome 
And good-bye, face that turns and comes forward to claim 
A smile latent in the afternoon air, vague crowds 
Falling down streets without character toward 
An offered covenant--love that gives them each a name.






Elegy ("Who keeps the owls breath?)
 

If there is any dwelling place  for the spirits of the just; as the wise believe, noble souls  do not perish with the body,  rest thou in peace ...  --Tacitus
Who keeps the owl's breath? Whose eyes desire?   
Why do the stars rhyme? Where does 
The flush cargo sail? Why does the daybook close? 

So sleep and do not sleep. 

The opaque stroke lost across the mirror, 
The clamp turned. 
The polished nails begin the curl into your palms.   
The opal hammock of rain falls out of its cloud. 

I name you, Gloat-of- 
The-stalks, drowse-my-embers, old-lily-bum. 
No matter how well a man sucks praise in the end   
He sucks earth. Go ahead, step 
Out into that promised, rasp gratitude of night. 

Seeds and nerves. Seeds 

And nerves. I'll be waiting for you, in some   
Obscure and clarifying light; 
I will say, Look, there is a ghost ice on the land. 

If the page of marble bleeds in the yellow grass,   
If the moon-charts glow useless and cold, 
If the grains of the lamp outlast you, as they must--   
As the tide of black gloss, the marls, and nectar rise 

I will understand. 

Here are my gifts: smudges of bud, 
A blame of lime. Everything you remember crowds   
Away. Stubble memory, 
The wallpaper peeling its leaves. Fog. Fog 
In the attic; this pod of black milk. Anymore, 

Only a road like August approaches. 

Sometimes the drawers of the earth close;   
Sometimes our stories keep on and on. So listen-- 

Leave no address. Fold your clothes into a little   
Island. Kiss the hinges goodbye. Sand the fire. Bitch   
About time. Hymn away this reliquary fever. 

How the sun stands crossing itself in the cut glass. 

How the jonquils and bare orchards fill each morning   
In mist. The branches in the distance stiffen, 
Again. The city of stars pales. 
In my fires the cinders rise like black angels; 
The trunks of the olives twist once towards the world. 

Once. I will walk out into the day.





Sonnet in the Shape of a Potted Christmas Tree
 

O

fury-

bedecked!

O glitter-torn!

Let the wild wind erect

bonbonbonanzas; junipers affect

frostyfreeze turbans; iciclestuff adorn

all cuckolded creation in a madcap crown of horn!

It's a new day; no scapegrace of a sect

tidying up the ashtrays playing Daughter-in-Law Elect;

bells! bibelots! popsicle cigars! shatter the glassware! a son born

now

now

while ox and ass and infant lie

together as poor creatures will

and tears of her exertion still

cling in the spent girl's eye

and a great firework in the sky

drifts to the western hill.







Chiapas
 

There is the one who turns 
A spoon over like a letter, 
Reading the teeth-marks 
Older than his own;

The one who strikes a match, 
Its light flowering
In his eyes,
The smoke in his throat;

The one who opens the mouth 
Of a dog to listen
To the sea, white-tipped
And blind, feel its way to shore.

At night
They walk in the streets, 
The dust skirting their legs 
Raw with lice

And the wind funneled 
Through a doorway
Where someone might pray 
For a loaf of good luck.

               *

Somewhere the old follow 
Their canes down
A street where the front 
Pages of a newspaper

Scuttle faceless
And the three-legged dog hops home. 
A door is locked twice
And flies ladder a scale of fish.

Somewhere a window yellows 
From a lantern. A child
With fever, swabbed in oils 
And mint, his face

Spotted like an egg, 
His cry no different 
Than the cry
That shakes the trees lean.

A candle is lit for the dead 
Two worlds ahead of us all.





The Boarding
 

One of these days under the white   
clouds onto the white 
lines of the goddamn PED 
X-ING I shall be flattened, 
and I shall spill my bag of discount   
medicines upon the avenue, 
and an abruptly materializing bouquet   
of bums, retirees, and Mexican   
street-gangers will see all what   
kinds of diseases are enjoying me 
and what kind of underwear and my little   
old lady's legs spidery with veins.   
So Mr. Young and Lovely Negro Bus   
Driver I care exactly this: zero,   
that you see these things 
now as I fling my shopping 
up by your seat, putting 
this left-hand foot way up 
on the step so this dress rides up,   
grabbing this metal pole like 
a beam of silver falling down 
from Heaven to my aid, thank-you,   
hollering, "Watch det my medicine   
one second for me will you dolling, 
I'm four feet and det's a tall bus   
you got and it's hot and I got 
every disease they are making   
these days, my God, Jesus Christ,   
I'm telling you out of my soul.





Late Echo
 

Alone with our madness and favorite flower 
We see that there really is nothing left to write about. 
Or rather, it is necessary to write about the same old things 
In the same way, repeating the same things over and over 
For love to continue and be gradually different. 

Beehives and ants have to be re-examined eternally 
And the color of the day put in 
Hundreds of times and varied from summer to winter 
For it to get slowed down to the pace of an authentic 
Saraband and huddle there, alive and resting. 

Only then can the chronic inattention 
Of our lives drape itself around us, conciliatory 
And with one eye on those long tan plush shadows 
That speak so deeply into our unprepared knowledge 
Of ourselves, the talking engines of our day.





Waving Goodbye
 

I wanted to know what it was like before we 
had voices and before we had bare fingers and before we 
had minds to move us through our actions 
and tears to help us over our feelings, 
so I drove my daughter through the snow to meet her friend 
and filled her car with suitcases and hugged her 
as an animal would, pressing my forehead against her, 
walking in circles, moaning, touching her cheek, 
and turned my head after them as an animal would, 
watching helplessly as they drove over the ruts, 
her smiling face and her small hand just visible 
over the giant pillows and coat hangers 
as they made their turn into the empty highway.





Ode
 

People in the middle ages didn't think they were living
Between two more important and enlightened eras;
Nor did they see themselves as the players
In act three of a tragedy in five acts.
It was not always late winter in the middle ages.
People in the middle ages were not all middle-aged
Though it is enjoyable on occasion to assume that they were.
The sun was as bright in the dark ages
As it is now--maybe a fraction brighter, in fact.
 
Think of the middle ages and what do you see:
Gloomy cathedrals, students dressed like monks in the rain,
Or a band of drunken pilgrims telling obscene jokes,
Or heroes embarking for the nearest wilderness come April?
Your answer will reveal yourself to yourself
But you may not know it--may choose to hide
In hazy visions of a serene and indescribable paradise.
And paradise, as we all know, may be paradise when we're dead,
But is boredom on earth, alas.
 
We never think of ennui in relation to the middle ages.
Should we? Did Thomas Aquinas never get bored
Cooking up elaborate refutations of diminutive heresies?
No, and you shouldn't either. Nor did the clerks
of Oxford tire of the sin against the Holy Ghost,
Trying to figure out what it was.
 
On chill September mornings when
I smoked too much the night before
And I drank too much the night before
And a sinister cough rises up
From the depths of the belly of my being,
I like to imagine living in Provence
Or even in Rheims during the middle ages.
 





Its Like This
 

for Peter Parrish
Each morning the man rises from bed because the invisible 
      cord leading from his neck to someplace in the dark, 
      the cord that makes him always dissatisfied,
      has been wound tighter and tighter until he wakes.

He greets his family, looking for himself in their eyes, 
      but instead he sees shorter or taller men, men with 
      different degrees of anger or love, the kind of men 
      that people who hardly know him often mistake 
      for him, leaving a movie or running to catch a bus.

He has a job that he goes to. It could be at a bank
      or a library or turning a piece of flat land
      into a ditch. All day something that refuses to 
      show itself hovers at the corner of his eye, 
      like a name he is trying to remember, like 
      expecting a touch on the shoulder, as if someone 
      were about to embrace him, a woman in a blue dress 
      whom he has never met, would never meet again. 
      And it seems the purpose of each day's labor 
      is simply to bring this mystery to focus. He can 
      almost describe it, as if it were a figure at the edge 
      of a burning field with smoke swirling around it 
      like white curtains shot full of wind and light.

When he returns home, he studies the eyes of his family to see 
      what person he should be that evening. He wants to say: 
      All day I have been listening, all day I have felt
      I stood on the brink of something amazing.
      But he says nothing, and his family walks around him 
      as if he were a stick leaning against a wall.

Late in the evening the cord around his neck draws him to bed. 
      He is consoled by the coolness of sheets, pressure
      of blankets. He turns to the wall, and as water
      drains from a sink so his daily mind slips from him.
      Then sleep rises before him like a woman in a blue dress, 
      and darkness puts its arms around him, embracing him.
      Be true to me, it says, each night you belong to me more, 
      until at last I lift you up and wrap you within me.





Back Road
 

Winter mornings
driving past
I'd see these kids 
huddled like grouse
in the plowed ruts
in front of their shack 
waiting for the bus,
three small children 
bunched against the drifts 
rising behind them.

This morning
I slowed to wave 
and the smallest, 
a stick of a kid 
draped in a coat, 
grinned and raised 
his red, raw hand, 
the snowball 
packed with rock 
aimed at my face.







Brian Age Seven
 


Grateful for their tour
of the pharmacy,
the first-grade class
has drawn these pictures,
each self-portrait taped
to the window-glass,
faces wide to the street,
round and available,
with parallel lines for hair.
 
I like this one best: Brian,
whose attenuated name
fills a quarter of the frame,
stretched beside impossible
legs descending from the ball
of his torso, two long arms
springing from that same
central sphere. He breathes here,
 
on his page. It isn't craft
that makes this figure come alive;
Brian draws just balls and lines,
in wobbly crayon strokes.
Why do some marks
seem to thrill with life,
possess a portion
of the nervous energy
in their maker's hand?
 
That big curve of a smile
reaches nearly to the rim
of his face; he holds
a towering ice cream,
brown spheres teetering
on their cone,
a soda fountain gift
half the length of him
--as if it were the flag
 
of his own country held high
by the unadorned black line
of his arm. Such naked support
for so much delight! Artless boy,
he's found a system of beauty:
he shows us pleasure
and what pleasure resists.
The ice cream is delicious.
He's frail beside his relentless standard.

 





My Old Idols
 

I. AT TEN

   1955. A scratchy waltz
   Buzzed over the ice rink's P.A.
   My classmate Tony, the barber's son: "Alls
   He wantsa do is, you know, like, play.

   Bored with perfecting my languid figure eights,
   I trailed him to a basement door marked GENTS
   With its metal silhouette of high-laced skates
   (Symbols, I guess, of methods desire invents).

   Tony's older brother was waiting inside.
   I'd been "requested, it seemed. He was sixteen,
   Tall, rawboned, blue-eyed,
   Thumbs hooked into faded, tightening jeans.

   I fumbled with small talk, pretending to be shy.
   Looking past me, he slowly unzipped his fly.
 
 
II. CALLAS

   Her voice: steeped in a rancid syrupy phlegm:
   Whatever's not believed remains a grace
   While again she invokes the power that yields:
   Splintered timber and quick consuming flame:
   The simplest way to take hold of the heart's
   Complications, its pool of spilt religion:
   A long black hair sweat-stuck to the skin:
   The bitter sleep of the dying: the Jew in Berlin:
   Who sent you here? the sharp blade pleads:
   Stormcloud: thornhedge: starchill:
   Blood bubble floating to the top of the glass:
   The light, from fleshrise to soulset:
   The world dragging the slow weight of its shame
   Like the train of pomp: guttering candle: her voice.
 

III. IN CLASS

   Parasangs, satraps, the daily drill . . .
   Beginner's Greek its own touchstone.
   The sophomore teacher was Father Moan,
   Whom I longed to have praise my skill.
   The illustrated reader's best
   Accounts of murder and sacrifice
   Only suggested the heavy price
   I longed to pay at his behest.

   He'd slap the pointer against his thigh.
   I quivered. What coldness may construe
   Of devotion was an experience
   As hard to learn as catch his eye.
   I kept my hand up. Here! I knew
   The right answer. The case. The tense.





Lines On My Face
 

Decades now of looking back at it--
in some old satellite's rearview mirror, say--
has something to show beyond the folds and feeders,
the volumes of magma risen into native rock
or the buried flow of old fires cooling
in ocean beds. The damage has been memorized.
Tool marks left by loose doubts dragged
across a certainty. Tongues of river
sediment slumped but still flickering
in the eye. And how pale the surfaces are!

From miles above what even to others is familiar,
the erosion--tears that freeze and crack
the heart, small habits a wind blasts
against whatever's exposed--seems apparent:
all's worn down, weathered, notched, seeping,
yet eerily polished, as if at last defined.
Your map of me? Let your pencil trace
the old quarries and splintered outcrops,
let it analyze the faults, describe their throes,
let it reveal how the light is laid over them all.





Black Soap
 

1 
White lather on black soap-- 
Maria's gift. It reminds me   
Of when a woman died 
And they handed me her ring. 

Then they left to divide the roots for her.   
Daylight went down there shining. 
By accident, cleaning the hearth 
Of a house to leave it for good, 
I learned how to see 
A star come out: work 
My hand into the ashes. 

2 
"You've thrown a chestnut hull into the fireplace again,   
Said Colette's mother, "My clean ashes!   
Naughty Colette had soiled the washing ashes 
Of applewood, poplar, and elm.   
Stretched over the big cauldron 
In the washhouse, hemp cloth held the ashes 
The washwoman poured a jug of boiling water on. 
They smelled almost sweet as the lye   
Filtered into the mass of linen.   
The air darkened with blue clouds.   
In the smoking lava layer of ashes,   
A few cinders of chestnut hulls,   
The tannin's yellow stain. 

3 
Look for something 
You've been every day of your life.   
You said it was "lonely. 
I'm certain it is also "clean. 
My body's big years diminish soap. 
My grandmother, whose diamond it was,   
Had a stone in her tub. 
I rubbed it on my feet 
As later I walked, 
Building little hoofs, 
All summer shoeless on creek gravel. 

That black bar of stone 
In the widow's clean house,   
That volcanic pumice skips   
Over most hard places 
But softens at least one. 

4 
Once there was a downpour of rain   
They took as a judgment. 
It confused her billowing, steaming skirts.   
Another time--those times were hard-- 
The executioner let go the twisted hemp   
From her neck sooner than he should   
Because the flames reached his hands.   
Nor would I, if I'd had to live then,   
Put my hands into the fire 
Those three hours it took to reduce her.   
But after, I'd scrub all over 
With the ashes of the still warm 
Black heart of the witch.





Found Parable
 

In the men's room at the office today
some wag has labelled the two stalls
    the Erotic and the Political.
The second seems suitable for the results
of my business, not for what thinking
    ordinarily accompanies it.
So I've locked myself into the first because,
though farther from the lightbulb overhead,
    it remains the more conventional
and thereby illuminating choice.
The wit on its walls is more desperate.
    As if I had written them
there myself, but only because by now
I have seen them day after day,
    I know each boast, each plea,
the runty widower's resentments,
the phone number for good head.
    Today's fresh drawing:
a woman's torso, neck to outflung knees,
with breasts like targets and at her crotch
    red felt-tip "hair to guard
a treasure half wound, half wisecrack.
The first critic of the flesh is always
    the self-possessed sensualist.
With all that wall as his margin,
he had sniffed in smug ballpoint
    OBVIOUSLY DONE BY SOMEONE
WHO HAS NEVER SEEN THE REAL THING.
Under that, in a later hand,
    the local pinstripe aesthete
had dismissed the daydreamer's crudity
and its critic's edgy literalism.
    His block letters had squared,
not sloping shoulders: NO,
BY SOMEONE WHO JUST CAN'T DRAW.
    Were the two opinions
converging on the same moral point?
That a good drawing is the real thing?
    Or that the real thing
can be truly seen only through another's
eyes? But now that I trace it through
    other jokes and members,
the bottom line leads to a higher inch
of free space on the partition--
    a perch above the loose
remarks, like the pimp's doorway
or the Zen master's cliff-face ledge.
    THERE ARE NO REAL THINGS
writes the philosopher. But he too
has been misled by everything
    the mind makes of a body.
When the torso is fleshed out
and turns over in the artist's bed,
    when the sensualist sobs over her,
when the critic buttons his pants,
when the philosopher's scorn sinks back
    from a gratified ecstasy,
then it will be clear to each
in his own way. There is nothing
    we cannot possibly not know.





Late Night Ode
 

HORACE IV. i

It's over, love. Look at me pushing fifty now,
    Hair like grave-grass growing in both ears,
The piles and boggy prostate, the crooked penis,
    The sour taste of each day's first lie,

And that recurrent dream of years ago pulling
    A swaying bead-chain of moonlight,
Of slipping between the cool sheets of dark
    Along a body like my own, but blameless.

What good's my cut-glass conversation now,
    Now I'm so effortlessly vulgar and sad?
You get from life what you can shake from it?
    For me, it's g and t's all day and CNN.

Try the blond boychick lawyer, entry level
    At eighty grand, who pouts about overtime,
Keeps Evian and a beeper in his locker at the gym,
    And hash in tinfoil under the office fern.

There's your hound from heaven, with buccaneer
    Curls and perfumed war-paint on his nipples.
His answering machine always has room for one more
    Slurred, embarrassed call from you-know-who.

Some nights I've laughed so hard the tears
    Won't stop. Look at me now. Why now?
I long ago gave up pretending to believe 
    Anyone's memory will give as good as it gets.

So why these stubborn tears? And why do I dream
    Almost every night of holding you again,
Or at least of diving after you, my long-gone,
    Through the bruised unbalanced waves?





Going Back to Bed
 

Up early, trying to muffle
the sounds of small tasks,
grinding, pouring, riffling
through yesterday's attacks

or market slump, then changing
my mind--what matter the rush
to the waiting room or the ring
of some later dubious excuse?--

having decided to return to bed
and finding you curled in the sheet,
a dream fluttering your eyelids,
still unfallen, still asleep,

I thought of the old pilgrim
when, among the fixed stars
in paradise, he sees Adam
suddenly, the first man, there

in a flame that hides his body,
and when it moves to speak,
what is inside seems not free,
not happy, but huge and weak,

like an animal in a sack.
Who had captured him?
What did he want to say?
I lay down beside you again,

not knowing if I'd stay,
not knowing where I'd been.





The Heart of a Woman
 

The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn,
As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on,
Afar o'er life's turrets and vales does it roam
In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.

The heart of a woman falls back with the night,
And enters some alien cage in its plight,
And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars
While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.





Quest
 

The phantom happiness I sought
   O'er every crag and moor;
I paused at every postern gate,
   And knocked at every door;

In vain I searched the land and sea,
   E'en to the inmost core,
The curtains of eternal night
   Descend--my search is o'er.





Smothered Fires
 

A woman with a burning flame
   Deep covered through the years
With ashes.  Ah! she hid it deep,
   And smothered it with tears.

Sometimes a baleful light would rise
   From out the dusky bed,
And then the woman hushed it quick
   To slumber on, as dead.

At last the weary war was done
   The tapers were alight,
And with a sigh of victory
   She breathed a soft--good-night!





The Measure
 

Fierce is the conflict--the battle of eyes,
Sure and unerring, the wordless replies,
Challenges flash from their ambushing caves--
Men, by their glances, are masters or slaves.





Foredoom
 

Her life was dwarfed, and wed to blight,
Her very days were shades of night,
Her every dream was born entombed,
Her soul, a bud,--that never bloomed.





The Return
 

Again we meet--a flashing glance,
And then, to scabbard, goes the lance,
While thoughts troop on in cavalcade
Adown the wide aisles time has made.

Back in the glow of yesterday,
With tender troth you rode away,
The sheen of rainbows in our eyes,
That swept the rim of other skies.

And now a writhing worm am I,
Beneath a doomed love's lensing eye,
Let me but stagger, far from sight,
To hide my anguish, in the night.





My Little Dreams
 

I'm folding up my little dreams
   Within my heart tonight,
And praying I may soon forget
   The torture of their sight.

For time's deft fingers scroll my brow
   With fell relentless art--
I'm folding up my little dreams
   Tonight, within my heart.





In the Winter of My Thirty-Eighth Year
 

It sounds unconvincing to say When I was young
Though I have long wondered what it would be like
To be me now
No older at all it seems from here
As far from myself as ever

Walking in fog and rain and seeing nothing
I imagine all the clocks have died in the night
Now no one is looking I could choose my age
It would be younger I suppose so I am older
It is there at hand I could take it
Except for the things I think I would do differently
They keep coming between they are what I am
They have taught me little I did not know when I was young

There is nothing wrong with my age now probably
It is how I have come to it
Like a thing I kept putting off as I did my youth

There is nothing the matter with speech
Just because it lent itself
To my uses

Of course there is nothing the matter with the stars
It is my emptiness among them
While they drift farther away in the invisible morning





I Live Up Here
 

I live up here
And a little bit to the left
And I go down only
 
For the accidents and then
Never a moment too soon
 
Just the same it's a life it's plenty
 
The stairs the petals she loves me
Every time
Nothing has changed
 
Oh down there down there
Every time
The glass knights lie by their gloves of blood
 
In the pans of the scales the helmets
Brim over with water
It's perfectly fair
 
The pavements are dealt out the dice
Every moment arrive somewhere
 
You can hear the hearses getting lost in lungs
Their bells stalling
And then silence comes with the plate and I
Give what I can
 
Feeling It's worth it
 
For I see
What my votes the mice are accomplishing
And I know I'm free
 
This is how I live
Up here and simply
 
Others do otherwise
Maybe





The End
 

When I know what people think of me
I am plunged into my loneliness.  The grey
 
hat bought earlier sickens.
I have no purpose no longer distinguishable.
 
A feeling like being choked
enters my throat.





If It Should Ever Come
 

And we are all there together
time will wave as willows do
and adios will be truly, yes,
 
      laughing at what is forgotten
and talking of what's new
admiring the roses you brought.
How sad.
 
You didn't know you were at the end
thought it was your bright pear
the earth, yes
 
another affair to have been kept
and gazed back on
when you had slept
to have been stored
as a squirrel will a nut, and half
forgotten,
there were so many, many
from the newly fallen.





from Deaf Republic: 1
 

Such is the story made of stubbornness and a little air,
a story sung by those who danced before the Lord in quiet.
Who whirled and leapt. Giving voice to consonants that rise
with no protection but each other's ears.
We are on our bellies in this silence, Lord.

Let us wash our faces in the wind and forget the strict shapes of affection.
Let the pregnant woman hold something of clay in her hand.
For the secret of patience is his wife's patience
Let her man kneel on the roof, clearing his throat,
he who loved roofs, tonight and tonight, making love to her and her forgetting,
a man with a fast heartbeat, a woman dancing with a broom, uneven breath.
Let them borrow the light from the blind.
Let them kiss your forehead, approached from every angle.
What is silence? Something of the sky in us.
There will be evidence, there will be evidence.
Let them speak of air and its necessities. Whatever they will open, will open.

Winter is out for a lot this year
the beach already is stiff
all will be one will be one this year
wings and ice will be one in the world
all will be changed in the world:
the boat will hear its steps on the ice
the war will hear its war on the ice
the woman will hear her hour on the ice
the hour of birth in the ice of death
winter is out for a lot.
Out for the houses the cities
out for the forests the clouds
the mountains the valleys fear
the heart the children peace.

Winter is out for a lot this year
the hand already is stiff
the crying of children is heard in the house
one will we be one life
I hear my house slip with the world
and scream all that has been screamed
the heart rams its boat into ice
shells rustling in the hull
winter is out for as much.

If I freeze fast in the ice
if you freeze fast my child
my great forest next summer
my great fear as I come
if you freeze fast my life:
then I am a vulture of wings and ice
tearing my liver, my living life
awake in eternity.

This winter is in for a lot.

from Letter in April: IV
 

Already on the street
with our money clutched
in our hands,
and the world is a white laundry,
where we are boiled and wrung
and dried and ironed,
and smoothed down
and forsaken
we sweep
back
in children's dreams
of chains and jail
and the heartfelt sigh
of liberation
and in the spark trails
of feelings
the fire eater
the cigarette swallower
come 
to light
and we pay
and distance ourselves
with laughter.






from Letter in April: VII
 

On the street
with our money
clutched
in our hands,
buying bread
and scattering breadcrumbs
for the bluish
doves.
Paying
to see
the fire eater,
the cigarette swallower
and the dead vagabond
who breathes.
Greeting
the palm tree
that sighs
at night.
Saying a few words
to the staring
stone figure
above the gate.
Laughing
and rushing
in
as if chased.
In the cool kitchen
we prepare
and arrange our food.
We make it as elegant
as we can.
Bouquet on the table
and all.
And we speak
in our own
clear 
language.
Who knows
if things don't
know in themselves
that we're called
something else. 






from Lives of the Dead:  An Epic: Chapter One 
 

Shmerl sells to Berl,and Berl buys from Getzl.And inside of them all like a hole inside the bagelis death, also known as Detzl.
And the dead man lay in the cart
pale with shame and helplessness,
and diapered like an infant in his diapers
without trousers and without underpants.

And his lips taut in a twist of disgrace:
I can no longer satisfy a woman.

Completely starkers, no coat and no trousers,
just wrapped in a white sheet, like a baby wrapped in diapers,
here lies the dead man on the narrow cart
that strolls slowly down the path of dust.
And before the cart walks the cantor and sings, wearing his trousers
chewing with his dry stalk voice dry prayers,
and after the cart comes a woman, weeping, dressed in widow's weeds,
and her face swollen and red as the face of one straining in the toilet,
and a handful of men hang around her in a murmur of trousers,
and nod their heads and honk from time to time their schnozzles.

At the lip of the hole the dead man was displayed and there was silence.
And the dead man knew and they all knew he was not a man any longer,
for his dear trousers had been stripped from him forever,
as a mark that he would never again
evince a groan of pleasure from the throat of woman
they wrapped him in the baby's white nappy cotton.
And when they cast him in the baby's white nappy down to the hole's bottom
the dead man's lips were pale with the terrible humiliation
and stretched backward in the rictus of an apologetic grin
and he had a fierce need to swallow the bile of his shame, but his mouth was all dry.

The mouth of the living is awash with spit, it has enough to melt and wash within it
pigs and fish and cakes and still have enough to spit at friends;
and the dead man's dry mouth has not enough to silently swallow the disgrace of his death.

And the level of the dead man's mouth is set below the living woman's crotch
and is found in the thick of the earth on the plateau of the sewage pipes 
there the deceased is joined to all the dumb host of the dead
that lie in the darkness, stretched on their backs
keeping the eternal watch on the filth and stink of the great warehouses of shit.

Rise and join up with death, set off on the great adventure,
go stink at attention, lie debased and groveling
in the great boot camp of blind obedience,
go defend in darkness the kit bags of refuse
of the woman that you left overhead,
that she lowers down to you dawn by dawn
with a little cloudy water, through the drain.

Nighttime, silence. Just the fermenting sound of bodies rotting,
like an unceasing moan, and from here and there above the bark of a toilet,
a burst of water in the bowl streams like wild mocking laughter, full of living
and Bob's your uncle, filth goes down the chute, slides down
after it a kind of gurgle of new water in the bowl
as if it hadn't had its fill of laughing, and adds a little chortle
in the face of the deceased who wants to swallow spit
while his mouth is dry, surrounded by shame and debris.

And the crotch of the woman gazed drily
as the dead man was lowered to stink
four yards beneath the soles of her feet
on one level with the sewage lines

and the woman's rear in the smallest room
will be above him like a sentence for all time.






To S. M. A Young African Painter, On Seeing His Works
 

         TO show the lab'ring bosom's deep intent,
And thought in living characters to paint,
When first thy pencil did those beauties give,
And breathing figures learnt from thee to live,
How did those prospects give my soul delight,
A new creation rushing on my sight?
Still, wond'rous youth! each noble path pursue,
On deathless glories fix thine ardent view:
Still may the painter's and the poet's fire
To aid thy pencil, and thy verse conspire!
And may the charms of each seraphic theme
Conduct thy footsteps to immortal fame!
High to the blissful wonders of the skies
Elate thy soul, and raise thy wishful eyes.
Thrice happy, when exalted to survey
That splendid city, crown'd with endless day,
Whose twice six gates on radiant hinges ring:
Celestial Salem blooms in endless spring.
Calm and serene thy moments glide along,
And may the muse inspire each future song!
Still, with the sweets of contemplation bless'd,
May peace with balmy wings your soul invest!
But when these shades of time are chas'd away,
And darkness ends in everlasting day,
On what seraphic pinions shall we move,
And view the landscapes in the realms above?
There shall thy tongue in heav'nly murmurs flow,
And there my muse with heav'nly transport glow:
No more to tell of Damon's tender sighs,
Or rising radiance of Aurora's eyes,
For nobler themes demand a nobler strain,
And purer language on th' ethereal plain.
Cease, gentle muse! the solemn gloom of night
Now seals the fair creation from my sight.





from Deaf Republic: 2. 9AM Bombardment
 

Running down Vasenka street my clothes in a pillowcase
I was looking for a man who looks exactly like me
so I could give him my Sonya, my name, my clothes.
Running down Vasenka street with my lips moving,
one of those who run from the trolley that bursts like an intestine in the sun,
those who lock the door, lock it with the second key,
and who try to speak, stutter but try to speak.
A wife screams as if she were in labor & she was in labor.

Running by windows where women bought lemon and fish and garlic,
to the right madame Gornik painted icons sold at morning,
to the left lived Veronina, mother of two boys
who stole tomato sandwiches from her boys.
We stuttered and drank and laughed like barefoot peasants
and also drank quietly, damning only the earth and quietly
we made vodka from cherries, vodka from wooden chairs. 

It has begun: they climb the trolleys 
at the thief market, breaking
all their moments in half. And the army officers
in the clanging trolleys shoot at our neighbors' faces
and in their ears. And the army officer says: Boys! Girls!
take your partner two steps. Shoot.

It has begun: I saw how the blue canary of my country
picks breadcrumbs from each soldier's hair
picks breadcrumbs from each soldier's eyes.
Rain leaves the earth and falls straight up as it should.
To have a country, so important,
to run into walls, into streetlights, into loved ones, as one should.
Watch their legs as they run and fall.
I have seen the blue canary of my country
watch their legs as they run and fall.





from Deaf Republic: 3
 

Don't forget this: Men who live in this time remember the price of each bottle of vodka. Sunlight on the canal outside the train-station. With the neighbor's ladder, my brother Tony "Mosquito and I climb the poplar in the public garden with one and a half bottles of vodka and we drink there all night. Sunlight on a young girl's face, asleep on the church steps. Tony recites poems, forgets I cannot hear. I watch the sunlight in the rearview mirror of trolleys as they pass. Don't forget this. There sat in the poplar two brothers, the barber and podiatrist, in love with the same woman. They drank there and recited each poem they knew. Not a soul noticed: notasoul.





from Deaf Republic: 4
 

"You must speak not only of great devastation
but of women kissing in the yellow grass!

I heard this not from a great philosopher 
but from my brother Tony

who could do four haircuts in thirteen minutes,
his eyes closed, reciting our National Anthem to the mirror.

"You must drink cucumber vodka and naked sing all night
Unite women and boys of the Earth!

He played the accordion out of tune in a country
where the only musical instrument is the door.

"Speak not only of great devastation
so said my brother, who could not write or read

but spent his days covered in other people's hair.





from Deaf Republic: 5. And They Drag The Living Body In The Sunlit Piazza
 

I watch loud animal bones in their faces & I can smell the earth.
Our boys want a public killing in a sunlit piazza
They drag a young policeman, a sign in his arms swaying
           "I arrested the girls of Vasenka
For the boys have no idea how to kill a man.
The bald man in a barbershop whispers, I will kill him for
             a box of oranges.
On a lucid morning they pay a box of oranges.
The bald man arrives with white towels and a soap and a bottle 
             of white wine.
He eats raw egg broken into a cup.
And he smells a trickle of lemons in the snow
And he tosses that egg down his throat like a shot of tequila
He is washing his hands, he is putting his tongue where his tooth has been
And our girls spit in the policeman's nostrils
It is the spittle of our people freezing in the avenues.
The policeman is handsome, he was playing volleyball when the boys caught him.
And a pigeon settles on a stop sign, making it sway.
For our boys sign: start.
Our girls, wet and freckled, cross themselves. 
The bald man talks with his fingers to the wall. 
His eyes are wet with sweat in the rain.
He jumps on the boy and hugging him stabs him in 
             the lung.
The policeman flies above the sidewalk.
The bald man stabs in the air, shovels in the crowd a hole with arms 
             and legs.
In the deaf ear there is no such sound as the squeal of a hole. He kisses 
the hundred-fifty-pound body of his classmate.
It is the girls who take the earth 
And put it in their shirts.





from Deaf Republic: 6
 

Through Vasenka: a herd of boys runs. With their icy hands they haul a policeman and for an apple a look they display the man on the asphalt. Snow falls in his nostrils. I watch him. They circle his eyes with a red pencil. They teach his neighbors to spit in two red holes. I watch the snowflakes melt in their hair. The neighbor aims in the red circle, spits. I stand on a park bench and chew snow. Boys walk west of Tedna, carrying snowflakes in their hair. A neighbor aims in the hole, spits. Walking by night with their arms lifted up from their bodies. As if they were about to leave the earth. And were trying out the wind.





from Deaf Republic: 7. Sonya Considers Happiness
 

Dr. Alfonso Barabinsky wants 
to go outside
I hold him down with my smaller body.
He walks, runs from his shoes to my kitchen.
He is drinking in my kitchen,
He swims in my kitchen with his varicose fat legs.
Alfonso, you fool. You 
think it is brave to drink
vodka all morning on an empty stomach.
The walls of our apartment flash. 
The walls of our apartment 
stand. They are bombing his hospital.
He washes my face. 
He fingerspells the names of patients.
The shadow of his fingers huge on the whitewashed wall.
The walls of our apartment flash.
When the bombs fall
we make children.

He kneels and kisses
through my skin
the shape of our only child.
They are bombing his office.
Takes his glasses off and lays them on the table like a shining weapon. 
Throws his t-shirt 
at our cat, fat hangs over his belt.
Pulls a stolen lemon
out his pocket.
They are bombing his hospital office,
But I am a ripe woman
a man could be happy.





from Deaf Republic: 8
 

I look at you, Alfonso
and say

to the late
caterpillars

good morning, Senators!
this is a battle

worthy 
of our weapons.

I am not a poet, Sonya I inspect
the fragrant feet of younger ladies--
 
While deafness hums as a little motor
I watch her stand in the shower
 
holding her breasts 
in her hands like two small explosions.
 
I am her boy drowning. 
In this country he does not know
 
the word for "drowning and yells:
"I am diving for the last time!





from Deaf Republic: 10
 

I kissed a woman
whose freckles 
aroused our neighbors.

Her trembling lips
meant come to bed.
Her hair falling down in the middle

of the conversation
meant come to bed.
I walked in my hospital of thoughts.

Yes, I carried her off to bed
on the chair of my
hairy arms. But parted lips

meant kiss my parted lips,
I read those lips
without understanding

soft lips meant
kiss my soft lips.
Such is a silence 

of a woman who 
speaks against silence, knowing 
silence is what 

moves us to speak.





from Deaf Republic: 11
 

It is December 8 and my brother Tony was killed by the soldiers. December 8 and the police are reopening the Southern Trolleyways. December 8 when my wife lifts Tony's body from the ground, his arm tied over her shoulder--her face is damp, her hair dirty. And the soldiers unveil the damn Trolleyways, and I stand feeling (a quick march of bumps across my back and thighs) nothing. When she comes home, I run a bath for Sonya and wash her hair, gently mixing the finest of my brother's shampoos with quiet precision, while Sonya cries and cries.





from Deaf Republic: 12. Sonya Speaks Slowly, As If Unaffected
 

I remember Tony arguing in front of his mirrors, the soldiers
were painting the trees, Tony sat

on the floor of white hair, and all the trees were
painted white. And he spat at Alfonso's irony, but when

they played accordion, the fourth among us had no name.
"I am not sleeping with Tony! He simply cuts my hair!

--but our dinner is a tiny blue fish and, with my lean brother-in-law,
we are playing cards. I pull spade after spade after spade but

this skinny sparrow, this barber no simple soul, takes me
with his fingers by my nose and kisses me, quickly, on the lips!

When Tony washed my hair, when Alfonso
kissed between my toes, when my lips

trembled, when the fourth one laughed, when Tony slept, slept in the earth,
on the empty streets of our district, a bit of wind

called for the life which no one knew, a life
which daily took all of us: my neighbor

taken, his wife taken, their apartment quiet.
I say this slowly, as if unaffected:

their apartment quiet, on the floor, dirty water from their boots.





from Deaf Republic: 13. For My Brother, Tony
 

Love cities, this is what my brother taught me
as he cut soldiers' hair, then tidied tomatoes 

watching Sonya and I dance on a soapy floor--
I open the window, say in a low voice, my brother.

The voice I do not hear when I speak to myself is the clearest voice.
But the sky was all around us once.

We played chess with empty matchboxes,
he wrote love letters to my wife 

and ran outside and ran back, yelling to her, "You! Mail has arrived!
Brother of a waltzing husband, barber of a waltzing wife

(I do not speak, you do not speak, we 
do not speak, we do not speak, we do not)

waltzing away from himself 
on Vasenka's warm bricks--

he blessed us with his loneliness, a light winged being.
"Your legs stick out of your trousers too much!

--Tony, yell at me. I need propping up
in this hairy leg business. A man on earth escapes and runs and yells and stands in silence--silence

which is a soul's noise.
At the funeral I, embarrassed by resistance fighters

standing up to shake my hand, said
I wear your trousers, in the right hand pocket, a hole.
I wrap your hearing aids in this white t-shirt--
with brief gifts 

you go my eye-green brother.
And I, a fool, live.

Each man has a quiet that revolves
around him as he beats his head against the earth. But I am laughing

hard and furious. I pour a glass of pepper vodka
and toast the gray wall. I say we were

never silent. We read each other's lips and said
one word four times. And laughed four times

in loving repetition. We read each other's lips to uncover
the poverty of laughter. Touch the asphalt with fingers to hear the cool earth of Vasenka

Deposit ears into the raindrops on a fisherman's tobacco hair.
And whoever listens to me: being

there, and not being, lost and found
and lost again: Thank you for the feather on my tongue,

Motionless forgetful music of women and men
touching each forehead, breathing a soul into each immeasurable other,

on earth where we are, stranger, through madness unattainable
or grace, in difficult traffic reaching for each immeasurable other:

no one on earth (O bitterness, O desire,--who commands the ships?--
or, who--) touching the Lord's shoulder, and breathing a soul, has measured

this motionless forgetful music of women and men. Thus
I (behind the eye what sleeps?) must from the blind borrow this light.

The Solitude of Night
 

It was at a wine party--
I lay in a drowse, knowing it not. 
The blown flowers fell and filled my lap. 
When I arose, still drunken, 
The birds had all gone to their nests, 
And there remained but few of my comrades. 
I went along the river--alone in the moonlight.





from Lives of the Dead:  An Epic: Chapter Two 
 

And the man said, what has the dead man left
if not to be philosophical,
I've plenty of time here at my disposal
to solve the deep meaning of it all.

The man peeked in himself and knew
in this life there is no riddle.

In the darkness of a sealed hole, in the small sad world of his flesh's dispersal
the dead man manages his miserable dead existence.
And as will happen to a man asleep with his mouth open who dreams a dream
so a friendly wise guy stops all of a sudden overhead and drops his pants to take a leak 
in his mouth for a lark
and the sleeping man leaps up in pained surprise
and shakes his head and spits and wipes the ordure from his mouth
and for a moment the human world is lit before him with a burning glow that nauseates
thus the mud is stuffed and the water drawn to fill
the hollow in the open mouth of the dead man
and the dead man does not jump and does not spit and does not protest,
and only the pained surprise on his face does not fade.

And the dead man got sick with sorrow and his flesh wasted away
and his pale lips ate back from the rim of his mouth, and his teeth bared a foolish grin
and for all he tried to shut his grin, that smile of the embarrassed dead, apologetic,
to swathe his face in a severe frown of wrath as befits one in pain,
the more his teeth unveiled, and the grin broadened, and stretched from ear to ear
and became the twisted crude laugh of a good for nothing.

All the dead lie flat, laughing crudely toward heaven
as if they saw over them hope wink
like a troupe of ugly women chortling at a disco
at the bad joke of a fat man without a penny, while in their hearts there's bitterness.

And the dead man takes to heart the fact that he will not soon rise from this hole
and a long time more he'll pass in tortuous lying on his back without a stir
so he says, how shall a man spend his death, what remains
if not to ponder, study, and resolve the riddle of his days.

For the lives of the dead are good and fit to think thoughts, he's solitary
a confirmed bachelor for the rest of his days, children and milkmen don't bother him,
his organ doesn't jump and his heart does not beat,
and his brain is not flooded with the poisoned blood of lust
and he's not worried about his health, he's not conflicted
about the puzzle of what's preferable, gymnastics or swimming,
and he bears a certain resemblance to a poet sitting at the foot of a mountain,
staring at the sky revealed between the tops of the trees
and drawing analogies to the mountain and casting them in rhyme schemes
till suddenly the mountain falls on him and buries him beneath
and he continues lying in the poet's swoon and keeps musing on the mountain
only this time with no analogies and no rhyme scheme.

Then the dead man lights the dim lantern of his memory, that tends to gutter
and illumines the dark ends of his soul, that are covered in death's cold mosses,
to rummage after the secret of his life, its joy, sorrow and meaning.
But as the man gnaws through his soul, his soul is full of magazines,
in all the basement of his soul roll only tatters of magazines
and piles and piles of newspapers fill even the hidden chambers of his heart that are unknown.

How the man's soul longs for an evening paper,
his daily bread at noon while life he lived,
--oh the juicy headlines, wafting smells of meat and spices,
and oh the little typeface sweet and crisp, melting in your mouth!
And at noon he grasped the evening paper,
and his hand brushed it even at nighttime,
and even the next day he fondled it a bit,
like the mechanic fondling of an old lover--
so newspapers filled him till there was not room for anything else.

Even at noon on the day of his death, while still he lived in sweat,
the man read as he sat to his repast, lots of news items
about what was happening in Iran 
and the family of the Shah of Iran
and about the American reaction
and about the strange dealings between
the ministers of Trade and Treasury in our fair land.
These were the last things his soul pondered
the man who lived at noon on the day of his death.
He didn't understand how the Shah of Iran 
got to where he got to,
and in this confusion over the Shah of Iran
death jumped on him suddenly in all its rage.

And when the man set to deciphering his life's meaning,
he saw the Shah of Iran peep at him from his soul's cellars
(he and his wife and his three children had applied there for asylum)
and the minister of Trade and Treasury and noted matchmaker Venus Katz,
and many more Presidents and ministers and generals and members of parliament
and pimps and car thieves and television presenters and football players,
they and their wives and their kids in a great milling multitude
with all the ordure accompanying them from the depths of the newspapers,
and they're squealing and parading in the cellars of the soul of the dead man
and eating and moving their bowels and making a mess, they spit and suppurate
and the ceiling of the dead man's soul is begrimed,
smeared with the vapor of these people and their sweat,
that rises in a stink from the prattle of their mouths and breath of their noses,
and from their armpits and holes in their loins and goop between their toenails
and the floor of the dead man's soul is rank
with the spat out shells and crumbs and empty sweet wrappers of men 
and piss of children trailing after them with noses running.

Then the man knew that he'd been cheated by the world,
and that he'd no foundation and data from which to decipher life's meaning
and that his soul was shaped like an army crapper
where there's an endless shortage of tissue
and so many torn ends of evening newspaper
roll there and every tear of newspaper 
contains a tail end of crumpled news or squished story
and is wiped in the middle with a good wipe and rolls on the earth to where it will.

The Shah of Iran laughed, and his children laughed in turn
and the minister of Trade and Treasury laughed (one by one),
and Venus Katz laughed, and she's already pairing up a laughing man with a woman busting a gut,
and around them a multitude laughs and cheers and celebrates.

And the dead man cried a desperate cry for his base life that was lost,
and no one heard the dead man's awful moan
for it was choked in the hollow of his mouth that was stuffed with earth.

And not a sound was heard at the graveside, and there was silence
except for a little simmering, a whispering hiss,
like the sound of a silent fart, 
like the sound of a flute that plays so quiet,
till all that's heard is the flautist's breath
which is the voice of the body that's sadly rotting
and makes such a sad romantic noise.

And the dead man was shown as an empty vessel
and the riddle of his base life
was a foot pad for the soles of the shoes
of the relations of the Shah of Iran.

And his lips lap with an obsequious grin
the exchange rate of the dollar and price of kerosene.






A Toast for Men Yun-Ching
 

Illimitable happiness, 
But grief for our white heads. 
We love the long watches of the night, the red candle. 
It would be difficult to have too much of meeting,
Let us not be in hurry to talk of separation. 
But because the Heaven River will sink, 
We had better empty the wine-cups. 
To-morrow, at bright dawn, the world's business will entangle us. 
We brush away our tears, 
We go--East and West.





from Lives of the Dead:  An Epic: Chapter Three
 

And one more desire the dead man had left
to be taken to his father's bosom
and hide his crumbling face
and weep with his arms round the neck
of his progenitor that's rotting.

And the laughing gold skull of his father refrained:
I too had a father and I too yearned.

Slowly, slowly the lines of the dead man's face vanished,
the shape of his body gradually shrank,
nature carved the dead man to the style
and single mold of all the dead from way back.

And the remaining frame of his lips locked with the dust
and hid in the earth surrounding it
and the shamed smile of the man gradually dimmed
and melted in the thick of the earth.

And the dead man forgot his ignominy and forgot the Shah of Iran
and the minister of Trade and Treasury and the matchmaker Venus Katz,
and all the ends of evening newspaper became a sticky paste
and mixed with the universe's general rubbish
and the dead man who cried as he was lowered in the hole and wept for many days
was already quiet now, faithfully devoted to the process of his death,
a dedicated student of the nature of decomposition and the kidney,
innocent and untouched by any contact with the life over his head,
a retired righteous man, silent monk, 
purifying in the silence of his death,
and his brows raised a little in an expression of spiritual uplift.

And with the sinking of his life's filth and clarification of his soul,
the dead man listened to his innards
and there was silence, complete and absolute was the silence,
and in the middle of the quiet, the heart of stillness, like a boat 
on a section of congealed lake water,
he heard a faint silent keen, the keen of a little boy,
a kind of peep that was folded and cramped in the inmost part of his soul
so many years, like the first cheep crushed
in the breast of the chick hidden in the egg,
for is it not the eternal keen, that is not drawn and is not drained,
the keen of the boy to be hung upon the neck of his Dad.

For what more is left in us when we peel away--
the paper and the wife and a crust of bread?
Being held up in our father's arms, the frightened face pressed
in between hot neck, smelling of fresh soap
and the collar of his fresh pressed shirt.

There, in that place, a spot we've known, a warm hollow
between the neck and armpit, a little island of tranquility.
This island is lost, but we still search in every person
for arms that will lift us up,
in every face--the glow of our father that floods
with love's dew our tears.

All of the people, from one year old to seventy
whether alive or dead, all need Daddy.

Here's the hooker standing on the corner at nightfall
and here's the old man going up to her.
She's an orphan. Though she has breasts and thighs,
and apparently something more useful, still
her eyes dart around, clearly: she has no Daddy.
And the old man, it goes without saying, he too is orphaned.
And two orphans meet, both a little scared,
they fix a price, they go in the yard,
he drops his pants and she--her dress,
and an orphan manhood rises--falls--
where are the uplifting arms of Daddy!
--and spread before it an orphan crotch and in another minute,
the great sorrow of orphanhood enfolds 
a dozen (or fewer) feeble thrusts
like an orphan's Kaddish on a morning of Tevet,
and as an orphan cop sneaks in the yard
and catches the two orphans by the neck
and leads them to the patrol car
there they sit, an enclosed trio,
three orphans in the silence of their ache,
without knowing what and where and how,
and the paddy wagon's siren wails out the great sob:
here ride three people that lost their Daddy.

And the dead man lay on his couch, and the mold of a skeleton
was already drawn through the torn ends of his flesh,
and his face is turned on high, expectantly, and waits for his Daddy.

In your love I trust, Daddy, I know 
that you will come when I call. And as I trust in death
and know he'll come, all the more
I trust my Daddy, for who
if not my Daddy stands behind the gate of death
and in his hand a suitcase holding all my summer clothes, 
swimming trunks and towel,
and in his other hand a lunch pail, and in it a buttered roll and pear
and in the breach he stands, my Dad, and waits for me and smiles:
What, didn't you know that after death there is a summer camp
and God is the lifeguard?

And in another town, in another graveyard, old
lay the Daddy of the dead man, all skeleton
a veteran resident of the world of carrion and shame
and from his exposed skull beams a horrified grin.

For he too, the Daddy, is an orphan, he too has no Daddy,
and he too wants, why not, to hide his face in his father's neck
and find there the consolations of his life and death.

And his father too has a Daddy, a Daddy.
And all the fathers are sons, and when you peel back their skins
and see they're little children, and all dream of being raised up
to the soap-washed fresh neck flesh of Daddy.

O miserable dead, what will you do if you exit your graves,
climb one over another, orphan over his sire,
and form a motley chain of skeletons, a ladder of bones,
of sons and fathers whose head will disappear into the clouds?
And how will you console one another, for when the father hangs
his two hands on his father's throat, how will he handle his son?

Who will console whom? Who lie in the bosom of whom? Many
consolation-hungry stiffs will quarrel over a bosom?
And where is the bosom? Where is the neck? Did anybody ever catch a whiff
here even once of the smell of fresh soap?

O miserable dead, this isn't California,
this is the dark grave and this is death!
So shall a son leave his father and mother
and man leave his wife and cleave unto his death.

And the dead man saw how his father betrayed him.
And his father's skull grinned its horrified grin.
And with it grinned his father's father's skull, and grinned
his fathers' fathers to the last generation.
And as the audience's smile gleams in the dark of an auditorium
at seeing the threadbare comedy (not a smile of pleasure,
but a smile of delight at the misery of actors embarrassing themselves)
so, from the darkness of their cellar graves, shone the horrified grins
and skulls upon skulls upon skulls rolled in silent mirth
at the sight of the eternal son, his foolish hope to be taken to his father's bosom,
and his bitter cry in the hole, this is the eternal cry, that rolls endlessly
gladdens the heart, each in his turn, of the audience of hole residents.

With death the bonds of family are loosed
and son to his father's a dog
and on Passover night each one by one
will lick his own bones alone.

Our father, who us did love,
his mouth is gaped to heaven: ruff, ruff!






from Lives of the Dead:  An Epic: Chapter Four 
 

And the dead man was sick with sorrow
and his flesh wasted away
and his pale lips ate back from his mouth
and his teeth were bared in a base grin.

And the man tore from his face the grin
and there underneath it rose a chortling.

With the flesh gone the heart's desire dried.
Life, dreams are of flesh. Now
flesh was gone. Who's next in line? The bone.

Without tears and sorrow and without waving a hanky
bones took their leave of the dead man, from the one body
and left, each bone on its solitary journey.
As cries lose touch with the crier's mouth,
lose touch with the pain that gave them birth,
and set sail in the air, playful gusts of sound,
so the bones quit the body of the dead man
to roll an independent roll through the ground.

And the dead man continually shrank, and continually shriveled,
bit by bit of him was lost.
The leg detached from the body and went its way
and became a separate entity.
The hands left one another and became estranged,
what are you to me, we were sisters,
we clapped together, now we're grown old,
two gray spinsters, hard bitten,
falling apart is something we can manage to do alone.

Indeed, the mesh of bone is tough, you will not melt it
with longings and memories; another world, hard and strange
hides beneath our flesh; bone does not love
does not remember, not women 
and not the light of the sun, with a rubbing sound
like the sound of porcelain scratching,
it crumbles and with the knock of breaking bones
the living form recedes and is forgotten.

Goodbye legs, goodbye hands, goodbye hip sockets and spare ribs,
goodbye spine and collar bone, goodbye all of you
we knew together a kind of rickety ensemble good for taking pains
that bore on it with a sigh a sackful of hanks of meat
for Christmas; Christmas is past, the meat consumed
it's time to part even from the bone that bears,
so now is our parting season, the tree's leaves
fall in autumn, so our body loses its leaves.

And of the dead man just a little ball of skull is left,
and in it four holes packed and bunged with earth
and since the flesh of lips is all eaten and his teeth bared to the end,
the shameful smile of the dead man is lost and he's mixed with the earth,
and from between bared jaws, as from a broken urn, a last grin blossoms
for is it not a horrified grin, in the skull of death.

The dead man lay in his grave's darkness and smiled his horrified grin
that all his forefathers grinned at him (and he joined in
watching the crowd of the dead, and waits expectantly
for the funny spectacle of his son's death, his fall into the grave
and his ridiculous desire to be taken to his father's bosom),
and they all lay, a field strewn with skulls,
each man a skull deaf and dumb
fastened into the earth and gazing up into the night sky.

And opposite the night sky checkered with stars beaming--
winking at the magnificence of the universe and its secret,
there is a firmament below, rolling with rollicking skulls--
winking at the horrors of death and its terrors.

And firmament looks at firmament, as in a funhouse mirror.
And a man all bent, that goes home alone at night,
seeking a fitting mirror to the burden of his life,
won't raise his head on high and won't wonder at the universe's mysteries
only he'll gaze below, for there the sky suits him
and it has no secret, only a piercing pain
and it has no riddle, only a laughable solution,
and there is no dome of blue, only a peel of mockery
where score upon score of horrified grins
shine gleaming from the lower firmament,
like stains of fat from a butcher's filthy apron.

Indeed, it seems shame has no end,
as if death put paid to everything
and only left the insult that wriggles.
And as it grows darker, and there was a dark there
inside of darkness, and as the dead man dies further
and gets lesser, fainter, and crumbles
so the shame magnifies.

And as one who shuts his eyes and squints in the darkness with great effort
suddenly sees colorful stains of light,
so, in the darkness of his adopted death, the dead man sees
the piercing shards of laughter, its cutting leaps,
colorful mockery, unexpected, sharp, a startling panoply of shades--
so hurtful, that there is nothing like it in the embraces of joy
and all the wreath of these colors was not created
except to decorate the pain of our shame.

And at the end of many years, when even the skull is fallen away
and become flakes of dust, the wind
with a whistle of contempt will cast them out
to every part, and still will be borne with them the sound 
of the cry of the dead man,
a moan so great as to never pass:
Hey, you up there, I was here too!

Home goes the tired ass, 
the lights go out slow,
whoever cried out in his sleep 
in his cradle of earth sank, mute.

With his ass and cart Messiah crawls
and cries out: "Any old iron! Any old shoes!






His Farewell to Sack
 

Farewell thou thing, time past so known, so dear
 To me as blood to life and spirit; near,
 Nay, thou more near than kindred, friend, man, wife,
 Male to the female, soul to body; life
 To quick action, or the warm soft side
 Of the resigning, yet resisting bride.
 The kiss of virgins, first fruits of the bed,
 Soft speech, smooth touch, the lips, the maidenhead :
 These and a thousand sweets could never be
 So near or dear as thou wast once to me.
 O thou, the drink of gods and angels! wine
 That scatter'st spirit and lust, whose purest shine
 More radiant than the summer's sunbeam shows;
 Each way illustrious, brave, and like to those
 Comets we see by night, whose shagg'd portents
 Foretell the coming of some dire events,
 Or some full flame which with a pride aspires,
 Throwing about his wild and active fires;
 'Tis thou, above nectar, O divinest soul !
 Eternal in thyself, that can'st control
 That which subverts whole nature, grief and care,
 Vexation of the mind, and damn'd despair.
 'Tis thou alone who, with thy mystic fan,
 Workst more than wisdom, art, or nature can
 To rouse the sacred madness and awake
 The frost-bound blood and spirits, and to make
 Them frantic with thy raptures flashing through
 The soul like lightning, and as active too.
 'Tis not Apollo can, or those thrice three
 Castalian sisters, sing, if wanting thee.
 Horace, Anacreon, both had lost their fame,
 Hads't thou not fill'd them with thy fire and flame.
 Phoebean splendour! and thou, Thespian spring!
 Of which sweet swans must drink before they sing
 Their true pac'd numbers and their holy lays,
 Which makes them worthy cedar and the bays.
 But why, why longer do I gaze upon
 Thee with the eye of admiration?
 Since I must leave thee, and enforc'd must say
 To all thy witching beauties, Go away.
 But if thy whimpering looks do ask me why,
 Then know that nature bids thee go, not I.
 'Tis her erroneous self has made a brain
 Uncapable of such a sovereign
 As is thy powerful self.   Prithee not smile,
 Or smile more inly, lest thy looks beguile
 My vows denounc'd in zeal, which thus much show thee
 That I have sworn but by thy looks to know thee.
 Let others drink thee freely, and desire
 Thee and their lips espous'd, while I admire
 And love thee, but not taste thee. Let my muse
 Fail of thy former helps, and only use
 Her inadultrate strength: what's done by me
 Hereafter shall smell of the lamp, not thee.





The Lyric "I Drives to Pick up Her Children from School: A Poem in the Postconfessional Mode
 

"i has not found, started, finished "i's morning poem,
the poem "i was writing about "i having sex with the man "i left her husband for
the night before or maybe just this morning.
a sex poem, so to speak, so to say, so as to lay...
a foundation for...
what????????

SEX

i lost my sex /poem!
how did it go?
i know it was called 

SEX

something about my bosky acres,
my unshrubb'd down
bout all being tight and yare

(bring in tiresias?)
did you say soothe?
tiresias, who lies fucking more?
whoops. 

who likes fucking more?

("bring in // the old thought //(allen grossman doing yeats)
that life prepares us for//what never happens)

today (the color of ) my sex 
was lavender then yellow 
gold then muted mossy grey and green

i bid my lover
lower
i bid my lover shhhhhhh

i bid my lover 
linger
i bid my 
lover, go

lover, go!
(see!) 

i bid my lover stay
away

"i notices it is almost time to pick up her children from school!
"i realizes she has gotten nowhere, nowhere near it, much less inside it, wasted another morning, can't fucking write a poem to save "i's life, oh well,
"i is, at least,"working.
"i pulls on her tight jeans, her big boots, her puffy parka.
"i remote starts her car.
"i's car is a 1995 red toyota 4-runner with racing stripe that doesn't have enough power for "i.
"i's car stereo also doesn't have enough power for "i.
"i drives cross town listening to dylan, who has plenty of power for "i.
"i wonders how why dylan isn't "i's man.
"i gets some looks from some lesser men, some in better, more powerful trucks, even though "i's dirty dirty-blonde hair is covered by a woolen cap.
"i feels the power of being a single mom in a red truck.
"i knows it is not enough power.
"i thinks "i am the man, i suffered, i was there.
"i is almost broke, but
"i thinks "i live more in a continuous present that i enjoy.
"i thinks "amor fati.
"i notices the chugach mountains.
"i notices the chugach mountains sometimes look good and sometimes bad.
"i remembers that yesterday the chugach mountains looked desolate and dirty and roadblocky.
"i notices the chugach mountains look particularly beautiful today covered in sun and snow.
"i almost thinks "bathed in sun and snow but stops herself.
"i feels that "i can maybe find, really start, really finish her sex poem tomorrow.
"i likes the dubus thing about adultery having a morality of its own.
"i also likes "human drama.
"i really enjoyed "i heart huckabees.
"i thought sex was overrated for a long time, then not for a year and a half, and now, again.
"i gives, well, has given, good head.
"i takes it like a man.
"i thinks there should be a new "new sexualized and radicalized poetry of the self,
"i knows the "single-minded frenzy of a raving madman but,
"i mostly keeps her head.
"i remembers that "as long ago as 1925, boris tomashevsky, a leading russian formalist critic, observed that the "autobiographical poem is one that mythologizes the poet's life in accordance with the conventions of his time. it relates not what has occurred but what should have occurred, presenting an idealized image of the poet as representative of his literary school
"i wants to be a man like marjorie perloff, helen hennessy vendler, boris tomashevsky.
"i thinks, on the other hand, "i mean i like in art when the artist doesn't know what he knows in general; he only knows what he knows specifically.
"i thinks: "that mantel piece is clean enough or my name isn't bob rauschenberg.
"i just wishes "i could talk more smarter theory, no
"i just wishes "i could write more smarter poems, no
"i thinks "WHY I AM A POET AND NOT A...
"i thinks "KALYTIAK DAVIS PAINTS A PICTURE.
"i wants to include the word "coruscate in it, and, possibly, a quote from rudolf steiner.
"i wishes she could remember abrams definition of the structure of the greater romantic lyric, but that it presents " a determinate speaker in a particularized, and usually localized outdoor setting, whom we overhear as he carries on, in a fluent vernacular which rises easily to a more formal speech, a sustained colloquy, sometimes with himself or with the outer scene, but more frequently with a silent human auditor, present or absent. and that "he speaker begins with a description of the landscape;' and that "an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied but integral process of memory, thought anticipation, and feeling which remains closely involved with the outer scene. and that  "in the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight, faces up to a tragic loss, comes to a moral decision or resolves an emotional problem. and that "often the poem rounds upon itself to end where it began, at the outer scene, but with an altered mood and deepened  understanding which is the result of the intervening meditation evades her.
"i wants to say "silent human auditor, are you absent or present? but "i knows "i makes, has made, that move too often.
"i knows "i is alone in her red truck.
"i reconsiders, perhaps it is like giving good head?
"i' thinks his his he himself, but not too bitterly, then
"i thinks "i, then,
"i thinks "you.
"i has not told her lover that "i is not in love with him any longer, but "i knows he knows, must know.
"i has not told her lover that "i had a long conversation with "i's x-husband on the phone last night.
"i thinks "my sidestepping and obliquities.
"i thinks love is what went wrong.
"i feels elizabeth bishop reprimanding "i.
"i thinks like a gentle loving firm almost slap but really just a squeeze of, not on, the hand from a, the, mother neither one of them had for very long, long enough.
"i has not thought of "i's dead mother in a long time.
i thinks of jonatham letham and his dead mother and his wall of books.
"i thinks of mark reagan and his walls and walls of books, and how his landlord, fearing collapse, made him move to the bottom floor.
"i thinks of doug teter and his smaller, but still, wall of books.
"i thinks of jude law.
"i thinks jude law probably doesn't know how to read.
"i knows that no lover can be her "objective correlative, still
"i thinks "so true a lover as theagenes.
"i thinks "so constant a friend as pylades.
"i thinks "so valiant a man as orlando.
"i  thinks "so right a prince as xenophon's cyrus
"i thinks "so excellent a man in every way as virgil's aeneas.
"i notices dylan is almost done singing "to ramona.
"i loves "everything passes, everything changes, just do what you think you should do.
"i thinks dylan is singing to "i .
"i thinks he means now, and now, and now; daily.
"i is almost there.
"i wonders if "i's meditation is too long, has gotten away from "i.
"i thinks it should take precisely as long as the ride: 15 minutes tops; well, 30  in a snowstorm.
"i knows it is not snowing.
"i wonders if "i should at this point even refer to "i's meditation.
"i thinks "man can embody truth but he cannot know it.
"i thinks "especially under stress of psychological crisis.
"i thinks what's worse, anaphora or anaphrodesia?
"i thinks of the diaphragm still inside her. 
"i shutters at the audacity of her sex. 
"i is exactly on time to pick up her daughter. 
"i must wait another 45 minutes to retrieve her son.
"i will try and remember to remove it promptly when they get back to "i's house, i.e. home. 
"i has fucked with the facts so "you think she's robert lowell. (but whoever saw a girl like robert lowell?)
"i doesn't care if "you, silent human auditor, present or absent, never heard of, could give a flying fuck about, robert lowell.





Your Night Is of Lilac
 

The night sits wherever you are. Your night
is of lilac. Every now and then a gesture escapes
from the beam of your dimples, breaks the wineglass
and lights up the starlight. And your night is your shadow--
a fairy-tale piece of land to make our dreams
equal. I am not a traveler or a dweller
in your lilac night, I am he who was one day
me. Whenever night grew in you I guessed
the heart's rank between two grades: neither
the self accepts, nor the soul accepts. But in our bodies
a heaven and an earth embrace. And all of you
is your night ... radiant night like planet ink. Night
is the covenant of night, crawling in my body
anesthetized like a fox's sleepiness. Night diffusing a mystery
that illuminates my language, whenever it is clearer
I become more fearful of a tomorrow in the fist. Night
staring at itself safe and assured in its
endlessness, nothing celebrates it except its mirror
and the ancient shepherd songs in a summer of emperors
who get sick on love. Night that flourished in its Jahili poetry
on the whims of Imru' el-Qyss and others,
and widened for the dreamers the milk path to a hungry
moon in the remoteness of speech ...





No More and No Less
 

I am a woman. No more and no less
I live my life as it is
thread by thread
and I spin my wool to wear, not
to complete Homer's story, or his sun. 
And I see what I see
as it is, in its shape,
though I stare every once
in a while in its shade
to sense the pulse of defeat,
and I write tomorrow
on yesterday's sheets: there's no sound
other than echo.
I love the necessary vagueness in
what a night traveler says to the absence
of birds over the slopes of speech
and above the roofs of villages
I am a woman, no more and no less

The almond blossom sends me flying
in March, from my balcony, 
in longing for what the faraway says:
"Touch me and I'll bring my horses to the water springs.
I cry for no clear reason, and I love you
as you are, not as a strut
nor in vain
and from my shoulders a morning rises onto you
and falls into you, when I embrace you, a night.
But I am neither one nor the other
no, I am not a sun or a moon
I am a woman, no more and no less

So be the Qyss of longing,
if you wish. As for me
I like to be loved as I am
not as a color photo 
in the paper, or as an idea
composed in a poem amid the stags 
I hear Laila's faraway scream
from the bedroom: Do not leave me
a prisoner of rhyme in the tribal nights
do not leave me to them as news 
I am a woman, no more and no less

I am who I am, as
you are who you are: you live in me
and I live in you, to and for you
I love the necessary clarity of our mutual puzzle
I am yours when I overflow the night
but I am not a land 
or a journey
I am a woman, no more and no less

And I tire
from the moon's feminine cycle
and my guitar falls ill
string 
by string
I am a woman, 
no more
and no less!





Who Am I, Without Exile?
 

A stranger on the riverbank, like the river ... water
binds me to your name. Nothing brings me back from my faraway
to my palm tree: not peace and not war. Nothing
makes me enter the gospels. Not
a thing ... nothing sparkles from the shore of ebb
and flow between the Euphrates and the Nile. Nothing
makes me descend from the pharaoh's boats. Nothing
carries me or makes me carry an idea: not longing
and not promise. What will I do? What
will I do without exile, and a long night
that stares at the water?

Water
binds me
to your name ...
Nothing takes me from the butterflies of my dreams
to my reality: not dust and not fire. What
will I do without roses from Samarkand? What
will I do in a theater that burnishes the singers with its lunar
stones? Our weight has become light like our houses
in the faraway winds. We have become two friends of the strange
creatures in the clouds ... and we are now loosened
from the gravity of identity's land. What will we do  what
will we do without exile, and a long night
that stares at the water?

Water
binds me
to your name ...
There's nothing left of me but you, and nothing left of you
but me, the stranger massaging his stranger's thigh: O
stranger! what will we do with what is left to us
of calm ... and of a snooze between two myths?
And nothing carries us: not the road and not the house.
Was this road always like this, from the start,
or did our dreams find a mare on the hill
among the Mongol horses and exchange us for it?
And what will we do?
What
will we do
without 
exile?





The Horse Fell Off the Poem
 

The horse fell off the poem
and the Galilean women were wet
with butterflies and dew,
dancing above chrysanthemum

The two absent ones: you and I
you and I are the two absent ones

A pair of white doves
chatting on the branches of a holm oak

No love, but I love ancient
love poems that guard 
the sick moon from smoke

I attack and retreat, like the violin in quatrains
I get far from my time when I am near
the topography of place ...

There is no margin in modern language left
to celebrate what we love,
because all that will be ... was

The horse fell bloodied 
with my poem
and I fell bloodied
with the horse's blood ...





In Jerusalem
 

In Jerusalem, and I mean within the ancient walls,
I walk from one epoch to another without a memory
to guide me. The prophets over there are sharing 
the history of the holy ... ascending to heaven
and returning less discouraged and melancholy, because love
and peace are holy and are coming to town.
I was walking down a slope and thinking to myself: How
do the narrators disagree over what light said about a stone?
Is it from a dimly lit stone that wars flare up?
I walk in my sleep. I stare in my sleep. I see
no one behind me. I see no one ahead of me.
All this light is for me. I walk. I become lighter. I fly
then I become another. Transfigured. Words
sprout like grass from Isaiah's messenger
mouth: "If you don't believe you won't be safe.
I walk as if I were another. And my wound a white
biblical rose. And my hands like two doves
on the cross hovering and carrying the earth. 
I don't walk, I fly, I become another,
transfigured. No place and no time. So who am I?
I am no I in ascension's presence. But I
think to myself: Alone, the prophet Muhammad
spoke classical Arabic. "And then what?
Then what? A woman soldier shouted:
Is that you again? Didn't I kill you?
I said: You killed me ... and I forgot, like you, to die.





The Cypress Broke
 

The cypress is the tree's grief and not
                                 the tree, and it has no shadow because it is
                                 the tree's shadow
                             
                                       Bassam Hajjar



The cypress broke like a minaret, and slept on
the road upon its chapped shadow, dark, green,
as it has always been. No one got hurt. The vehicles
sped over its branches. The dust blew
into the windshields ... / The cypress broke, but
the pigeon in a neighboring house didn't change
its public nest. And two migrant birds hovered above
the hem of the place, and exchanged some symbols.
And a woman said to her neighbor: Say, did you see a storm?
She said: No, and no bulldozer either ... / And the cypress
broke. And those passing by the wreckage said:
Maybe it got bored with being neglected, or it grew old
with the days, it is long like a giraffe, and little
in meaning like a dust broom, and couldn't shade two lovers.
And a boy said: I used to draw it perfectly,
its figure was easy to draw. And a girl said: The sky today
is incomplete because the cypress broke.
And a young man said: But the sky today is complete
because the cypress broke. And I said
to myself: Neither mystery nor clarity,
the cypress broke, and that is all
there is to it: the cypress broke!





I Have a Seat in the Abandoned Theater
 

I have a seat in the abandoned theater
in Beirut. I might forget, and I might recall
the final act without longing ... not because of anything
other than that the play was not written
skillfully ...
Chaos
as in the war days of those in despair, and an autobiography
of the spectators' impulse. The actors were tearing up their scripts
and searching for the author among us, we the witnesses
sitting in our seats
I tell my neighbor the artist: Don't draw your weapon,
and wait, unless you're the author!
--No
Then he asks me: And you are you the author?
--No
So we sit scared. I say: Be a neutral
hero to escape from an obvious fate
He says: No hero dies revered in the second
scene. I will wait for the rest. Maybe I would
revise one of the acts. And maybe I would mend
what the iron has done to my brothers
So I say: It is you then?
He responds: You and I are two masked authors and two masked
witnesses
I say: How is this my concern? I'm a spectator
He says: No spectators at chasm's door ... and no
one is neutral here. And you must choose
your part in the end
So I say: I'm missing the beginning, what's the beginning?





To Our Land
 

To our land,
and it is the one near the word of god,
a ceiling of clouds
To our land,
and it is the one far from the adjectives of nouns,
the map of absence
To our land, 
and it is the one tiny as a sesame seed,
a heavenly horizon ... and a hidden chasm
To our land,
and it is the one poor as a grouse's wings,
holy books ... and an identity wound
To our land,
and it is the one surrounded with torn hills,
the ambush of a new past
To our land, and it is a prize of war,
the freedom to die from longing and burning
and our land, in its bloodied night,
is a jewel that glimmers for the far upon the far
and illuminates what's outside it ...
As for us, inside,
we suffocate more!





In Her Absence I Created Her Image
 

In her absence I created her image: out of the earthly
the hidden heavenly commences. I am here weighing 
the expanse with the Jahili odes ... and absence
is the guide, it is the guide. For each rhyme a tent
is pitched. And for each thing blowing in the wind
a rhyme. Absence teaches me its lesson: If it weren't 
for the mirage you wouldn't have been steadfast ...
Then in the emptiness, I disassembled a letter from one
of the ancient alphabets, and I leaned on absence. So who am I
after the visitation? A bird, or a passerby amid the symbols
and the memory vendors? As if I were an antique piece,
as if I were a ghost sneaking in from Yabous, telling myself:
Let's go to the seven hills. Then I placed
my mask on a stone, and walked as the sleepless
walk, led by my dream. And from one moon
to another I leapt. There is enough of unconsciousness 
to liberate things from their history. And there
is enough of history to liberate unconsciousness
from its ascension. Take me to our early
years--my first girlfriend says. Leave 
the windows open for the house sparrow to enter
your dream--I say ... then I awaken, and no city is in 
the city. No "here except "there. And no there
but here. If it weren't for the mirage
I wouldn't have walked to the seven hills ...
if it weren't for the mirage!





If I Were Another
 

If I were another on the road, I would not have looked
back, I would have said what one traveler said
to another: Stranger! awaken
the guitar more! Delay our tomorrow so our road
may extend and space may widen for us, and we may get rescued
from our story together: you are so much yourself ... and I am
so much other than myself right here before you!

If I were another I would have belonged to the road,
neither you nor I would return. Awaken the guitar
and we might sense the unknown and the route that tempts
the traveler to test gravity. I am only
my steps, and you are both my compass and my chasm.
If I were another on the road, I would have
hidden my emotions in the suitcase, so my poem
would be of water, diaphanous, white,
abstract, and lightweight ... stronger than memory,
and weaker than dewdrops, and I would have said:
My identity is this expanse!

If I were another on the road, I would have said
to the guitar: Teach me an extra string!
Because the house is farther, and the road to it prettier--
that's what my new song would say. Whenever
the road lengthens the meaning renews, and I become two
on this road: I ... and another!





No Sex for Priests
 

The horse in harness suffers;
he's not feeling up to snuff.
The feeler's sensate but the cook
pronounces lobsters tough.
The chain's too short: The dog's at pains
to reach a sheaf of shade. One half a squirrel's whirling there
upon the interstate. That rough around
the monkey's eye is cancer. Only God's
impervious--he's deaf and blind. But he's
not dumb: to answer for it all, his spokesmen
aren't allowed to come.





Whispers of Immortality
 

Webster was much possessed by death
And saw the skull beneath the skin;
And breastless creatures under ground
Leaned backward with a lipless grin.

Daffodil bulbs instead of balls
Stared from the sockets of the eyes!
He knew that thought clings round dead limbs
Tightening its lusts and luxuries.

Donne, I suppose, was such another
Who found no substitute for sense,
To seize and clutch and penetrate;
Expert beyond experience,

He knew the anguish of the marrow
The ague of the skeleton;
No contact possible to flesh
Allayed the fever of the bone.

                         .  .  .  .  .

Grishkin is nice: her Russian eye
Is underlined for emphasis;
Uncorseted, her friendly bust
Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.

The couched Brazilian jaguar
Compels the scampering marmoset
With subtle effluence of cat;
Grishkin has a maisonnette;

The sleek Brazilian jaguar
Does not in its arboreal gloom
Distil so rank a feline smell
As Grishkin in a drawing-room.

And even the Abstract Entities
Circumambulate her charm;
But our lot crawls between dry ribs
To keep our metaphysics warm.

                                                               1918, 1919





Sweeney among the Nightingales
 

Apeneck Sweeney spread his knees
Letting his arms hang down to laugh,
The zebra stripes along his jaw
Swelling to maculate giraffe.

The circles of the stormy moon
Slide westward toward the River Plate,
Death and the Raven drift above
And Sweeney guards the hornd gate.

Gloomy Orion and the Dog
Are veiled; and hushed the shrunken seas;
The person in the Spanish cape
Tries to sit on Sweeney's knees

Slips and pulls the table cloth
Overturns a coffee-cup,
Reorganised upon the floor
She yawns and draws a stocking up;

The silent man in mocha brown
Sprawls at the window-sill and gapes;
The waiter brings in oranges
Bananas figs and hothouse grapes;

The silent vertebrate in brown
Contracts and concentrates, withdraws;
Rachel ne Rabinovitch
Tears at the grapes with murderous paws;

She and the lady in the cape
Are suspect, thought to be in league;
Therefore the man with heavy eyes
Declines the gambit, shows fatigue,

Leaves the room and reappears
Outside the window, leaning in,
Branches of wistaria
Circumscribe a golden grin;

The host with someone indistinct
Converses at the door apart,
The nightingales are singing near
The Convent of the Sacred Heart,

And sang within the bloody wood
When Agamemnon cried aloud
And let their liquid siftings fall
To stain the stiff dishonoured shroud.

                                                                    1918, 1919





Daddy Longlegs
 

Here, on fine long legs springy as steel,
a life rides, sealed in a small brown pill
that skims along over the basement floor
wrapped up in a simple obsession.
Eight legs reach out like the master ribs
of a web in which some thought is caught
dead center in its own small world,
a thought so far from the touch of things
that we can only guess at it. If mine,
it would be the secret dream
of walking alone across the floor of my life
with an easy grace, and with love enough
to live on at the center of myself.





Emily Sparks
 

Where is my boy, my boy--
In what far part of the world?
The boy I loved best of all in the school?--
I, the teacher, the old maid, the virgin heart,
Who made them all my children.
Did I know my boy aright,
Thinking of him as spirit aflame,
Active, ever aspiring?
Oh, boy, boy, for whom I prayed and prayed
In many a watchful hour at night,
Do you remember the letter I wrote you
Of the beautiful love of Christ?
And whether you ever took it or not,
My boy, wherever you are,
Work for your soul's sake,
That all the clay of you, all the dross of you,
May yield to the fire of you,
Till the fire is nothing but light! . . .
Nothing but light!





Monet Refuses the Operation
 

Doctor, you say there are no haloes
around the streetlights in Paris
and what I see is an aberration
caused by old age, an affliction.
I tell you it has taken me all my life
to arrive at the vision of gas lamps as angels,
to soften and blur and finally banish
the edges you regret I don't see,
to learn that the line I called the horizon
does not exist and sky and water,
so long apart, are the same state of being.
Fifty-four years before I could see
Rouen cathedral is built
of parallel shafts of sun,
and now you want to restore
my youthful errors: fixed
notions of top and bottom,
the illusion of three-dimensional space,
wisteria separate
from the bridge it covers.
What can I say to convince you
the Houses of Parliament dissolve
night after night to become
the fluid dream of the Thames?
I will not return to a universe
of objects that don't know each other,
as if islands were not the lost children
of one great continent.  The world
is flux, and light becomes what it touches,
becomes water, lilies on water,
above and below water,
becomes lilac and mauve and yellow
and white and cerulean lamps,
small fists passing sunlight
so quickly to one another
that it would take long, streaming hair
inside my brush to catch it.
To paint the speed of light!
Our weighted shapes, these verticals,
burn to mix with air
and change our bones, skin, clothes
to gases.  Doctor,
if only you could see
how heaven pulls earth into its arms
and how infinitely the heart expands
to claim this world, blue vapor without end.





Luminous Great Mass
 

Holy Trinity Airship
billows a

chrys-
elephantine
cave Louis Sullivan, Arch-
itect, lord master,
conceived of
in the hollow of power.

He swells.
I am his balloonist
balancing an azimuth

as earth-apse I
orbit, robed in
hot gas & leather

fastened by a yolk-stalk
of gravity to gold-
end onions nozzling heavens

whose suns are stomachs
with churches in their navels.

Each we are priests
as aeronauts at the vestibules,
& enter the cavity:

space, self, organ; celest-

ial nave 
bellies 

stars sailors name saints
and adore--

their egress is bitter
weeping, their praise pure
Russian form:

a cathedral,
my inner orrery.





Night Wash
 

All seas are seas in the moon to these
lonely and full of light.
High above laundries and rooftops
the pinstriped silhouettes speak nightmare
as do the faces full of fire and orange peel.
Every citizen knows what's the trouble: America's longest
river is--New York; that's what they say, and I say so.

Wonderful thing, electricity, 
all these neon and nylons spun dry by a dime
in the Fifth Street Laundromat. The city
must be flying a thousand kites tonight
with its thousands of different keys.
--Sir, excuse me, sir?
Excuse me interfering, but you don't want
to put that in--it's got a rubber backing, see? Oh, not at all . . .

Piles of workshirts, piles of leopard underthings,
it's like fishing upside down all night long, and then the moon rises
like armfuls of thready sleeves. Her voice
rising and falling, her boys folded sideways asleep on the bench:
--Listen, that old West Indian cleaning lady?
Ask anyone here, she never has change.
Come on, she's too wise . . .

Down in the Tombs
the prisoner's knuckles climb like stripes
of paint in the light. He dreams he hears
the voice of a pig he used to slop for his uncles.
It pokes its head
through the bars and says
"Have you brought any beet greens?

--You can never leave them alone at night. Like today
the stitching overseer says to me
If you can't keep the rhythm missus . . .
I say to him fire
me all you want, I don't take that shit
off anybody. That was a scare though--
you can't always get back on a day shift.

In the moonlight
the city rides serenely enough, its thousand light moorings
the hunted news in their eyes. Even the rivers
are tidal, as sailors and bankers know.
The glass bank of the Chase Manhattan stands dark
over the Harbor. One last
light slowly moving around the top floor.

--No washing machines in the basement, that's
what's the trouble. The laundry would dry overnight
on the roof, in the wind. Well a month ago
you know, some big boys took this twelveyearold
little Spanish girl up there. Then they killed her, they
threw her, six stories down. Listen, the stone age or something
running around on those roofs. So this cop said to me
Your street is the bottom, he actually
said that to me. So what could I say--that it's great?

On the folding table the same
gestures repeat, smoothing and folding
the same ancient shirt. Or the old West Indian cleaning lady
pretending to finger her pocket for change. At midnight she'll prop
her grey spaghetti mop and glide toward you
in her black cotton trousers, her black
lavender face tilted up. Very clearly
she says to the world in dream-language
I mean to live.





The Key to the City
 

All middle age invisible to us, all age
passed close enough behind to seize our napehairs
and whisper in a voice all thatch and smoke
some village-elder warning, some rasped-out
Remember me . . . Mute and grey in her city
uniform (stitch-lettered JUVENILE), the matron
just pointed us to our lockers, and went out.
What an old bag!' Got a butt on you, honey?' Listen,

did I get lost with these streetnames! Spruce
Street, Water, or get this, VANderwater--' Cautiously, coolly,
we lit up, crooking palms for the ashes. All fifteen
or under, all from Manhattan, we loitered bare
to the waist for the X-rays. In the whorling light
from one rainy window, our shapes were mere
outlines from floor to wall, opaque
as plater, white, or terra-cotta, black . . .

Names or numbers,' a skinny white girl with pale blue eyes
shrugged her shoulders. Why come here at all? You think little Susan
(thumb mockingly hooked at herself) needs working papers
to work in my uncle's diner? If they'd let me off school
at noon now--that's where the real tips are!'
And she smiled at our objections around her smoking
cigarette (I thought) like some museum mummy,
amber-fingered, fishhook collar bones--

What are you talking? Don't you know the city
keeps like an eye we don't get overworked?'
Yeah, and your Social Security number, that's
for life, girl, that ain't worth something to you?'
The skinny girl just cackled, goospimpled arms
huddled against her ribs. Whadda you two, work
for the mayor? What's this (swinging her locker key
with its scarred wooden number)--the key to the city?'

She meant last week, when they'd offered it
to some visiting queen. Even I snickered. I
was younger than most of them, homesick among the near-
women's breasts and hair, even the familiar
girls' cloakroom odors: perspiration, powder, decades
of menstrual fust--Well, I'm coming back in six months.'
This was one of the black girls, elbow swivelled
on pelvic sidethrust, finest hair--

filaments, finerimmed, sulky mouth. She'll be
sixteen, getting married,' the girl next over
burst in eagerly, He got a store job, still her folks
against it, they say stay in school. But every
afternoon--' Distantly, the first girl listened to
her own story, only breaking in at the end: I want a real
church wedding. Down here is just for the license, see?'
A license,' said "little Susan, sourly, like for a job?'

His name is Harold Curtis,' was all she answered, then It too strong
for my parents. They see it too strong for them in the end.'
In our silence, the gutter slurred strangely. And for just one
moment, everyone breathless, the atmosphere grew
almost tender. But nobody knew what to say
except good luck, so we all went on smoking like chimneys
except the one murmur, of old and incurable
anger, Listen. Listen. They get you coming and going.'

Now each girl tilts her face down, contemplating
her own unseen choices, real
tips, the solitary and common
square foot of imaginary chance . . . Outside, the rain
was letting up. The city, like a graph
of its own mountainous causes, climbed in a mist
across our window. And then the matron came, calling
our locker numbers, one by one, for the X-rays.

Jesus, it's late.' Hey honey, I'm ready!' Where'd we change
at from the D Train?' Through the clearing air on the far
side of City Hall Park, I could see a narrow street
and a streetsign: Broadway. Miles to the north
my street had a number, and Broadway was really broad.
In the concrete prows of islands, the innumerable old women
were sitting, lonely as soldiers, silent as . . .
What's up, girl? Goose step on your grave?'

Another number. And now, the room darker, each girl
cast about for the cheering word, when Listen,' I suddenly
heard my own voice saying, Guess what I saw coming down? A street
called Anne Street.'--So what?'--So my name is Anne.'
A pause, then Hey kid, that's really funny!' They all
grinned, and one of the older girls gave my shoulder
a tolerant punch. I was one of the youngest, and as far
as I can remember, that was all that I said.






Wall and Pine: The Rain
 

Now the god of rainy August hangs his mask
among the city's spires and balustrades
and stone clocktowers half-effaced in clouds.
On Park the first reflecting pool dims
with a thousand smelted-silver circle-rims,
while west on Fifth a modiste scatters leaves
in fall vitrines, and felt-browed mannequins
resign the world with gestures of disdain.

Now in the Cloister's high parterres the rain
floods copper gutterings, boxwood, terraced urns
and mottoes. "The weather turns. Clamped to their pier,
the smiling Gaul, the murderer Clotaire,
and Isaiah, green-throned, water-cowled, exchange
their fine-lit ironies for rotes of pain.





Hardware
 

You lean disconsolate on your stool,
                                        Sullen and certain 

As minor royalty rusticated to this
Unhelpful climate of solvents, gaskets, pliers, and bolts. 

Because they are new and manifold and useful

You feel their whispers against you. The staunch
Resistance of objects. How can I tell you
                                           O my soul, 

To exhaust the realm of the possible when
                                  Ever the light
Is uncongenial as February and your hand unlovely?

Like a dog nearly annihilated by nerves
And boredom chewing her paw to sore, red velvet,

You've torn your nails so far esh swells
Closed around each bed like an eyeless socket.

That you should be making such small change!

Fingers inarticulate as moles nudge a debris 
Of dimes not thick enough to hide 

The candy-colored buttery aring
Across the tender, veined delta of your hand

Heralding indelibly the eviction 
                           Of this vulgar esh

Or the one word needled in black, knuckle-Gothic
                                             R a p t u r e






To the voice of the retired warden of Huntsville Prison  (Texas death chamber)
 


Until wolf-light I will count my sheep,
       Adumbrated, uncomedic, as they are. 
       One is perdu, two, qualm, three 
                           Is sprawl, four, too late,

Night is already a thirsty county in Texas,
                            Salt at and unremitting
        Blacktop dry as my mouth, 
        And your elastic vowels, my genial,

                            My electric ghost, my
        Radio's lonely station. Because the spectacle
Of suffering corrupts us, all punishments
        Are now executive, offstage.

        Most presume you a fable:
        Echoes of approaching bootheels
That harry labyrinths of concrete corridors,
                           Or hooded in burlap. 

                           We are convicted
        As we are also pardoned: He cherished
        His lawn, or afterwards he covered
The victim's face. You make no judgments

        Yourself. Only in bursal tones,
                           Tactful as the le box
That shows, if opened, the neon, pleading heart 
        Of Jesus wrapped in barbed wire,

You perform penalties others have scripted, so
                           Untroubled by so many.
        How long I have listened to you
        For news of the opal distances,
Or rain to freshen the morning's arrival.
        What keeps me awake? Nothing
        More than a y's dysenteric violin.
                              What puts me to sleep

        Is your clement voice, saying
The dark has no teeth. While men like you live
                             In this world do I dream
          I am either safe or spared?






Song & Error
 

For Audrey Richardson Curdy (19311986)
It was 1986, when currencies to be changed
          Into multiple-launch-surface, anti-tank missiles 
Swarmed through numbered bank accounts
          Like Ovid's seething knotted seed of frog-slime,
Which not seldome attracted by the sun falls 
          In little frogs with the rain; when it also rained  
Radionuclides, strontium, caesium, & iodine,
          Over river & clay, & over the poet's Black Sea
Exile, before the prevailing winds blew them all
          Across Europe from Chernobyl (jewel of a name
That means black stalks & tasted newly of metal),
          & I was in your room trying to build a re.
Wet branches breaking, those were your breaths 
          Ripped out of the air. What was it hiding you
So that at every hour's dusk I startled on you
          Where you lay, nearly resigned in the talons 
Of your most personal shape? Something still
          Obdurate, still wild as the horned lark
Rising from its nest at the hunter's feet. 
          I didn't allow you to speak what I didn't know
To ask. As far as the bolted iron door to adust 
          I could have followed, to watch the way 
You put on your ame like sweetness 
          Wearing the skin of a lion, & there kept
My vigil mild while bones leached minerals 
          & cell walls ruptured. It isn't you
Curled like a seed of storm-pine in a furrow
          Of ash, but your same small jeweled hand
Belonging to a Roman matron that I see,
          Its livid reach forth the black igneous rock.
Too late to retrieve the truth, too late not to
          Have been like the alchemist who, lowered by rope
Into the volcano, feeling the sharp concussion
          Of heat, reported his own eyes saw olive groves
& sky, mountains, & rivers of water & fire.
          What can I make of this? Oh, what am I to make?





Cricket
 

Another one of those Pyrrhic experiences. Call it
an expyrrhience. A day at Lords, mostly rain,
one of those long-drawn-out draws so perplexing to Americans.

Nothing riding on the game, two mid-table counties
at the end of a disappointing season, no local rivalry or anything like that,
very few people there, the game itself going nowhere slowly

on its last morning. The deadest of dead rubbers.
Papa had his beer, but you two must have wondered what you'd done wrong.
Did I say it was raining, and the forecast was for more rain?

Riveting. A way, at best, for the English
to read their newspapers out of doors, and get vaguely shirty
or hot under the collar about something. The paper, maybe, or the rain.

Occasionally lifting their eyes to watch the groundsmen at their antics,
not just hope over experience but hope over certain knowledge.
It was like staying to watch your horse lose.

And yet there was some residual sense of good fortune to be there,
perhaps it was the fresh air or being safely out of range of conversation
or the innitesimal prospect of innitesimal entertainment.

One groundsman--the picador--mounted on a tractor,
others on foot, like an army of clowns, with buckets and besoms.
The tractor was towing a rope across the outeld to dry it--

we saw the water spray up, almost in slow motion--
as from newly cut hair. The old rope was so endearingly vieux jeu.
It approached a pile of sawdust--two failing styles of drying--

and one of the groundsmen put out his foot to casually ick it over,
as sporting a gesture as we expected to see all day
in terms of nesse, economy of movement, timing.

He missed, and instead the rope sliced right through the sawdust pile,
and attened it. A malicious laugh, widely dispersed and yet unexpectedly hearty,
went up on all sides of the ground. Soft knocks that school a lifetime--no?





Portrait dune Femme
 

The age demanded an imageof its accelerated grimace            --Ezra PoundIdiot Wind,Blowin' every time you move your teeth            --Bob Dylan
You were energized by your epoch.
The difference between a harmless nut--John Doe, Jane Doe, plain Jane, 
practically any mediocrity--standing on a beach
and the same harmless nut 
riding a wave of (now) cultural self-righteousness
about to tube. A tsunami armed with thunderbolts.
Empowered--yea, packing.

You played everything to the sympathetic studio theater
of your hearers, a chorus-cum-sounding-board.
They were your doo-wop boys and girls, 
your clique and claque and Marshall stack. The church hall chairs scraped, 
the cheap black crepe backdrop rustled "cutting edge at you.
You paid attention to how they oohed and aahed for you, 
and then pantomime hissed, and balled their sts and bayed for blood:

the half-lustful half-men betraying their half-gender 
when they weren't speculating what you were like in bed,
the frightened girls who'd never seen anything like you
but thought it might be fun (after Goth) to be a Maenad,
the Pharisaic mothers going home to their chilly res, 
their dim, furtive, put-upon husbands and their neo-feral offspring
with a "there but for the grace of God on their bony lips.

And it was all you, the decisive impulse, the focus, the leadership;
why, there was the beef, right there with its bleeding footin its mouth.
The venomous articulation with its trademark solecisms
(naive to wonder how anyone with a Cambridge degree in it 
could hurt the language like you).
A sort of chronically over-emphatic sub-style of maimed English, 
a testosterone debris of nursery babble, pop psychology, tabloid yelp and obscenity.

Strangers were helpless in its vortices, 
lawyers needless to say loved it--
what they would have given (M'lud) to be able to solicit like that. 
It was all as humdrum as gratti, vivid and appalling 
and unutterably humdrum, it was Mary Elizabeth 
Bott in the William books going 
"I'll thcweam and thwcweam and thwcweam.

It's strange, you were ungainly, but you were never wrong.
You had the yessers and nodders and eggers-on
to take care of that. Ungainliness in this instance 
happened to be the price of rightness. 
You espoused ungainliness. Worshipped it.
Ungainliness was the new duty. The new beauty. 
Disinhibition ruled. Wa-hey.

And so it somehow had to be. You did it for them. 
You erupted out of Englishness and made an exhibition of yourself.
(Tiny terremoto in Derby that I read about in Mexico, 2 point something on the Richter Scale.)
Once it might have been said where you came from youforgot yourself, 
but that style of rebuke went out of fashion. Anyway, you weren't into 
forgetting yourself. You were into remembering yourself. 
As you would have said, 24/7.

It would have been good to do smoulder like Anna Magnani
or have a wronged prole like Dante's, whoever the fuck Dante is. 
But you couldn't hack that.
So you chucked glasses and went public.
Bridget Jones thuggee. Jordan tragdienne.
The English rose goes ape. 
Deal or no deal.

You were good value at cocktail parties. For about ve minutes.
Then you were a bore; and as the good book didn't say, the bores are always with us.
You would have loved a column like Margaret Cook. (Not acooking column.)
Your mother was dead, your godmother was dead, 
look what happened to them. (They died.)
Perhaps there was something you could do, 
and so you stayed alive and humbly served the numties.





The Building of Light
 

Mauve mist-shadow cloaks the sky's
River-blurred, inchoate border.
Dawn's old story; and light tries--
Not the last time--to devise
           Lasting order;

From rst principles assigns
Laws to frame day's jurisdiction;
Drawing contours, shapes, and lines
From the nebula, it shines,
           Strange as ction.

Such designs, though, won't appear
In the plans of a committee.
Look. The moon's pale-copper sphere
Rings--a gong too faint to hear--
           Through the city.

Let them linger, unawake.
Down the mountain's wrinkled brilliance
Darkness empties like a lake.
Minted gold, house windows make
           Coins worth millions.

Both in disbelief and pride
All the buildings in the distance
On the river's farther side
Take up, as the shadows slide,
           New existence.

Shadow slides along the roof,
Past the guttering and gable,
Shrinks, and leaves the house aloof
Where the light reads out its proof
           Like a fable.






Auspices
 

In siftings of chromatic sediment
Shed by the winter hours as they decay,
With slow descent
Light settles through the lower sky in peach,
Then mauve, then pale self-abnegating gray
Against the water, now that day is spent
At Bennetts Beach,

Under the high withdrawing blueness, band
On band, like layers in a decorative
Bottle of sand,
Enclosed beneath the heavens' dome, as though
This were the perfect realm in which to live,
Preserved, unburdened by the least demand, 
Or wish, to know--

And simply be. Along the beach convene
Some silver gulls which stand around reecting
Upon the sheen
That comes and goes about their scarlet feet,
And crested terns y back and forth inspecting
The shallows for a last titbit to glean,
And lightly treat

A two-faced wind that works its way across
The metal of the sea it tries to planish
And to emboss,
While deep in its unbalanced buffetings
Gannets alternately appear and vanish,
Plunge, rise, and loft and give their heads a toss.
These things, these things . . .

What future, though, in that simplicity?
If the observer alters what's observed,
Simple to see
The brilliant creatures may not long survive
Our scrutiny. And yet, what would be served
By aeons of extravagance to be
Merely alive,

Without the knowing eye, though its regard
Should bring to light what turns the world to stone?
Does the same hard
Attention that we boast of here abound,
Or has it been and gone among the starred
Immenseness--meaning we must fare alone,
Lost where we're found?

Beyond Yacaaba Head towards the east
The colors harbored in that sediment
Have been released
And all the lower sky is banked with ash,
Dulled to gunmetal gray. In the event
The gannets, calling it a day, have ceased
Their white panache.

Only the sandhills, looking west, declare
A citrine wash that soon will vaporize
Into the air,
Like some faint exhalation breathed upon
The night, in which a ock of ibis rise,
As though they had a mind to follow where
The light has gone.

Agape
 

The night you died, I dreamed you came to camp
to hear confession from an Eagle Scout
tortured by forty years of sin and doubt.
You whispered vespers by a hissing lamp.

Handlers, allowing you to hike with me,
followed us to the Bad Axe waterfront
down a rebreak this camper used to hunt.
Through all I said you suffered silently.

I blamed the authors of my unbelief:
St. Paul, who would have deemed my love obscene,
the Jesuit who raped me as a teen,
the altar boy when I was six, the grief

of a child chucked from Eden, left for dead
by Peter's Church and all the choirs above.
In a thick Polish accent choked with love,
Te Dominus amat was all you said.





Disenchantment Bay
 

Touch and go. Our Cessna bumped the sand,
       thumped its tundra tires,
       lifted as if on wires,
banked over ice and rocked its wings to land.

We pitched our camp hard by the Hubbard's face,
       some sixty fathoms tall,
       a seven-mile-long wall
seven leagues from Yakutat, our base.

Crack! A blue serac tottered and gave.
       Stunned at the water's edge,
       we ed our vantage ledge
like oyster catchers skittering from a wave.

Separation has become my fear.
       What was does not console,
       what is, is past control--
the disembodiment that looms so near.

Detachment? So an ice cliff by the sea
       calves with a seismic crash
       of bergy bits and brash,
choking a waterway with its debris.

We clear the neap tide beach of glacial wrack,
       pace and mark the ground,
       then wave the Cessna round.
Pilot, we bank on you to bear us back.





Cullen in the Afterlife
 

He found it strange at rst. A new dimension.  
One he had never guessed. The fourth? The fth? 
How could he tell, who'd only known the third?
Something to do with eyesight, depth of eld.
Perspective quite beyond him. Everything at
or nearly at. The vanishing point 
they'd tried to teach at school was out of sight
and out of mind. A blank.

Now, this diaphanous dimension--one
with neither up nor down, nor east nor west,
nor orienting star to give him north.
Even his name had left him. Strayed like a dog. 
Yet he was bathed in some unearthly light,
a delicate no-color that made his esh
transparent, see-through, a Saran-Wrap self.
His body without substance and his mind
with nothing to think about--although intact--
was totally minus purpose. He must think.

Think of a Rubens, he said to himself. But where
Rubens had been there was a void, a vast
emptiness--no opulence. And then
Czanne who broke all matter up--
made light of it, in fact. And mad Van Gogh
who, blinded by the light, cut off his ear.
Gone--that shadowy assembly--vanished, done. 
Gone without substance. Like himself. A shell.
Insensate in a ash. (What was that ash--
bereft of all but essence?) Was it death?
He wondered about the word, so lled with breath
yet breathless, breathless, breathless. A full stop.

"Divino Espirito Santo, he had said
once in Brazil, "Soul of my very soul.
He'd prayed in Portuguese, an easier tongue--
for newly agnostic Anglos--than his own,
burdened with shibboleths and past beliefs.
"Alma de minha alma--liquid words
that made a calm within him. Where within?
Was there a word for it? Was it his heart?

Engulfed by love. Held in a healing beam
of love-light. Had he earned such love?
And how partake of such a gift when he
was handicapped by Earthshine--wore the stars,
badges and medals of privilege and success?
Desensitizers, brutalizers--all 
the tricks that mammon plays to make one sleep.

He must wake up. He must expose and strip
successive layers to nd his soul again.
Where had the rubble come from? He was like
a junkyard--cluttered, lled with scrap iron, tin.
As dead as any metal not in use. 

So he must start once more. He had begun
how many times? Faint glimmerings and dim
memories of pasts behind the past
recently lived--the animal pasts and vague
vegetable pasts--those climbing vines and fruits;
and mineral pasts (a slower pulse) the shine
of gold and silver and the gray of iron.
The "upward anguish. 
                                   What a rush of wings
above him as he thought the phrase and knew 
angels were overhead, and over them
a million suns and moons.





Win-Win
 

If an orchidophage's tastebud magnied 
resembles an orchid
so my buds indubitably mimic pricking ice cream cones.

Love, little by little it dawned on us the artisanal
ice cream, especially the prizewinning caramel, 
would be out of our reach, 
like the previous Friday of a Sunday leaving the beach, 
in the meltdown.

When you gasp at the soundle of cymbals
--"that knitting needle sound--through your headphones it kindles
an inkling that in the bongo-playing
you can hear the wedding ring,
ting ting in the liquescence.

When you hear the sound you may smile
to think of the ones and zeros of that soundle
resembling sticks and drumheads,
or knitting needles and drumheads
as the beat gets molten.

When things get molten you may think of a re
made up of a million little matchres
rendering a house on the Sound
--belonging to ex-employers--a bit of char on the ground
as the regrettable outcome of a meltdown.

A thousand hotheads make a Sarkozy:
at the sight of their BMW in a car cozy
a thousand swans make a Sigolne
purring win-win.
The Sound is statistical, like the meltdown.

The holes in your socks and the follicles in your leg
are pixelated as a JPEG.
My tastebuds resemble microscopic glasses of gin now, now's
the time to shake and shiver like a maraca in this house.
The many kinds of dissolution.

Well, birds happen forth from feeders like swinging pagodas 
against snow, as
the meltdown goes on, a dump of rock salt. 
We'll soon be signatories by default.
Crystals of sodium chloride

are made of smaller crystals of sodium chloride.
Let them know their House
is made up of many other people's houses, magnied.






Kouign Amann
 

I went to make kouign amann. It sounded Irish
and/or Maghrebi. But it's Breton, as I can swear
by the blue hydrangea like a cloudy iris

I photographed near Finistre.
And now I'm here in Croton-on-Hudson
trying to remember what was sinister

about the asymmetrical cruets,
swan and cygnet, I thought I heard
--listening under a sweet duvet--

duet. (But do swans vocalize?
Strengthening the pair-bond
while their two pasts together caramelize

the present?) Sinister like Croton's 
name, derived either from a Kitchawanc chief
or Calabria, source of stonemasons

for the dam. The former translates as
"Big Wind, the second is known 
as the birthplace of the school of Pythagoras.

Sinister not knowing if silent esoterics lter
down to our little dam, dreamt of under
sweet sweet down duvets. Bretagne's off-kilter

menhirs call to our bric-a-brac rock
like names orphaned after the glaciers' retreat
from Briquebec to Wequetequock.






Big City Speech
 

Use me
Abuse me
          Turn wheels of re

Sing me
Sour me
          Secrete dark matter's sheen

          somnambulists and sleepyheads

                               and cab-top numbers squinting in the mist





Sales
 

Miguel might, if he speaks English, call the colors
of ukuleles stretching their necks from yards
of canvas duffel yoked across his shoulders,
auroral azul, cherry pop, or mojito green,
under this Pac Heights sky where the awful rich
snap their heels past shop windows, past goatskin bags
and spiked heels that bring them closer to heaven,
bristic sheets of celadon paper from Zhejiang,
FIAT cremini, and Cinco de Mayo gelato.
Smiling past them, he passes with his happy load,
a display model whole and nude in his hand,
on sale to no one, uplifted like a Stratocaster
sacramental from mahogany forests in Paraguay.





Having My Cards Read
 

Hobos wail a garbage can against
the cyclone links. The monkey puzzle tree
droops its scaly tails above our heads
as she sets up near the zoo's bonobos,
humping happy in their cages close
to chimps ripping off each other's ears.
And in the cloud reposing on the sky,
cut by an F22's long hookah puffs,
the cyan atmospherics rupture into
solarized platelets: her Ray-Bans foil
my own face back at me:
                                  A time of renewals
            though somewhere
                         dark cold woe
                                   You won't know what's what
Comes a taste of sea to make her pause,
and marine gusts slice and spook her cards, my cards,
that urry to the sidewalk, near the barred gate,
breaking fortune down faster as she speaks.





Tulips
 

The tulips make me want to paint,
Something about the way they drop
Their petals on the tabletop
And do not wilt so much as faint,

Something about their burnt-out hearts,
Something about their pallid stems
Wearing decay like diadems,
Parading nishes like starts,

Something about the way they twist
As if to catch the last applause,
And drink the moment through long straws,
And how, tomorrow, they'll be missed.

The way they're somehow getting clearer,
The tulips make me want to see--
The tulips make the other me
(The backwards one who's in the mirror,

The one who can't tell left from right),
Glance now over the wrong shoulder
To watch them get a little older
And give themselves up to the light.





The Mothers Loathing of Balloons
 

I hate you,
How the children plead
At rst sight--

I want, I need,
I hate how nearly 
Always I

At rst say no,
And then comply.
(Soon, soon

They will grow bored
Clutching your 
Umbilical cord)--

Over the moon,
Lighter-than-air,
Should you come home,

They'd cease to care--
Who tugs you through
The front door

On a leash, won't want you
Anymore
And will forget you

On the ceiling--
Admittedly,
A giddy feeling--

Later to nd you,
Puckered, small,
Crouching low

Against the wall.
O thin-of-skin
And t to burst,

You break for her
Who wants you worst.
Your forebear was

The sack of the winds,
The boon that gives
And then rescinds,

Containing nothing
But the force
That blows everyone

Off course.
Once possessed,
Your one chore done,

You oat like happiness
To the sun,
Untethered afternoon,

Unkind,
Marooning all
You've left behind:

Their tinfoil tears,
Their plastic cries,
Their wheedling

And moot goodbyes,
You shrug them off--
You do not heed--

O loose bloom
             With no root
                              No seed.





A Marriage in the Dolomites
 

We communicated by cheeses,
unwrapping them gingerly,
parting the crust with a fork,
tasting dew, must, salt,
raising an eyebrow,

or we let chianti talk for us,
rolling it in the glass,
staring--it was dark and shiny
as the pupil, and stared back--
or we undressed each other;

we took long walks hand in hand
in the vineyards, the pastures,
resenting each other bitterly
for our happiness that excluded us
as surely as the world did,
mountain after mountain.





The Simulacra
 

They were driving into the mountains, suddenly married,
sometimes touching each other's cheek with a ngernail
gingerly: the radio played ecstatic static: certain roads
marked with blue enamel numbers led to cloud banks,
or basalt screes, or dim hotels with padlocked verandas.
Sometimes they quarreled, sometimes they grew old,
the wind was constant in their eyes, it was their own wind,
they made it. Small towns ew past, Rodez, Albi,
limestone quarries, pear orchards, children racing
after hoops, wobbling when their shadows wavered,
infants crying for ne rain, old women on stoops
darning gray veils--and who were we, watching?
Doubles, ghosts, the ones who would tell of the eld
where they pulled over, bluish tinge of the elms, steepness
of the other's eyes, glowworm hidden in its own glint,
how the rain was twilight and now is darkness.





"Unreal precision of the houses...
 

Unreal precision of the houses at rst light
45 years of rain and bodice
Grasses woods wildowers
To be the only woman at this hour
Out in it one beauty one movie
And I am her hapless mule

Out of the blue one morning
My father took me north upriver
To see the mothball eet
His war aoat and ghostly
Pennants of rain hanging from each spar
It's what we are

Discards of memory
Unreal until the only woman wakes





"Some motionless conict in the sky...
 

Some motionless conict in the sky
As of Milton's angels painted there
In all their radiance and red malice

It is a special happiness and universal
Simply to know the names of colors
And to see them said

She mixed the colors for house painters
That was Binghamton Rochester Indianapolis
I'll take less luck if it means less stink she said

A special happiness 
When clouds contest with clouds 
In xed amboyance

Good versus Evil or beautiful cold hair
God loosed angels on us and they are the air





"Birds small enough...
 

Birds small enough to nest in our young cypress
Are physicians to us

They burst from the tree exactly
Where the mind ends and the eye sees

Another world the equal of this one
Though only a small boy naked in the sun

Glad day glad day I was born
Sparrow hatted old New York

And the physician who brought me 
Drowned under sail next day in a calm sea

There are birds small enough to live forever
Where the mind ends and where

My love and I once planted a cypress
Which is God to us





Day and Night in Virginia and Boston
 

After three months, Virginia is still a frontier.
Late at night, I close the door
on my husband practicing Mozart, the dishpan fills
and the network affiliates sign off one by one.
Now the country stations, tuning up like crickets
on radios in scattered valley kitchens:
Har yall this evenin folks!
(Wanting to say I'm real fine' I whisper Wow.')
Got your Green Hill chicory perkin'? An army
of women, straightened and ironed and blued
like Picasso's ironer--jerking coffeecups
back with one gesture, hips pressed to sinks.
Their suspendered husbands are reading--the paper? the Bible?
And it's Jesus for you and for me, till midnight--the anthem--
and one soaped hand jerks out, and their lighted lives recede
to kitchens on the moon's dark side, Mozart rising . . .
Daytimes, in post office, gas station, greasy spoon,
I don't see them anywhere, it makes me nervous.
Black faces down here look "colored.
I am afraid of the other, red faces.

Take my first job in Boston,
the outgoing typist said, You've got
to know the foms, we use so many foms.'
And I said O why farms?
I thought law firms had torts.
A tort, I thought, was like vous avez tort.
But I was wrong about the farms,
and after the Cardinal's Vietnam speech
one of the girls said, Think you're smat with that accent?'

Still, nothing soothes me, sometimes,
like American voices, softened with distance,
with nearness, as murmurs in a darkened Greyhound:
It sure has been a scorcher.' Where you folks from?'
I keep yawning, lightworlds off in the dark . . .
Sometimes my lonesome standard English sleeps:
The varied and ample land, the North and South in the light,
and the voices of Earth and Moon swell in my helmet
with prairie inflections, soft twangs of outer speech--
You're looking real good,' says Earth
--ain't that somethin'?'
Roger. No sweat. Out.'





A Little Called Pauline
 

          
          A little called anything shows shudders. Come and say what prints all day. A whole few watermelon. There is no pope. No cut in pennies and little dressing and choose wide soles and little spats really little spices. A little lace makes boils. This is not true. Gracious of gracious and a stamp a blue green white bow a blue green lean, lean on the top. If it is absurd then it is leadish and nearly set in where there is a tight head. A peaceful life to arise her, noon and moon and moon. A letter a cold sleeve a blanket a shaving house and nearly the best and regular window. Nearer in fairy sea, nearer and farther, show white has lime in sight, show a stitch of ten. Count, count more so that thicker and thicker is leaning. I hope she has her cow. Bidding a wedding, widening received treading, little leading mention nothing. Cough out cough out in the leather and really feather it is not for. Please could, please could, jam it not plus more sit in when.
        




The Armada
 

Through the meridian's fine blue hairlines, the admirals are converging
in their fish-hulled ships, with their frogmen and sirens, and tanks with knotted chain flails
that beat the ground before them as they crawl.

Behind them the cities dim out, on the foredeck the admirals sigh
to lean from the curving bows, to trail
their fingertips in the water . . .

All alone on the landmass, the Ship's Artist simply draws what he sees:
red men with arms like flesh clubs, blue-daubed men with parasol feet
and fish with weeping human faces. The sonic boom arrives at his feet

in the palest ripples. In the painting, Gloriana rides under arms
towards Tilbury Town. Her profile shimmers in the sodium lights
that seem to cast no shadows before or behind her.

Like compass pencils of light, their fingertips spread out
the nervous systems more complex than spiral nebulae.
Orchards of mines grow up on the ocean floor.

Now under radar they study the green road glowing
and add a late-rising moon. The sea so full of maprooms, and the cliffs
chalked with weaponry symbols, trailing the phosphorescence of minesquads.

Only the grassblown Norman ringmounds go on dreaming
of Monet picture hats and streaming scarves,
the bunker disguised as a picnic, that went on forever.

Now the Cathedral at Bayeux, with its window and views, is rolled up
and the Conqueror's navy on its blue worsted waves
and Hengist and Horsa, the Escorial with its green shoals of ships, all are safely rolled up.

Behind the Atlantic Wall, that Rommel called "Cloud-Cuckoo-Land, the white-and-liver-cows
moo through the milky light. The human faces carved
on Norman beams face out to the sea, which has grown

this answering forest of rigging. And very soon, just as soon
as the sea can see the land and the land the sea
the two of them will go to war.





The Depot
 

Sparrows tapping your shutters louvres? snow owls
guano your eaves? Spring rainstorms sway
in your gutters; down-cellar a green pipe pearls

and roots find its fissures. Matter--outside us, out in le Vrai,
matter--un-does; fatiscit; a sort of eternal
breakdown and sloughage. Small wonder that Saturday

finds you botanizing some mast-high aisle
in the Depot. Fazed by stock-names and numbers, distinctions
like drip-forged and molly- and carborundum-steel,

or, in DIMENSIONAL LUMBER, the trunk chart. Its dotted lines
follow core cuts, mere spindles, out to the perimeter or "wane,
a ring of two-by-twelves with moonrim bark ribbons.

Yet even sparrows must nest-mend with worldstuff torn
out of somewhere. The joinery-bits in the MASTER JOINER
blister-pack point to his fast parataxes--copulas, common-

alities, ship-lists, figures in carpets or slimmer
hex-keys in sets, the eternal angle (Egyptian)
or iron plane-handles tuned to the unheard rumor

that joins them. The same slits reparied once with tendon-
thread in bone needles, bronze pins, the earliest factory-fittings
or the long floating line of the bass-baritone

Leporello, his catlogo of continents and couplings
ironizing, admiring, down to the final mel-
isma on DOES (you know the Don's doings)

voi . . . sapete, voi . . . sapete . . . quel
che FA-AHH, ah-ahh, ah-ahh . . . Ah vowel
that winds through the world like a wind or a dowel,

you make us a clean dream of matter. Electrons wheel
translucent in orbit, sealants in lucid spheres fall
to our refts and rifts, you grout tubs and re-seal

turved huts in the rainy Carpathians where the Baal
Shem Tov ("the world is a wedding) lingers, and back to our own vernal
mall. You float like a bird through the darkening hall

of the Depot, cooling the brows of nocturnal
plasterers trailing meanders of lime-white prints
under parking-lot lights, past crepuscular forklifts, feral

carhoods streaming the fractalized shadows of chain links
and sledges laden with wattles, with yellowy rolls of oiled paper
to seal up the windows of snowy Muscovy or Minsk.





Prodigal
 

You could drive out of this country
and attack the world with your ambition,
invent wonder plasmas,
become an artist of the provocative gesture,
the suggestive nod, you could leave
wanting the world and return
carrying it, a noisy bundle
of steam and libido, a ball of fire
balanced on your tongue,
you might reclaim Main Street in a limo
longer than a sermon, wave at our red faces
while remembering that you were born
a clod hopper, a farmer's kid,
and get over that hump once and for all
by telling A Great Man's stories--
the dirty jokes of dictators, tidbits
of presidential hygiene, insights
into the psychotropic qualities of power
and the American tradition of kissing
moneyed ass. Your uncle would still
call you Roy Boy, pheasants
sun themselves beside the tracks,
waiting for the dew to burn off
before their first flight, and corn
grow so high that if you stood 
in the field you'd disappear, the fact
aiming your eyes down the road.





Duke
 

He was hit back of the head for a haul of $15,
a Diner's Club Card and picture of his daughter in a helmet
on a horse tethered to a pole that centered
its revolving universe. Pacing the halls, he'd ask

for a blow job he didn't want. The ward's new visitors
didn't know this request was all the injury
had left him to say, and would be shamed or pissed,
a few hitting him as he stood with his mouth

slightly open and large frame leaning in. His wife
divorced him for good and blameless reasons. He would not
be coming home to share his thoughts on film and weather,
or remembering her any longer than it took to leave a room.

He liked ham. Kept newspapers in drawers and under his bed,
each unread page hand-pressed flat. And when it snowed
he leaned into one of the sealed, unbreakable windows,
a cheek to the cool glass as he held his fingers

over his mouth and moaned low and constant like the sound
of a boat on the far side of a lake. When he died
they cut him open to see how his habits had been rewired
and so tightly looped. Having known him they were afraid

of what can happen when you cross the lot to the office
or pull up to a light and thump the wheel as you might
any hour. If you stare at the dyed
and beautiful cross sections of a brain, it's natural

to wonder how we extract the taste of coffee
or sense of a note accurately found and held on an oboe
from this bramble. On Duke's slides they circled
the regions of blight which explain

why almost all behavior we recognize as human was lost,
but not why a man who'd curl into a ball
like a caterpillar when barely touched, could only ask
for sex, for intimacy, for the very thing

he could least accept and lived twelve years without,
no embrace or caress, no kiss on the lips before sleep,
until he died in the lounge looking out on winter sky
that seemed eager to snow all day but didn't.





Man of the House
 

It was a misunderstanding.
I got into bed, made love
with the woman I found there,
called her honey, mowed the lawn,
had three children, painted 
the house twice, fixed the furnace,
overcame an addiction to blue pills,
read Spinoza every night
without once meeting his God,
buried one child, ate my share
of Jell-o and meatloaf,
went away for nine hours a day
and came home hoarding my silence,
built a ferris wheel in my mind,
bolt by bolt, then it broke
just as it spun me to the top.
Turns out I live next door.





Summer
 

        As the morning advanced the sun became bright and warm, cloudless, calm, serene. About nine an appearance very unusual began to demand our attention--a shower of cobwebs falling from very elevated regions, & continuing, without any interruption, till the close of the day . . .



       There is a natural occurrence to be met with upon the highest part of our down in hot summer days, and that is a loud audible humming of bees in the air, though not one insect is to be seen . . .



       In a district so diversified as this, so full of hollow vales and hanging woods, it is no wonder that echoes should abound. Many we have discovered that return a tunable ring of bells, or the melody of birds; but we were still at a loss for a polysyllabical, articulate echo, till a young gentleman, who had parted from his company in a summer walk, and was calling after them, stumbled upon a very curious one in a spot where it might least be expected . . .



       We procured a cuckoo, and cutting open the breastbone and exposing the intestines to sight, found the crop lying as mentioned above. This stomach was large and round, and stuffed hard, like a pincushion, with food, which upon nice examination, we found to consist of various insects, such as small scarabs, spiders, and dragon-flies; the last of which, as they were just emerging out of the aurelia state, we have seen cuckoos catching on the wing. Among this farrago also were to be seen maggots, and many seeds, which belonged either to gooseberries, currants, cranberries, or some such fruit . . .



       All nature is so full, that that district produces the greatest variety which is the most examined . . .


                                                                                                    Gilbert White



1
Upon First Opening a Cuckoo


I saw the sweet-briar & bon-fire & strawberry wire now

relaxed into intricate thicket.

It was as if seen in strong sunlight, flat


& tapestried, all edge & definition. Here, an airy bone shaped

like a plowshare, there, vibratory membranes within a space


from which the song must come: a syrinx (hollow

pipes of reeds) now silent


in return to the Salliter' of earth.


Little more than

a drift of air, brought


into form by plumes.


Mulch to stone.

Yeast of the clouds.





2
What the Earth Told Me


No surface is allowed to be bare,

& nothing to stand still. A man could forever study a pebble

& at last see dilations & expansions of the hills--

to pull the most slender stalk, is to jostle the stars,

& between the bearded grass

& man looking in the vegatable glass

of Nature', is a network of roots & suckers

fine as hairs.

I threw a stone upon a pond

& it bounded the surface, its circles interlacing


& radiating out to the most ephemeral edge.


Flint & Mica, Lichened Limestone, Shale & Sarcens, Sandstone, Soil.


I saw the wind moving on a meadow

& the meadows moving under wind--

lifting,   settling   &   accumulating.


Flint  &  Mica,  Lichened  Limestone,


Shale  &  Sarcens,  Sandstone,  Soil.




3
What the Air Told Me


It is breathed into Orpheus' lyre & as rocks & trees & beasts

is divided there. Its origins strain


precedes the sound, by as much as echoes follow after:

the quivering of cow-quake', a loud audible

humming of bees on the down', stresses within the sustaining earth,

clouds of fleece & mare's tail.


I saw with single eye, the facet of the fly--

the infinitesimal mechanics & all the metallic sheens

of a blue-bottle. In a land where the sun grows fat on cloud

& summer hasn't come

till your foot can cover twenty daisies,


she came to the dark, open beak

& laid a myriad of eggs. And in two day's time the dead

bird's body simulated life: maggots in eye-socket &

under feather, in a subtle movement.


The White & The Glistening.




4
What the Leaf Told Me


Today I saw the word written on the poplar leaves.

It was dazzle'. The dazzle of the poplars.

As a leaf startles out


from an undifferentiated mass of foliage,

so the word did from a leaf--


A Mirage Of The Delicate Polyglot

inventing itself as cipher. But this, in shifts & gyrations,

grew in brightness, so bright


the massy poplars soon outshone the sun . . .


My light--my dews--my breezes--my bloom'. Reflections


In A Wren's Eye.




5
De Vegetabilibus


For there are splendors of flowers called DAY'S EYES in every field.

For one cannot walk but to walk upon sun.

For the sun has also a stem, on which it turns.


For the tree forms sun into leaves, & its branches & saps

are solid & liquid states of sun.

For the sun has many seasons, & all of them summer.


For the carrot & bee both bless with sun,

the carrot beneath the earth & the bee with its dusts & honies


For the sun has stippled the pear & polished the apple.




6
De Animalibus


For there are owls in the air & moles in the earth

& THEY ALSO have eyes.


For there are shapes of air which are OWL

& shapes of earth which are MOLE,

& the moles brings air to the earth & the owl, earth into air.


For the turtle's back is another firmament & dappled like the cloud.

For there are birds who nest on the earth

& are feathered in its form.

For the rook & the worm are only one cycle out of many.


For man rejoices with rook & worm

& owl & mole & turtle,

& they are only one cycle out of many.

Turner, Constable & Stubbs


To see,Turner had himself lashed to the ship's mast

& Constable sat still in the fields

till something came--a bird--some living thing appropriate to

the place'. He noted the wind's direction, pile

of clouds, the time of day. Stubbs

fixed an iron bar to the ceiling of his room, with hooks

of various sizes & lengths, in order to suspend the body of a horse.

The horse remained for six or seven weeks

until no longer endurable'.

The form of muscles, blood vessels & nerves was retained

by tallow injections--Stubbs methodically

cutting to the skeleton, making full length drawings

& studies of the ear & nose.

He was possessed of great physical

strength, being able,

it is said, to carry a dead horse on his back

to a dissecting room,

at the top of a narrow flight of stairs'.


The work was finished in eighteen months.




8
Natural Productions, Occurrences & Antiquities


August is by much the most mute month', yet,

the air may be so strongly electric

that bells may ring & sparks be discharged in their clappers:


put a bird in motion, et vera incessu patuit . . .'

To distinguish a bird by its air', to hear'

the buoyant owls--woodpeckers rising & falling in curves

--the perpendicularity of skylarks . . .


Gilbert White quotes from the Latin: He preferred

the sounds of birds to those of men. The music of men left his mind

disturbed by engaging his attention

with its rise & fall, while the warbling

of birds left no such hold

to tease my imagination & recur irresistibly

at seasons . . . '


All day the cobweb fell silently

in the air, till whole

baskets-full lay round about, & still


more descending.

The Leaves of Southwell


Maple & hawthorn & oak. Crow-foot & cinquefoil
(Aubrey's Midsummer Silver?).

Vine & ivy & hops. Rose, bryony (a Mandrake), geranium, mulberry,
wormwood. Fig, bittersweet & blackthorn.

It is an assemblage (a community?) including its dragons with
crisply carved acorns.

Two hounds devour a hare. A bird seizes a grape with its
beak. Both green men & the winged

fruit of maple are in hierarchy of accuracy--the ribbed & the delicate
ascending to the general. But here, a throat

come aleaf, there a branch held aloft.
And a kind of greening speech comes from those mouths

all but winged--each leaf
cleft & articulate. Southwell, of the leaves



of limestone: trefoil, quatrefoil, cinquefoil (as foil means
leaf): a burnisht corall' & geranium

brain: cranesbill, crow-foot: blackthorn & whitehorn,
quickthorn, Jack-in-the-green:

a man cleft, as Mandrakes, the man-shaped
dragon', Mandragora.

Exhibit from Frederik Ruysch's Anatomical Museum


A skeleton balances an injected spermatic plexus
in one hand & a coil of viscera
in the other. Minatory assortments

of calculi of all sizes
occupy the foreground. In the rear, a
variety of injected vessels, backed by an inflated & injected

tunica vaginalis,
combined to form a grotesque & arboreal
perspective. Another skeleton,

in extremis, is grasping a skeleton
of that emblem of insect mortality, the mayfly, & a third
is performing

a composition expressing the sorrows of mankind'
on a violin, symbolized
by bundles of arteries & a fragment

of necrotic femur.
Bones are arranged to represent
a cemetery--wrists are adorned with organic & injected

frills--& human, comparative
& pathological exhibts
are mingled, as the exigencies of space required.




11
Unless the Humming of a Gnat is as the Music of the Spheres


& the music of the spheres is as the humming

of a gnat . . . ' A spectre came, transparent-winged,


out of the interstices of light,


& shadow went up like smoke & everywhere

the hills were as clouds over valleys of water, rippling

& reverberating.


And before him the sands of the beach swarmed as insects, close-knit

in electrical flight . . .

For MATTER is the dust of the Earth,


every atom of which is the life.


For the flames of fire may be blown thro musical pipes'.


And everywhere the hills were as clouds over

valleys of water, rippling


& reverberating.




12
What the Light Told Me


It is now a circle, now a spiral or wheel.

It merges with the eye, with a wing or a sickle-shaped horn.

It takes on the form of beasts--a dragon, fish, or bird.

As an orb, at summer soltice,
it balances on the altar-stone at Stonehenge--

& as beam, expands, elongates, twists & attenuates
itself into leafen gold
as a covering for the quince'.


With arc & parabolic
& serpent-oblique--muscial in ocular
harmony'. Expanding, elongating, twisting
& attenuating.


An encompassing eye.
Within and out, round as a ball--
With hither and thither, as straight as a line.
Slight as a fox-whisker,
spiraled, twined--rayed as chicory-flower.


Within and out, round as a ball--
With hither and thither, as straight as a line.
With lily, germander
And sops-in-wine. With sweet-briar and
Bon-fire and strawberry wire
And columbine.





Aphrodite Metropolis (2)
 

Harry loves Myrtle--He has strong arms, from the warehouse,
And on Sunday when they take the bus to emerald meadows he doesn't say:
"What will your chastity amount to when your flesh withers in a little while?"
No,
On Sunday, when they picnic in emerald meadows they look at the Sunday paper:
GIRL SLAYS BANKER-BETRAYER
They spread it around on the grass
BATH-TUB STIRS JERSEY ROW
And then they sit down on it, nice.
Harry doesn't say "Ziggin's Ointment for withered flesh,
Cures thousands of men and women of moles, warts, red veins, flabby throat, scalp and hair diseases,
Not expensive, and fully guaranteed."
No,
Harry says nothing at all,
He smiles,
And they kiss in the emerald meadows on the Sunday paper.





Aphrodite Metropolis (1)
 

"Myrtle loves Harry"--It is sometimes hard to remember a thing like that,
Hard to think about it, and no one knows what to do with it when he has it,
So write it out on a billboard that stands under the yellow light of an "L" platform among popcorn wrappers and crushed cigars,
A poster that says "Mama I Love Crispy Wafers So."
Leave it on a placard where somebody else gave the blonde lady a pencil moustache, and another perplexed citizen deposited:
"Jesus Saves. Jesus Saves."
One can lay this bundle down there with the others,
And never lose it, or forget it, or want it.
"Myrtle loves Harry."
They live somewhere.





Q & A
 

Where analgesia may be found to ease the infinite, minute scars of the day;
What final interlude will result, picked bit by bit from the morning's hurry, the lunch-hour boredom, the fevers of the night;
Why this one is cherished by the gods, and that one not;
How to win, and win again, and again, staking wit alone against a sea of time;
Which man to trust and, once found, how far--

Will not be found in Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John,
Nor Blackstone, nor Gray's, nor Dun & Bradstreet, nor Freud, nor Marx,
Nor the sage of the evening news, nor the corner astrologist, nor in any poet,

Nor what sort of laughter should greet the paid pronouncements of the great,
Nor what pleasure the mulitudes have, brining lunch and the children to watch the condemned to be plunged into death,

Nor why the sun should rise tomorrow,
Nor how the moon still weaves upon the ground, through the leaves, so much silence and so much peace.





X Minus X
 

Even when your friend, the radio, is still; even when her dream, the magazine, is finished; even when his life, the ticker, is silent; even when their destiny, the boulevard, is bare;
And after that paradise, the dance-hall, is closed; after that theater, the clinic, is dark,

Still there will be your desire, and hers, and his hopes and theirs,
Your laughter, their laughter,
Your curse and his curse, her reward and their reward, their dismay and his dismay and her dismay and yours--

Even when your enemy, the collector, is dead; even when your counsellor, the salesman, is sleeping; even when your sweetheart, the movie queen, has spoken; even when your friend, the magnate, is gone.

But that dashing, dauntless, delphic, diehard, diabolic cracker likes his fiction turned with a certain elegance and wit; and that anti-anti-anti-slum-congestion clublady prefers romance;
Search through the mothballs, comb the lavender and lace;
Were her desires and struggles futile or did an innate fineness bring him at last to a prouder, richer peace in a world gone somehow mad?

We want one more compelling novel, Mr. Filbert Sopkins Jones,
All about it, all about it,
With signed testimonials to its stark, human while-u-wait, iced-or-heated, taste-that-sunshine tenderness and truth;
One more comedy of manners, Sir Warwick Aldous Wells, involving three blond souls; tried in the crucible of war, Countess Olga out-of-limbo by Hearst through the steerage peerage,
Glamorous, gripping, moving, try it, send for a 5 cent, 10 cent sample, restores faith in the flophouse, workhouse, warehouse, whorehouse, bughouse life of man,
Just one more long poem that sings a more heroic age, baby Edwin, 58,

But the faith is all gone,
And all the courage is gone, used up, devoured on the first morning of a home relief menu,
You'll have to borrow it from the picket killed last Tuesday on the fancy knitgoods line;
And the glamor, the ice for the cocktails, the shy appeal, the favors for the subdeb ball? O.K.,
O.K.,
But they smell of exports to the cannibals,
Reek of something blown away from the muzzle of a twenty-inch gun;

Lady, the demand is for a dream that lives and grows and does not fade when the midnight theater special pulls out on track 15;
Cracker, the demand is for a dream that stands and quickens and does not crumble when a General Motors dividend is passed;
Lady, the demand is for a dream that lives and grows and does not die when the national guardsmen fix those cold, bright bayonets;
Cracker, the demand is for a dream that stays, grows real, withstands the benign, afternoon vision of the clublady, survives the cracker's evening fantasy of honor, and profit, and grace.





St. Agnes' Eve
 

The dramatis personae include a fly-specked Monday evening,
   A cigar store with stagnant windows,
   Two crooked streets,
   Six policemen and Louie Glatz.
Bass drums mumble and mutter an ominous portent
   As Louie Glatz holds up the cigar store and backs out with
$14.92.
Officer Dolan noticed something suspicious, it is supposed,
   And ordered him to halt,
   But dangerous, handsome, cross-eye'd Louie the rat
Spoke with his gat,
   Rat-a-tat-tat--
   Rat-a-tat-tat
   And Dolan was buried as quickly as possible.
But Louie didn't give a good god damn,
   He ran like a crazy shadow on a shadowy street
   With five policemen off that beat
   Hot on his trail, going Blam! Blam!-blam!
While rat-a-tat-tat
   Rat-a-tat-tat
   Said Louie's gat,
So loud that Peter Wendotti rolled away from his wife,
   Got out of bed to scratch his stomach and shiver on the cold floor
   Listening to the stammering syllables of instant death
   Met on secret floors in the big vacant galleries of night.
Then Louie sagged and fell and ran.
   With seven bullets through his caved-in skull and those feeble brains
   Spilling out like soup.
   He crawled behind a water-hydrant and stood them off another half minute.
"I'm not shot," he yelled, "I'm not shot," he screamed, "it isn't me they've shot in the head," he laughed, "Oh
I don't give a damn!"
   And rat-a-tat-tat
   Rat-a-tat-tat
   Muttered the gat
   Of Louie the rat,
   While the officers of the law went Blam! Blam!-blam!
Soft music. Violins moan like weeds swaying far under water.
   The vibrant throats of steam-ships hoot a sad defiance at distance and nothing.
   Space curls its arm across the flat roofs and dreary streets.
   Bricks bulge and sag.
Louie's soul arose through his mouth in the form of a derby hat
   That danced with cigarette butts and burned matches and specks of dust
   Where Louie sprawled.
   Close-up of Dolan's widow. Of Louie's mother.
   Picture of the fly-specked Monday evening and fade out slow.





Ballad of the Salvation Army
 

On Fourteenth street the bugles blow, 
   Bugles blow, bugles blow.
The red, red, red, red banner floats
Where sweating angels split their throats,
Marching in burlap petticoats,
   Blow, bugles, blow.

God is a ten car Bronx express,
   Red eyes round, red eyes round.
"Oh where is my lustful lamb tonight,
His hair slicked down and his trousers tight?
I'll grind him back to my glory light!"
   Roll, subway, roll.

Heaven is a free amusement park,
   Big gold dome, big gold dome.
Movies at night: "The life she led."
Everyone sleeps in one big bed.
The stars go around inside your head.
   Home, sweet home.

On Fourteenth street the bugles blow,
   Bugles blow, bugles blow,
The torpid stones and pavements wake,
A million men and street-cars quake
In time with angel breasts that shake,
   Blow, bugles, blow!

1-2-3 was the number he played but today the number came 3-2-1;
   bought his Carbide at 30 and it went to 29; had the favorite at Bowie but the track was slow--

O, executive type, would you like to drive a floating power, knee-action, silk-upholstered six? Wed a Hollywood star? Shoot the course in 58? Draw to the ace, king, jack?
   O, fellow with a will who won't take no, watch out for three cigarettes on the same, single match; O democratic voter born in August under Mars, beware of liquidated rails--

Denouement to denouement, he took a personal pride in the certain, certain way he lived his own, private life, 
   but nevertheless, they shut off his gas; nevertheless, the bank foreclosed; nevertheless, the landlord called; nevertheless, the radio broke,

And twelve o'clock arrived just once too often,
   just the same he wore one gray tweed suit, bought one straw hat, drank one straight Scotch, walked one short step, took one long look, drew one deep breath,
   just one too many,

And wow he died as wow he lived,
   going whop to the office and blooie home to sleep and biff got married and bam had children and oof got fired,
   zowie did he live and zowie did he die,

With who the hell are you at the corner of his casket, and where the hell we going on the right-hand silver knob, and who
the hell cares walking second from the end with an American Beauty wreath from why the hell not,

Quivira
 

I

                 Also reputed to be golden, Quivira:


Cibola, unknown
to Coronado, meant buffalo'

to the Indians, but onward, to El Dorado, The Gilded One',


a country where
boats were incrusted with gold, where
golden bells hung from trees


(tho the food there,

                            said to be served on gold,



was buffalo).





  We took the hump from both sides of the hump ribs, of all the carcasses.  In taking out the hump we inserted the knife at the coupling of the loin, cutting forward down the lower side, as far forward as the perpendicular ribs ran; then, starting at the loin again, would cut down the upper side, thus taking out a strip from a full-grown animal about three feet long.  Near the front of the hump ribs it would be ten or twelve inches wide & four or five inches thick.  When first taken out it was hung up for a couple of days with the big end down.  It became shrunken, tender & brittle, with no taint.  The front end had a streak of lean alternating with fat & when fried in tallow, made a feast for the gods'.



                 The prairie soil was black & fat' &,

                 according to Castaneda, the marrow of the land.

On that soil, later to be stripped
for prairie sod-houses,

wild turkeys
flocked among the persimmons

their flesh succulent from golden sand plums,
bitter

with china-berries.
The coyotes,

their eyes aglow on the dark horizon, barked at a moon
above the lowing

of buffalo, heard twenty miles
away.

And cottonwood trees, from whose buds
the Indians

made clear yellow, scattered their drift in spring
filling the gullies.



                        The Quivirans
                        were to tell Coranado

                        the things
                        where you are now

                        are of great importance'.




II

As Coronado turned to retrace his steps,
the Smoky Hills were visible north across a stream
enveloped in an atmospheric haze
in which the hills
became distant, impossible mountains--

where you are now'

the Indians had said, of great

importance'.


                  The country they traveled over
                  was so level,
                  if one looked at the buffalo

                  the sky could be seen between their legs,

                  so that at a distance they appeared
                  to be smooth-trunked pines whose tops jointed--

                  & if there was
                  one bull, it seemed four
                  pines.

                  The country was round, as if
                  a man should imagine himself in a bowl, & could see sky
                  at its edge

                  an arrow's shot away.

                  And if any man
                  were to lie down on his back, he lost

                  sight
                  of the ground.


Did Coronado see also in that late summer storm,
before he turned south,
an horizon of dark funnels tapering
toward the earth, coming with the thunderous sound of a buffalo herd
out of the plains--a calm & sulphurous air
in which clouds were drawn like lightning toward the funnels--
scattering his men
to hide among grassy hollows?


A tornado against the sky
like buffalo

who were beared as
goats,

with the hump of a camel, the mane
of a lion

& who carried
their tails erect as they ran,

like any European
scorpion.

O Coronado, all country
is round to

those who lose sight of the
ground.

           Canceas, Cansez, Kansies, Konza: the Indian word

           meaning smoky,

                                   from an atmospheric condition

           in the fall of the year, called

           Indian Summer:

smoke in the air,

in Quivira.





Sonnet: On Receiving a Letter Informing Me of the Birth of a Son
 

When they did greet me Father, sudden Awe
Weigh'd down my spirit! I retired and knelt
Seeking the throne of grace, but inly felt
No heavenly visitation upwards draw
My feeble mind, nor cheering ray impart.
Ah me! before the Eternal Sire I brought
The unquiet silence of confused Thought
And shapeless feelings: my o'erwhelmed Heart
Trembled: & vacant tears stream'd down my face.
And now once more, O Lord! to thee I bend,
Lover of souls! and groan for future grace,
That, ere my Babe youth's perilous maze have trod,
Thy overshadowing Spirit may descend
And he be born again, a child of God!





To Her Father with Some Verses
 

Most truly honoured, and as truly dear,
If worth in me or ought I do appear,
Who can of right better demand the same
Than may your worthy self from whom it came?
The principal might yield a greater sum,
Yet handled ill, amounts but to this crumb;
My stock's so small I know not how to pay,
My bond remains in force unto this day;
Yet for part payment take this simple mite,
Where nothing's to be had, kings loose their right.
Such is my debt I may not say forgive,
But as I can, I'll pay it while I live;
Such is my bond, none can discharge but I,
Yet paying is not paid until I die.





To My Father on His Birthday
 

Amidst the days of pleasant mirth,
That throw their halo round our earth;
Amidst the tender thoughts that rise
To call bright tears to happy eyes;
Amidst the silken words that move
To syllable the names we love;
There glides no day of gentle bliss
More soothing to the heart than this!
No thoughts of fondness e'er appear
More fond, than those I write of here!
No name can e'er on tablet shine,
My father! more beloved than thine!
'Tis sweet, adown the shady past,
A lingering look of love to cast--
Back th' enchanted world to call,
That beamed around us first of all;
And walk with Memory fondly o'er
The paths where Hope had been before--
Sweet to receive the sylphic sound
That breathes in tenderness around,
Repeating to the listening ear
The names that made our childhood dear--
For parted Joy, like Echo, kind,
Will leave her dulcet voice behind,
To tell, amidst the magic air,
How oft she smiled and lingered there.






On Imagination
 

Thy various works, imperial queen, we see,
    How bright their forms! how deck'd with pomp by thee!
Thy wond'rous acts in beauteous order stand,
And all attest how potent is thine hand.

    From Helicon's refulgent heights attend,
Ye sacred choir, and my attempts befriend:
To tell her glories with a faithful tongue,
Ye blooming graces, triumph in my song.

    Now here, now there, the roving Fancy flies,
Till some lov'd object strikes her wand'ring eyes,
Whose silken fetters all the senses bind,
And soft captivity involves the mind.

    Imagination! who can sing thy force?
Or who describe the swiftness of thy course?
Soaring through air to find the bright abode,
Th' empyreal palace of the thund'ring God,
We on thy pinions can surpass the wind,
And leave the rolling universe behind:
From star to star the mental optics rove,
Measure the skies, and range the realms above.
There in one view we grasp the mighty whole,
Or with new worlds amaze th' unbounded soul.

    Though Winter frowns to Fancy's raptur'd eyes
The fields may flourish, and gay scenes arise;
The frozen deeps may break their iron bands,
And bid their waters murmur o'er the sands.
Fair Flora may resume her fragrant reign,
And with her flow'ry riches deck the plain;
Sylvanus may diffuse his honours round,
And all the forest may with leaves be crown'd:
Show'rs may descend, and dews their gems disclose,
And nectar sparkle on the blooming rose.

    Such is thy pow'r, nor are thine orders vain,
O thou the leader of the mental train:
In full perfection all thy works are wrought,
And thine the sceptre o'er the realms of thought.
Before thy throne the subject-passions bow,
Of subject-passions sov'reign ruler thou;
At thy command joy rushes on the heart,
And through the glowing veins the spirits dart.

    Fancy might now her silken pinions try
To rise from earth, and sweep th' expanse on high:
From Tithon's bed now might Aurora rise,
Her cheeks all glowing with celestial dies,
While a pure stream of light o'erflows the skies.
The monarch of the day I might behold,
And all the mountains tipt with radiant gold,
But I reluctant leave the pleasing views,
Which Fancy dresses to delight the Muse;
Winter austere forbids me to aspire,
And northern tempests damp the rising fire;
They chill the tides of Fancy's flowing sea,
Cease then, my song, cease the unequal lay.





If I Had Known
 

  If I had known
  Two years ago how drear this life should be,
  And crowd upon itself allstrangely sad,
  Mayhap another song would burst from out my lips,
  Overflowing with the happiness of future hopes;
  Mayhap another throb than that of joy.
  Have stirred my soul into its inmost depths,
                    If I had known.

  If I had known,
  Two years ago the impotence of love,
  The vainness of a kiss, how barren a caress,
  Mayhap my soul to higher things have soarn,
  Nor clung to earthly loves and tender dreams,
  But ever up aloft into the blue empyrean,
  And there to master all the world of mind,
                    If I had known.





The Idler
 

An idle lingerer on the wayside's road,
  He gathers up his work and yawns away;
  A little longer, ere the tiresome load
  Shall be reduced to ashes or to clay.

  No matter if the world has marched along,
  And scorned his slowness as it quickly passed;
  No matter, if amid the busy throng,
  He greets some face, infantile at the last.

  His mission? Well, there is but one,
  And if it is a mission he knows it, nay,
  To be a happy idler, to lounge and sun,
  And dreaming, pass his long-drawn days away.

  So dreams he on, his happy life to pass
  Content, without ambitions painful sighs,
  Until the sands run down into the glass;
  He smiles--content--unmoved and dies.

  And yet, with all the pity that you feel
  For this poor mothling of that flame, the world;
  Are you the better for your desperate deal,
  When you, like him, into infinitude are hurled?





The Gospel of Barbecue
 

   for Alvester James
Long after it was
necessary, Uncle
Vess ate the leavings
off the hog, doused
them with vinegar sauce.
He ate chewy abominations.
Then came high pressure.
Then came the little pills.
Then came the doctor
who stole Vess's second
sight, the predication
of pig's blood every 
fourth Sunday.
Then came the stillness
of barn earth, no more 
trembling at his step.
Then came the end
of the rib, but before 
his eyes clouded,
Uncle Vess wrote
down the gospel
of barbecue.

Chapter one:
Somebody got to die
with something at some
time or another.

Chapter two:
Don't ever trust 
white folk to cook
your meat until
it's done to the bone.

Chapter three:
December is the best
time for hog killing.
The meat won't
spoil as quick.
Screams and blood
freeze over before
they hit the air.

Chapter four, Verse one:
Great Grandma Mandy
used to say food 
you was whipped
for tasted the best.

Chapter four, Verse two:
Old Master knew to lock
the ham bacon chops
away quick or the slaves
would rob him blind.
He knew a padlock
to the smokehouse
was best to prevent 
stealing, but even the
sorriest of slaves would
risk a beating for a full
belly. So Christmas time
he give his nasty
leftovers to the well
behaved. The head ears
snout tail fatback
chitlins feet ribs balls.
He thought gratitude
made a good seasoning.

Chapter five:
Unclean means dirty
means filthy means
underwear worn too
long in summertime heat.
Perfectly good food
can't be no sin.
Maybe the little
bit of meat on ribs
makes for lean eating.
Maybe the pink flesh
is tasteless until you add
onions garlic black
pepper tomatoes
soured apple cider
but survival ain't never been
no crime against nature
or Maker. See, stay alive
in the meantime, laugh
a little harder. Go on
and gnaw that bone clean.





Memphis Resurrection
 

Who died and made you Elvis?      --Bumper sticker
The big rock by my door
is a plaster prop, after
all. I'm back to hear
screams for what I can't 
do, couldn't do forty
years ago. Awkward
pelvic thrusts fooled
the camera and virgins,
but I have no more fish-
fry tunes left to dress
up on brand new plates.
This time around,
I spend all day singing
cracked Mississippi
homilies. Why 
did I want to live
forever in the first place?
Salvation felt better dead,
floating home free
while my bones, secret
and brown, mingle
with old dirt.





Dreams of My Father
 

Or a man who looks like him.
I only know I call him Daddy
(as all southern women
do until the day we die).
In my dreams he is still alive
and this is not a comfort.
I am my best when tragic.
Grief becomes me.
Daddy is more real in death,
eyes dark, undimmed
by the grave, smile less sincere.
Matter clings to his thick
eyebrows, his mouth spits mud
when he tries to talk. He is candid.
He tells me he liked my sisters better than me.
Most times I search for him in a crowd
of counterfeit Daddies.
I look for pieces of him.
An elbow. Black hair on the back
of a pale neck. If I find him,
I will say, Is that you?
I know you this time.





Roslyn
 

Roslyn has nothing going
nothing to fight for
no work to do
she couldn't name one desire
that is not someone else's
or a man

she cannot claim
where she came from
will not claim who she is
or the way she cries
so no one can see

she has no work to do
cannot finish books
feed herself
or go out alone
she is always late
not to sit alone somewhere
and wait
she wouldn't know what to do

Roslyn doesn't want a thing
but she waits for something anyway
she has no work to do
she holds off interests
passions and opinions
everything but the facts
and these come to her
from dramas and the papers

she agrees with fiction
and what people say
i wouldn't trust her in court
or on my back
a woman without a dream
is a fault in the earth
all steam and liquid fire

Roslyn goes to work
has a job
but no calling
waits for the word
to call herself
no one ever remembers her name
or where they saw her
she waits to be told
she's the only one

her tyranny is silent
small and sexual
her losses are great
she has not called herself
said, "I'm here, now, deal with me

Roslyn wouldn't hurt a fly
but people fear her sleep
her unconscious
the primal whatever
that wants to play
it might have guns out
for the rest of us





skinny-dippin in the gene pool
 

the streets of hell are also paved
with fear of contagion
I have been swimming
in enough barbed-wire waters to know
you're not even safe on the beach
it's not just your "body fluids
it's the grime of your skin
those dirty things you think

they are cleaning up the world again
I can see the inflammation
heartbreak & hunger scurry me down
on the road to Damascus
I want to be blinded like Saul
for the sake of vision
not just cause I can't take it anymore

are we talking burnt out here?
burnt out is a reason for infection
I hope I get the whole disease
I am glad to be a speck / a piece of dirt
the dark side of the earth
they're trying to clean
I want to get in their pores
want them to sweat my filth
the way a wound hurts before the dope
but then come the murderers on the road
are we talking burnt out?
they go in the camps looking for you
cause you are hiding the sores
you could be contagious
after all in the postapocalypse movies
you don't even exist

your survival is not required
for history or hollywood
in the movie Road Warrior
everyone is antisocial on purpose
human ties are burnt out
& human intercourse is fatiguing & dangerous
gratefully no one is traumatized anymore
& unfortunately no one goes to school

in the movie Blade Runner
almost everyone lives 90 stories below
almost no one else
everyone is antisocial by accident
due to overcrowding in L.A. but no one minds
& there are still parties to go to

everyone white is "off-world more or less
everyone 90 stories down is polymorphous colored
more or less
no one has attended school in decades
in both films everyone dresses with panache
which preserves their identities
to audiences who know
there is no grounds for indentity
postworld

personally I prefer the people in Titanic
even though they got their minds blown
when the unbelievable happened
they still believed in life
they were not burnt out
& had grounds for clinging
to lifeboats and a certain
stylish way of dressing

they could not imagine Jim Jensen
intoning without horror
that the body count goes on
that no one needs the news to know
what's going on
Beirut is one of the low levels
Dante went on about
available in ordinary life

see the corpses if you will
believe at the risk
you may see it everywhere
every body spreads infection
unless you burn it out
eyewitness news invites you
to wait for the coverage
because Jim Jensen is there
& history is in the making or
you can come skinny-dip
in my gene pool

the massacres were arbitrary
when my people were hunted down
the deaths still go on
stretching over centuries
of shades of brown
baptist, moslem,
mothers, children, fathers
burnt out of homes but living

I am not that desperate
to be numb & dumb
I'm walking 90 stories down
I know I survive
in some wretched moments
of what men do
but I am not that desperate
I don't give a shit if this is history
in the making
it should stop

I am still alive
I am still happy to be the dirt
that can't be cleaned up
scorch my earth & I will grow
from history up
under the feet of the present
burnt out is for the movies
in which we don't exist





backstage drama
 

for Miami
They all like to hang out.
Thinking is all rather grim to them.
Snake and Minnie,
who love each other dearly,
drink in different bars,
ride home in separate cars.
They like to kiss good night
with unexplored lips.
They go out of town
to see each other open.
This they do for no one else.
Minnie does it all for God.
Snake does it all for fame.
Backstage is where they play their games;
that's why i know their business.

I was gonna talk about a race riot.
They say they've never played that town.
Fleece tells me he's seen an old movie
about a black town attacking a white one.
Sidney Poitier was the young doctor,
accused, abused and enraged.
There were Ossie Davis and Woody Strode,
Ruby Dee and a hundred unknowns.
Also Sapphire's mama as a maid.
"What was Sapphire's mama's name? says Inez.
I was goig to talk about a race riot
but we were stuck on Kingfish's mother-in-law.
Minnie kisses Snake so he'll forget about that
and I say, "They're mad, they're on the bottom
going down, stung by white justice in a white town,
and then there's other colored people,
who don't necessarily think they're colored people,
leaving them the ground.

"That's just like the dreads, the Coptics,
and the Man-ley-ites, one drunk says too loud,
"I and I know, say he.
Snake yells, "Are you crazy? No, it ain't,
and no, we don't.
"That's just like Angola, Terri chimes,
"Sometimes it's not who but what,
sometimes not what but who.

I'm trying to talk to these people
about this race riot,
someone is walking on the bar,
and every one of us belongs even now to Miami,
to people we have never seen.

Pookie and Omar want to know what's goin' on.
They always do,
'cause they're always in the bathroom
when it's goin' on.
They do everything together and not for God,
and not for fame, but for love.
At least that's what their records say.
They are a singing group that's had 13 Pookies.

Omar asks me, "What do you want to say?
Inez interupts, "She don't know what to say,
she just wants to say something,
I understand that.
The 13th Pookie chirps, "This race riot sounds like
all the other race riots.
Fleece says, "And you sound like
12 other Pookies, Pookie.

I am still trying to talk about this race riot.
Minnie looks up and says, "We don't have anywhere
to put any more dead.
Snake puts on his coat to leave alone,
"We never did, we never did.





the attack could not be seen by night
 

this little phase
keeps on the same way
without variety
jazz and compromise
making blue snow grow at the windows
mohair fumes clog my throat like cats
flames pounce without burning
shadows gather in parkas at my back
turn so i can see your face
stand where i can see you man
should someone phone
i will tell whoever it is
i cannot escape this night
even saxophones do not dry
light the brown sweat
terror in white doorways
under multicolored covers
there is no way to sleep
with the phone
falling off the hook
the blaring beep of warnings
do not leave your house
do not stay home
this is the contradiction
of when i live
even fanfares and flourishes
do not announce a truce
with our personal assailants
without variety blue dust
blood traces in floor wax
black fog and nappy lint 
colorless wax spreads broad
tears across all the windows
some permanent weather
happened to this building
some misplaced coal mine
had its disaster here
and i am alive inside





as i fly over this time
 

for Dianne McIntyre
as i fly over this time
rising over only this
so much painted suffering
unseen grimaces and stares
among spruce greens
these few forests left 
all of us trying to be alone
quiet and blind.
       *
i see soldiers in bus stations
with colored names
polaroid shots
their girlfriends chew gum
smile wide
       *
in all this silver of sky
like stars these wheels
car gears lampshades
electrical refuse
zen oiled and greased
the believers now so many
now so tired of the sad songs
the endless yearnings for war
and more and more
       *
dumb cries i sigh
trying to get out of town
i am writing on the wall
it will be painted over
like all the songs
once outside
but as i fly over this time
       *
dianne is dancing
touching the far reaches
leaping and teaching
she strokes and struts the air
none of us stumbles
or fears their lives
steel beams and rail tracks
strike an E-flat, B-flat, A
E-flat, B-flat, A
dianne is dancing
no one can handle the hostages
terror is abandoned
because of light
breaking in leaves
because the center is gone
we are still breathing
and the swing is our bodies





Song
 

Sweet beast, I have gone prowling,
    a proud rejected man
who lived along the edges
    catch as catch can;
in darkness and in hedges
    I sang my sour tone
and all my love was howling
    conspicuously alone.

I curled and slept all day
    or nursed my bloodless wounds
until the squares were silent
    where I could make my tunes
singular and violent.
    Then, sure as hearers came
I crept and flinched away.
    And, girl, you've done the same.

A stray from my own type,
    led along by blindness,
my love was near to spoiled
    and curdled all my kindness.
I find no kin, no child;
    only the weasel's ilk.
Sweet beast, cat of my own stripe,
    come and take my milk.





At the Galleria Shopping Mall
 

Just past the bin of pastel baby socks and underwear,
there are some 49-dollar Chinese-made TVs;

one of them singing news about a far-off war,
one comparing the breast size of an actress from Hollywood

to the breast size of an actress from Bollywood.
And here is my niece Lucinda,

who is nine and a true daughter of Texas,
who has developed the flounce of a pedigreed blonde

and declares that her favorite sport is shopping.
Today is the day she embarks upon her journey,

swinging a credit card like a scythe
through the meadows of golden merchandise.

Today is the day she stops looking at faces,
and starts assessing the labels of purses;

So let it begin. Let her be dipped in the dazzling bounty
and raised and wrung out again and again.

And let us watch.
As the gods in olden stories

turned mortals into laurel trees and crows
                   to teach them some kind of lesson,

so we were turned into Americans
to learn something about loneliness.






Personal
 

Don't take it personal, they said; 
but I did, I took it all quite personal--

the breeze and the river and the color of the fields;
the price of grapefruit and stamps,

the wet hair of women in the rain--
And I cursed what hurt me 

and I praised what gave me joy,
the most simple-minded of possible responses.

The government reminded me of my father,
with its deafness and its laws,

and the weather reminded me of my mom,
with her tropical squalls.

Enjoy it while you can, they said of Happiness
Think first, they said of Talk

Get over it, they said 
at the School of Broken Hearts

but I couldn't and I didn't and I don't
believe in the clean break;

I believe in the compound fracture
served with a sauce of dirty regret,

I believe in saying it all
and taking it all back

and saying it again for good measure
while the air fills up with I'm-Sorries

like wheeling birds
and the trees look seasick in the wind.

Oh life! Can you blame me
for making a scene?

You were that yellow caboose, the moon
disappearing over a ridge of cloud.

I was the dog, chained in some fool's backyard;
barking and barking:

trying to convince everything else 
to take it personal too.






Summer in a Small Town
 

Yes, the young mothers are beautiful,
with all the self-acceptance of exhaustion,
still dazed from their great outpouring,
pushing their strollers along the public river walk.

And the day is also beautiful--the replica 19th-century paddle-wheeler
perpetually moored at the city wharf
                with its glassed-in bar and grill
for the lunch-and-cocktail-seekers
who come for the Mark Twain Happy Hour
which lasts as long as the Mississippi.

This is the kind of town where the rush hour traffic halts
                to let three wild turkeys cross the road,
and when the high school music teacher retires
after thirty years

the movie marquee says, "Thanks Mr. Biddleman!
and the whole town comes to hear
                the tuba solos of old students.

Summer, when the living is easy
and we store up pleasure in our bodies
like fat, like Eskimos,
for the coming season of privation.

All August the Ferris wheel will turn
                           in the little amusement park,
and screaming teenage girls will jump into the river
with their clothes on,
right next to the No Swimming sign.

Trying to cool the heat inside the small towns
                                               of their bodies,
for which they have no words;
obedient to the voice inside which tells them,
"Now. Steal Pleasure.





Captain Haddock vs. the PTA
 

Bewildered Saint of the curse, bulbous 
& profane, I invoke you against this Nest 
Of Lice & Vipers: O volcanic Captain, I implore you, pour
Your scorn upon these Borgias; before these Braggarts 
Unfurl your thick invective, show your bullet head
Whiskey-pickled, weathered & pupilless, sweating 
In a bantam rage, your sad-fish face a fist;
Ostrogothic versus the matrons
Voluble against the Vampire's slander
Because I would never say Vivisectionist to her face
While you old Captain Fatstock, Hopscotch, Havoc 
Denouncer of Bullies, Knitters & Bandits 
Live to make the air around you frantic
To spill your black lake of Cannibal ink.





Perishable, It Said
 

Perishable, it said on the plastic container,
and below, in different ink, 
the date to be used by, the last teaspoon consumed. 

I found myself looking:
now at the back of each hand,
now inside the knees,
now turning over each foot to look at the sole.

Then at the leaves of the young tomato plants, 
then at the arguing jays.

Under the wooden table and lifted stones, looking. 
Coffee cups, olives, cheeses, 
hunger, sorrow, fears--
these too would certainly vanish, without knowing when.

How suddenly then
the strange happiness took me,
like a man with strong hands and strong mouth,
inside that hour with its perishing perfumes and clashings.





The Melon
 

There was a melon fresh from the garden
So ripe the knife slurped 
As it cut it into six slices. 
The children were going back to school.
Their mother, passing out paper plates,
Would not live to see the leaves fall. 

I remember a hornet, too, that flew in
Through the open window 
Mad to taste the sweet fruit
While we ducked and screamed,
Covered our heads and faces,
And sat laughing after it was gone.






Nancy Jane
 

Grandma laughing on her deathbed.
Eternity, the quiet one, listening in.

Like moths around an oil lamp we were.
Like ragdolls tucked away in the attic.

In walked a cat with a mouthful of feathers.
(How about that?)

A dark little country store full of gravedigger's   
     children buying candy. 
(That's how we looked that night.) 

The young men pumping gas spoke of his friends: 
    the clouds.
It was such a sad story, it made everyone laugh.

A bird called out of a tree, but received no answer.

The beauty of that last moment
Like a red sail on the bay at sunset,

Or like a wheel breaking off a car
And roaming the world on its own.





The Piano Speaks
 

After Erik Satie
For an hour I forgot my fat self, 
my neurotic innards, my addiction to alignment.

For an hour I forgot my fear of rain.

For an hour I was a salamander
shimmying through the kelp in search of shore,
and under his fingers the notes slid loose
from my belly in a long jellyrope of eggs
that took root in the mud. And what

would hatch, I did not know--
a lie. A waltz. An apostle of glass.

For an hour I stood on two legs 
and ran. For an hour I panted and galloped.

For an hour I was a maple tree,
and under the summer of his fingers 
the notes seeded and winged away 

in the clutch of small, elegant helicopters.






Unit of Measure
 

All can be measured by the standard of the capybara.
Everyone is lesser than or greater than the capybara.
Everything is taller or shorter than the capybara.
Everything is mistaken for a Brazilian dance craze 
more or less frequently than the capybara.
Everyone eats greater or fewer watermelons 
than the capybara. Everyone eats more or less bark.
Everyone barks more than or less than the capybara, 
who also whistles, clicks, grunts, and emits what is known 
as his alarm squeal. Everyone is more or less alarmed 
than a capybara, who--because his back legs 
are longer than his front legs--feels like
he is going downhill at all times.
Everyone is more or less a master of grasses
than the capybara. Or going by the scientific name,
more or less Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris--
or, going by the Greek translation, more or less
water hog. Everyone is more or less 
of a fish than the capybara, defined as the outermost realm 
of fishdom by the 16th-century Catholic Church.
Everyone is eaten more or less often for Lent than
the capybara. Shredded, spiced, and served over plantains, 
everything tastes more or less like pork 
than the capybara. Before you decide that you are
greater than or lesser than a capybara, consider 
that while the Brazilian capybara breeds only once a year,
the Venezuelan variety mates continuously. 
Consider the last time you mated continuously.
Consider the year of your childhood when you had 
exactly as many teeth as the capybara--
twenty--and all yours fell out, and all his 
kept growing. Consider how his skin stretches
in only one direction. Accept that you are stretchier
than the capybara. Accept that you have foolishly
distributed your eyes, ears, and nostrils 
all over your face. Accept that now you will never be able
to sleep underwater. Accept that the fish 
will never gather to your capybara body offering
their soft, finned love. One of us, they say, one of us,
but they will not say it to you.






Let Me Count the Waves
 

We must not look for poetry in poems.                  --Donald Revell
You must not skirt the issue wearing skirts.
You must not duck the bullet using ducks. 
You must not face the music with your face.
Headbutting, don't use your head. Or your butt.
You must not use a house to build a home,
and never look for poetry in poems.

In fact, inject giraffes into your poems.
Let loose the circus monkeys in their skirts.
Explain the nest of wood is not a home
at all, but a blind for shooting wild ducks.
Grab the shotgun by its metrical butt;
aim at your Muse's quacking, Pringled face.

It's good we're talking like this, face to face.
There should be more headbutting over poems.
Citing an 80s brand has its cost but
honors the teenage me, always in skirts,
showing my sister how to Be the Duck
with a potato-chip beak. Take me home,

Mr. Revell. Or make yourself at home
in my postbellum, Reconstruction face--
my gray eyes, my rebel ears, all my ducks
in the row of a defeated mouth. Poems
were once civil. But war has torn my skirts
off at the first ruffle, baring my butt

or as termed in verse, my luminous butt.
Whitman once made a hospital his home.
Emily built a prison of her skirts.
Tigers roamed the sad veldt of Stevens's face.
That was the old landscape. All the new poems
map the two dimensions of cartoon ducks.

We're young and green. We're braces of mallards,
not barrels of fish. Shoot if you must but
Donald, we're with you. Trying to save poems,
we settle and frame their ramshackle homes.
What is form? Turning art to artifice,
trading pelts for a more durable skirt.

Even urban ducklings deserve a home.
Make way. In the modern: Make way, Buttface.
A poem is coming through, lifting her skirt. 






Another Road Home
 

After Stevens
It was when he said expansively There is 
no such thing as the truth that his thick thumbs 
thickened and his lips, purple as grapes, 
further purpled. When I also spun such 
spinning facilities as these, my own 
vines ripened with what I hoped might prove 

more promising fruit. Yios mou, set the large 
man's handsome books aside and sit with me 
on the airy balcony beside our kind
and loving Father Iakovos. Truth may 
prove to be no such a thing as matter 
for our mulling; still, this evening spread out

before our mountain, above our mountain tea
suggests in its late, cypress-scented air 
a pressing density, a wine-like, whelming
cup, ksinmavro--deep and dark, substantial.
And the road? Meandering, manifestly
inconclusive, and for that reason not
so likely to ferment blithe disregard.






A River
 

God knows the law of life is death,
and you can feel it in your warbler neck,
your river-quick high stick wrist
at the end of day. But the trophies:
a goldfinch tearing up a pink thistle,
a magpie dipping her wing tips
in a white cloud, an ouzel barreling 
hip-high upstream with a warning.
You wish you had a river. To make
a river, it takes some mountains.
Some rain to watershed. You wish
you had a steady meadow and pink thistles
bobbing at the border for your horizons,
pale robins bouncing their good postures
in the spruce shadows. Instead, the law
of life comes for you like three men 
and a car. In your dreams, you win them over
with your dreams: a goldfinch tearing up 
a pink thistle. A magpie so slow 
she knows how to keep death at bay, 
she takes her time with argument 
and hides her royal blue in black. 
Shy as a blue grouse, nevertheless God
doesn't forget his green mountains.
You wish you had a river.






The Llano Estacado
 

How much soil do you plow to soothe a conscience?
If you're a staked plains, dry-land, long view man:
a sky's worth. Some even sow the dry playa
mid-summer with sorghum, the cotton plowed under
after early hail. Thus, not every farmer keeps
an old broken homestead sacred as a graveyard. 
Today, no Sharpshin on a pivot for an omen,
no stoic farmer on a turn-row changing water.

Among a little wind grit, in a grid on a grid, somewhere 
like the crossroads of outer space and Earth, Texas, 
a handful of ragged elms withstand a long sway
of heat and wind. These old guards of a home haunt 
the field but wither even as ghosts must. Honor them
with a walk among homesick bricks, and prophesy good.





An Extraordinary Morning
 

Two young men--you just might call them boys--
waiting for the Woodward streetcar to get 
them downtown. Yes, they're tired, they're also 
dirty, and happy. Happy because they've 
finished a short work week and if they're not rich 
they're as close to rich as they'll ever be 
in this town. Are they truly brothers? 
You could ask the husky one, the one 
in the black jacket he fills to bursting; 
he seems friendly enough, snapping 
his fingers while he shakes his ass and sings 
"Sweet Lorraine, or if you're put off 
by his mocking tone ask the one leaning 
against the locked door of Ruby's Rib Shack, 
the one whose eyelids flutter in time 
with nothing. Tell him it's crucial to know 
if in truth this is brotherly love. He won't 
get angry, he's too tired for anger, 
too relieved to be here, he won't even laugh 
though he'll find you silly. It's Thursday, 
maybe a holy day somewhere else, maybe 
the Sabbath, but these two, neither devout 
nor cynical, have no idea how to worship 
except by doing what they're doing, 
singing a song about a woman they love 
merely for her name, breathing in and out 
the used and soiled air they wouldn't know 
how to live without, and by filling 
the twin bodies they've disguised as filth.





For the Man with the Erection Lasting More than Four Hours
 

He's supposed to call his doctor, but for now he's the May King with his own maypole. 
He's hallelujah. He's glory hole. The world has more women than he can shake a stick 
at. The world is his brickbat, no conscience to prick at, all of us Germans he can ich
liebe dich at. He's Dick and Jane. He's Citizen Kane. He's Bob Dole.
He's Peter the Great. He's a tsar. He's a clown car with an extra car. 
Funicul, Funicul. He's an organ donor. He works pro boner. He's folderol. 
He's fiddlesticks. He's the light left on at Motel 6. He's free-for-alls. 
He's Viagra Falls. He's bangers and mash. He's balderdash. He's a wanker. 
He's got his own anchor. He's whack-a-doodle. King Canoodle. He's a pirate, Long John 
Silver, walking his own plank. He has science to thank. He's in like Flynn. He's Gunga Din, 
holding his breath, cock of the walk through the valley of the shadow of death. He's Icarus, 
hickory dickerous, the mouse run up the clock. He's shock and awe. He's Arkansas. 
He's the package, the deal, the Good Housekeeping Seal. He's Johnson & Johnson. 
He's a god now, the talk of the town. He's got no place to go but down.





Come in from the Rain
 

Stick that bumbershoot
in elephant's-foot

brolly stand behind
the big door. Mind

your manners at High Tea.
Hi, you. High ve-

locity hailstones cream
passersby beyond the panes. I dream

of Jeannie, starring Bar-
bara Eden, of Eden, star-

ring Eve and Adam, of Adam
Cartwright, a.k.a. the let-'em-

have-it-with-all-candor
Trapper John. Pander

to the mass-man mass-taste,
that's my motto. Waste

the day, the life, the villain
with depression, fill-in-

the-wrong-blanks misap-
prehension, dum-dums. Nap

an hour through the Buddy
Ebsen as a perspicacious fuddy-

duddy whodunit. Then produce
the silver teapot, loose

Earl Grey and table water
slabs. Somebody's daughter

carries on the grand tradition
in the grandma manner. Wishin'

you were here don't place you
in the old wing chair. Face you

in the photos, china, art
on parlor walls. It's raining in my heart.






The Truth
 

Every time I use
my language, I tell
the truth. A cat
in a white collar,
like a priest with calico
fur, walks across the dead
grass of the yard, and out
through the white fence. The sun's
strong, but the colors of the lawn
were washed out by the winter, not the light.
February. Stained glass window of the house
next door takes the sun's full brunt.
It must look spectacular
to the neighbor in my head,
a white-haired woman with an air
of dignity and grace, who
through pools of the intensest
colors climbs the flight of stairs.
I've never seen it,
but I know it's there.






Mehr Licht
 

were the last words
of Goethe on his
deathbed as the darkness
closed around him.
But Mayor Licht
was also the chief
executive of Providence,
Rhode Island in the early
Eighties. I'm dreaming
of the best political
commercial of all time--
Weimar in the 1830s,
Goethe gasping "Mehr licht,
mehr licht--and suddenly
Mayor Harry Licht of Providence
appears to pump the paw
of the poet, and save the day.






This is the Latest
 

Lobster in the bathtub. Christmas Eve.
Scrub the tub first. Hand off cleanser.
Rinse well. We don't want Comet
in our lobster. 
He's clicking
against the porcelain. Everyone leery
              of going to the bathroom.

Bubbles had risen when we lowered him in,
now he's limp. 
Stare into the water
that wears a similar gooseflesh.
The lobster is dispatched. 

                      *     *     *


Wrapping an oversized box 
(a coffee maker), 
can't find a swathe of paper big enough. 
Start to cobble bits together 
with tape (ah--chitinous)

and the joints look like repeated segments 
of a carapace. 
A pilot blue glows. Haemocyanin--
a blood based in copper not iron

while the broth of something Provenal 
sings from the pot, a little tomatoey,
a little stigma (not stamen) of crocus sativus
under the Star of
Bethlehem

                      *     *     *

If the universe is--this is the latest--
bouncing between inflation 
and shrinkage, as if on a trillion-year
pendulum, why wouldn't
an infant's sobbing, on the exhale,
have a prosody
as on the inhale have the chemistry 
of tears and seas

or our bouillabaisse,
indeed,
a primal soup contain
--besides babbling
and nonspeech and raspberries--
in the briny speech stream

a scuttling underwriter? 





After the Stroke
 

By the time he'd hit eighty, he was something out of Ovid,
his long beak thin and hooked, 
                                            the fingers of one hand curled and stiff.
Still, he never flew. Only sat in his lawn chair by the highway,
waving a bum wing at passing cars.

I was a timid kid, easily spooked. And it seemed like touchy gods
were everywhere--in the horns
and roar of diesels, in thunder, wind, tree limbs thrashing
the windows at night.

I was ashamed to be afraid of my grandfather.
But the hair on his ears!
                                   The cackle in his throat!
Then on his birthday, my mother coaxed me into the yard.
I carried the cake with the one tiny candle

and sat it on a towel in the shade.
I tried not to tremble,
but it felt like gods were everywhere--in the grimy clouds
smothering the pine tops, the chainsaw 
in Cantrell's woods--everywhere, everywhere,
and from the look of the man
in the lawn chair, he'd pissed one off.





Call as You Will
 

--retracing
trail until

the sun makes
up its mind

to leave 
a wilderness 

behind--you'll
never find 

the dog
who seems

(in this most
vivid of vivid

dreams) alive
and fresh, 

a wish 
made flesh, 

who left 
the leash

and now is
lost--lost

good in the
heart's deep

wood. 





My Soul
 

In the suburbs on a bike path that in
any other age would be a road roughed
halfway through some dark wood's listening heart

two damp young men in suits sucked dry of light
walk stiffly and uncertain round a bend
in each left hand the black box of a book

They see me then spread out to fill the way
as sun blares down and dry May wind slaps
cheap loose plastic cloth against their shins

The thinner taller blond one greets me in
an earnest tone these days not often heard
and when I do not take his offered hand

surprised he pulls it back by jerked degrees
says I'm Elder White this is Elder Cole
We'd like to talk with you about

Then without my willing it this left palm
rises as if to let them read what life
has written there and with eyes as steady

as I always hoped they were I meet the
blue and shaking gaze of this elder who
is younger than my unborn son's first son

and without warmth or cold not harsh or kind
say I do not want to talk about this
These boys awkward in cloth and flesh of men

stammer in relief their soft farewells
and what I would not let them save or name
stands long in silence looking after them





Behind the Prytaneum
 

Tragedy began with a dance in the guise of goats, said Aristotle.
Tragedy began with a sacrifice of goats, said Eratosthenes.
They came to a circle of columns or great white trees.
They drank red resveratrol wine from the bottle. 
A classicist shouts, those are not differing accounts!
One must kill a goat to dress as a satyr.
Way of necessity, way of the wine, a fluid ounce--
in Galilee, where he has turned, said John, the water into rhyme,
a god's son or a vintner dies, not differing accounts
when laser diode udometers measure, millennia later,
the rainfall on fields that yield grapes for wine--
a miracle's a narrative with time
condensed. An ounce for the gorgeous man in the gutter,
the beggar-poet cries, and some crab legs with clarified butter! 






To Do
 

You've planted and weeded and wheelbarrowed, 
           now tapping a pencil, trying to remember
the next thing--what was it?--when a shape 
           drops from the sky, shudders and stops
at a tree--red blotch--whack, whack. 
           A creature big enough on this slow spring day 
to make you mutter, Ho-
           meric, exactly like the popeyed codger
in the John Wayne flick when he sees
           how the bride and groom have broken 
their bed. A big, wild woodpecker. Imagine
           how it would feel to glimpse, like this,
an ivory-billed, that one they say 
           (if that's what they saw) is the last, 
epic of the land, boomerang to be 
           and not. But could it be
this one will make it for real? 
           Make it beyond lit screens, 
this pileated inkling now hopping into brisk beats 
           of loopy flight. And now almost 
in your grasp, the day's next thing,
           when a rattled, rising shriek riddles the air. 
Again. And again you're just beginning:
           a nest of electric light, a boy
waiting for the bus and laughing 
           at the cartoon bird laughing like crazy. 





Poet as Housewife
 

Always a broom leaned against a wall,
meals never on time, if they come at all.

Days without dates through which she moves
empty and stubborn, slightly confused.

Ironing hung dejectedly over a chair,
gestures that come from who-knows-where.

Old letters unanswered, piled together,
papers and pills stuffed deep in a drawer.

Thankful to be part of your heart's great whole
yet devoted to the limits of her own small skull.

O orderly biped, take heed,
leave her alone--let her read.

 






"Was you ever bit by a dead bee?
 

I was, I was--by its posthumous chomp,
by its bad dab of venom, its joy-buzzer buzz.
If you're ever shanked like the chump
that I was, by the posthumous chomp
of an expired wire, you'll bellow out prompt
at the pitiless shiv when she does what she does.
Was you? I was. By its posthumous chomp,
by its bad dab of venom, its joy-buzzer buzz.






O, She Says
 

O, she says (because she loves to say O),
O to this cloud-break that ravels the night, 
O to this moon, its mouthful of sorrow,
O shallow grass and the nettle burr's bite,

O to heart's flare, its wobbly satellite, 
O step after step in stumbling tempo,
O owl in oak, O rout of black bat flight,
(O moaned in Attic and Esperanto)

O covetous tongue, O fat fandango,
O gnat tango in the hot, ochered light,
O wind whirred leaves in subtle inferno,
O flexing of sea, O stars bolted tight,

O ludicrous swoon, O blind hindsight,
O torching of bridges and blood boiled white,
O sparrow and arrow and hell below,
O, she says, because she loves to say O.





Teeth
 

For knowledge, says the Old Sage, add; for wisdom,
subtract. My head in a surgeon's chair, checking 
Lao Tsu's math as these teeth I barely knew 
I had (mumbled of as wisdom) introduced
themselves--rude party guests--right as they had
to go, their pinched goodbye-hello. Like learning
you've been speaking your whole life in prose, 
or my late eighth-grade astonishment that I--
confirmed a Gentile in almost all respects--
had hung so long among the circumcised.

Hard to know what you have, I'll have you know.
Harder to know what you haven't. Knowledge! The nerve!
Hushed up like a gulp behind the tongue,
shrewdly shooting roots down at an age 
my gums were smug from rolling words around, 
when my morals (like my molars) proved
basically interchangeable. Wise
I wasn't, but I wanted it so painfully then.
Now I've had it--you have it, doc. You know 
the drill, or whatever you've got. Take it away . . .






An Auto-da-f
 

I have nothing to recant, I am just 
the decanter. You, the just destroyer, 
have in faith become the role, recalling 
for those gathered the noble fallen
with a prayer to his-grace-above-fire, 
("Turn me, I'm burnt on that side)
St. Lawrence. Well done, I applaud. 
And you: Well executed. 

This is it. Not much else to await
when our fates touch: I've nowhere to be 
but eternity, you've nothing to catch 
but the thatch. Dry on dry,
we keep our wits about us . . .
no one to meet but our match.






A Date
 

The first seated takes the chance he'll be
stood up. She's getting on with the hope she may
get off. One and one make one
in this riddle. Or, more closely, comedy routine:
first, impressions; second, observations. 
Impolite to have thirds. Bachelors and bachelorettes 
beware: more than tonight they can mess up your order.
Who would go for the lobster expects the claws.
No pets allowed, keep your shirt on, places this strict--
like loony bins--require a jacket, sir. Mark sudden pauses, 
gaps in the flap, commas where a sutra might be...
and what shall we make of it, love, perhaps? 
What elevator is this anyway, that even the prospect 
of going down has made you high?

                                                     What're you on?





Learning to swim
 

At forty-eight, to be given water,
which is most of the world, given life
in water, which is most of me, given ease,

which is most of what I lack, here, where walls 
don't part to my hands, is to be born 
as of three weeks ago. Taking nothing 

from you, mother, or you, sky, or you, 
mountain, that you wouldn't take 
if offered by the sea, any sea, or river, 

any river, or the pool, beside which 
a woman sits who would save me 
if I needed saving, in a red suit, as if flame 

is the color of emergency, as I do, 
need saving, from solid things, 
most of all, their dissolve.





Identity
 

When Hans Hofmann became a hedgehog
somewhere in a Germany that has
vanished with its forests and hedgerows
Shakespeare would have been a young actor
starting out in a country that was
only a word to Hans who had learned
from those who had painted animals
only from hearing tales about them
without ever setting eyes on them
or from corpses with the lingering
light mute and deathly still forever
held fast in the fur or the feathers
hanging or lying on a table
and he had learned from others who had
arranged the corpses of animals
as though they were still alive in full
flight or on their way but this hedgehog
was there in the same life as his own
looking around at him with his brush
of camel hair and his stretched parchment
of sheepskin as he turned to each sharp
particular quill and every black
whisker on the long live snout and those
flat clawed feet made only for trundling
and for feeling along the dark undersides
of stones and as Hans took them in he
turned into the Hans that we would see





Blowing the Fluff Away
 

For E.B.
The sprig of unknown bloom you sent last fall
spent the long winter drying on my wall,
mounted on black. But it had turned to fluff
some months ago. Tonight I took it down
because I thought that I had had enough
of staring at it. Brittle, dry and brown,
it seemed to speak too plainly of a waste
of friendship, forced to flower, culled in haste.

So, after months of fearing to walk past
in case the stir should scatter it to bits,
I took it out to scatter it at last
with my own breath, and so to call us quits.
--Fooled! for the fluff was nothing but a sheath,
with tiny, perfect flowers underneath.





Who Lived Among Them
 

Two rooms, the Aegean, 2008, 
there lived a rhapsode and his wife. 
When they ate, they ate straight 
from the vine. Her curves, sibilance,
Serbo-Croatian chants. His chants, 
curves of clocks, burnished bells. 
When they ate, they boiled wings and gills.

Nights, slate olives, he couldn't see.
Your words are what's missing of me. 
Nights, slate olives, the girl who watched
goats leapt the fence
of fret wire to watch 
the rhapsode's wife writhe lily-wide. 
When they ate, they ate straight from the fire.





When Big Joan Sets Up
 

Imagine having enough left 
to break a bottle over it. 
Listen how pretty, listen 

for glass in nothing nearby 
shattering, just morning birds 
that do not wake whoever

is not sleeping. Come here
Little Birdie, come here. 
No matter how great the gains 

so many complaints hang--
The grass full of worms, 
and still all that squawking, 

like a couple talking and talking 
about never talking. The chatter
of hunger, that gaudy red--





Note Held
 

"Nothing but sunlight and gleaming, 
linoleum flecked with flame,
a thick coat of wax that flashed
down a corridor and led to a room,
a place where I curled up a few 
innocuous inches off the floor. 
Straps--word out of strophe,
the restraints of line and stanza--
straps hung in loops on closet hooks. 
On the nightstand a basket with 
peanut butter crackers, a vivid 
and unnatural orange, a crinkly 
wrap. A knee-high fridge stocked 
with icy juices, foil boxes, straws 
glued on. A female voice next door 
claimed she was still a human being, 
though I could not hear the reasons. 
When it was my turn, I answered 
right away, saying I knew where 
I was and why. No, I would not 
harm myself, surprised to be asked 
as I had never had the thought. 
Yes I knew where I was going next. 
Out the window and through shadow 
and streetlight, I saw how this building 
connected to the next. I was to follow 
a stripe painted on the wall. Someone 
would walk with me as well. I felt fine 
I said, and it was sort of true. Actually 
I felt nailed by one wrist to a desire 
to flee and by the other to a sincere 
longing for sleep. I was not in pain. 
Thank you. I felt like the very last note 
in a concert, the one that hovers as if 
it wants to linger, but is already over.





Cloud No Bigger than a Mans Hand
 

It approaches from the sea, too small
For thunder and lightning
But ominous as a closed fist
And what it will bring

Nearing us, growing larger,
Is completely unknown.
Beware the leaves blowing, beware
The spot on the sun.

All is turned toward it. It rides
The brow of the mind.
Soon, it will shadow one cliff
And a small coastal shrine.

Beware the leaves blowing, beware
The spot on the sun.
Do your work well. Behold
The work yet to be done.






Houston in the Early Eighties
 

before iced coffee came to town, a sump from which I've fished
many a memory of regret and loneliness and whose misery 
I now understand came less from my pocked nature than from 
the chokehold of blue laws, and from my broken-willed Eeyore 
of a used car which liked to stop stubbornly in Sealy, halfway to 
Hill Country, and always one day after the insurance ran out, 
and from the paucity of public space so that we drove (locally) 
from shopping strip to balding park, once to a leech-infested pond; 
and owing also to the blinding afternoons that made invisible,
to the unpracticed eye, micro-lands of existing urban hip, or just a bench 
on which to read the paper, the scarce sense from city planners 
that those residents without garden-crusted homes held their own set
of municipal needs which might take the form of some kind of . . .
beauty; together with the impossibility of finding deep 
shade or hearing wind flash through trees, the abundance of short 
rain storms or hurricanes, both of which, equally, caused water to boil 
out of the sewers and flood the car (which wouldn't, then, even be 
starting out to break down in Sealy without borrowing again 
to fix it); and the living rooms' glass sliders opening without apology 
onto the apartments' walkway and courtyard, motel-style, 
furthering the shallow sense of experience; and all this witnessed
by two small universities whose meek students made no protest 
that their third-largest city in the United States--a town sporting more 
soft-food cafeterias than all the chipped-beef eaters in the world 
could possibly attend at once--offered but two art cinemas 
and nearly nowhere to wander or peruse, nowhere to make peace 
with the simple fact of your twenties; and on such a day as this, 
the one I walked through this morning in late June, on such a day 
we would have gathered those friends we could draw from their corners, 
their condos, their garage apartments humming to beat the cicadas, 
and we would meet in one driveway with a particular lock-and-key 
of desperation-and-relief I have been lucky enough not to feel since,
a collective village slamming the doors on our town, plugging in 
a tape as we took off for Galveston because if it was going to be endlessly 
flat it might as well be on a beach regardless of the soupy knee-high water 
or the thwapping mullets jumping out of it, and we might as well be
together on a blanket in the middle of the desert drinking something 
cool enough to slake one of all our many raging, hissing thirsts.





The Poem of the Little House at the Corner  of Misapprehension and Marvel
 

During Napoleon iii's coup d'etat one of  his officers, Count de Saint-Arnaud, on being informed that a mob was approaching the Imperial Guard, coughed and exclaimed, with his hand across his throat, "Ma sacree toux! (my damned cough). But his lieutenant, understanding him to say "Massacrez tous! (massacre them all), gave the order to fire, killing thousands--needlessly.                    --Guy Murchie
"He was mortared to death.
 A pity, how we misspeak and mishear. 

--Or "martyred? Not that/coin-flip/either 
makes a difference to the increasingly cooler 

downtick of a corpse's cells. "We heard the crazy mating joy 
of the loon across the water. Yes, but what 

do we know, amateurs that we are? Loon, shmoon. 
It might have been dying, announcing 

its pain in those trilling pennants. It might 
have been the girl who was lost in these woods last week 

and never found by the volunteer searchers, 
it might have been her ghost 

with an admonishment. The truth is, 
even among ourselves we often can't distinguish pain 

from pleasure, not in our beds, our hearts, the tone 
of a poem on the final exam (a coin-toss). A pity, because 

we know the urgency of some utterance; 
and the intended goodwill of our listening; and 

the marvelous basic mechanics of speech, 
of lung: 300 million alveoli that, "if spread out flat, 

as my eighth-grade science teacher preened, "would come to 
750 square feet, the entire floor space of an average house, 

and she added that tired magic about how atoms 
of Julius Caesar and Napoleon and Beethoven did 

their fleet anachronistic dance in every inhalation 
of ours, although at thirteen I preferred to think 

that the atoms of Cleopatra's body--my Cleopatra, 
inflating her see-through empresswear 

with husky breaths--commingled with my blood, and also 
realized in my own dim way it wasn't only Einstein, 

Shakespeare, Madame Curie populating my oxygen, 
but also the smelly and scabby old man 

from across the street who'd died last year 
when the late-shift ward nurse heard (as she said in her testimony) 

"med injection instead of (as the outgoing 
ward nurse told her) "bed inspection--altogether 

an unfortunate example of my theme . . . although 
exempla abound, misapprehension 

also dancing inside us at the atomic level. 
Someone thought the gate was locked, she always locked 

the gate in the late afternoon when the haze set down 
and the sun for a moment seemed to carmelize the lake top, 

so the gate was locked; except that it wasn't, 
and seven days into it nobody's found the girl 

or a scraggle of hair or a single ribbon. I tell you 
we're amateurs, we're sometimes bungling amateurs,

of the minutiae of our own lives. When I heard the sounds 
that gurgled from my chest as my wife was leaving 

into the dense, conspiratorial Austin, Texas night,
I couldn't have said if it was defeat 

or relief. She couldn't have said which one
she'd have been happiest to cause. We only knew

that I'd been wrong at times, and she'd been wrong at times, 
and that our total errors, if spread out flat, 

become the house we live in. They're another system 
inside us, along with the cardiac and the pulmonary,

they're moving us toward the horizon line. And when 
enough errors accumulate there, that's what 

we call the future. Even now, as you read this, 
someone in that unknowable distance 

is breathing you in.

PICTURES OF BUGS BUNNY DRESSED LIKE A THUG

What drove me to draw this picture
Of Bugs Bunny dressed like a thug?

Plural. Pictures. Not once did I sketch
The buff tattooed torso of Thug Bugs

But many times, over several days.
He looks mean, doesn't he? When O when

Will this election be over
So I can blow off life again

Without inadvertently producing objects
Of great and mysterious-to-me beauty.


POEM FOR A SIXTH WEDDING

You know a lot better than I do
What you're doing





I Google Myself
 

I Google myself
I want you to love me
When I feel down
I want you to Google me
I search myself
I want you to find me
I Google myself
I want you to remind me



I don't Google anybody else
When I think about you 
I Google myself
Ooh
I don't Google anybody else
At home alone in the middle of the night
I Google myself



I Google myself
And see you before me
Any fool could see
Just how much I Google myself
Get down on your knees &
Friend me and Poke me



I don't Google anybody else
When I think about you
I Google myself
Ooh I don't Google anybody else
At home alone in the middle of the night
I Google myself
and I like what I see
Oh oh oh oh I can't stop Googling myself
1,690,000 results for Googling myself
When I haven't Googled myself for a while
You're the sun who makes me shine
I'm one of millions who constantly Google themselves
I want to make you mine
I don't Google anybody else
And when I think about you I Google myself
Ooh, ooh, oo, oo ahh 





The Swiss Just Do Whatever
 

The Swiss just do whatever
like masturbating their doink-doinks
deep in rural France
in the shadow of Mont Blanc.

Heavy, dependable
and prepared for whatever
the Swiss vago-simulacrum recognizes
as larder

King Hussein and President Fabio,
always just about to touch each other
on their devolved sparkle-offs
and Neil Patrick Harris appreciation pages.

Everyone knows when these bizzarre Swiss cometh
they cometh with fluffy Beatles-like
six packs of shit-covered reindeer
knock-knocking like a bummer.

Glitter is the Swiss Army knife
of the most bedazzlingly ridiculous
emotions: the part just before
the paranoid cheese-maker says,

"Whatever you do in Palm Springs,
don't yodel--a most unusual Swiss Miss
mixture of very early skunk and the robotic
sadness of women's mold

heavy, greasy, dense and low, like
lethargic sea-green gardens
with a buzz overpowering, like
modern outdoor inbreeding.

You know you're Swiss when,
when foreign visitors ask to see your
chocolate factory, you answer,
"Why don't you and Hannibal Lecter

 just kick out the jams?
'Cause you know you got the chamber,
the chair,
and Fear Factor.





Poems About Trees
 

I have written a couple of poems about trees
poems about trees and snakes and lakes and birds
poems about nature and life in New England
I write crappy poems and eat babies
if you like poems about trees you're in for a treat

when I get nervous I get hyper and bump into people
I read to them what MapQuest gave me
round during then in the mom seeker panties
to help me narrow down the slut thing word jobs
rawr I'm too stupid to be able to make my point clear

if you for critique you eventually works at what a
chromosome disorder speech theory itch be responsible
congratulations, really nice birth control
is the most important challenge to vintage porn food stamps
and then I thought only God etc. (i.e. chemicals about progesterone)

the woods are full of police
90% Khalil Gibran, 10% carved wooden men
that can see souls at night
but I, warlike, considering gray cream for attire
enjoying impossible "nudes on ice, more death

as though your hands were hollow and sequently
the big soprano going back to her church
because her crazy French mom does and no one knows why
brainwashed creationists go ever yodeling to attract
the jolly echo of a forest of orange sauce
"you anus look like a chicken pie
I hate you, dig me up

people write poems about trees and the words
are shaped like a tree

kids are stupid

Unicorn Believers Dont Declare Fatwas
 

Oddly enough, there is a
"Unicorn Pleasure Ring in existence.
Research reveals that Hitler lifted
the infamous swastika from a unicorn
emerging from a colorful rainbow.

Nazi to unicorn: "You're not coming
out with me dressed in that ridiculous
outfit. You can finally tell your daughter
that unicorns are real. One ripped the head off
a waxwork of Adolf Hitler, police said.

April 22 is a nice day. I really like it.
I mean it's not as fantastic as that Hitler
unicorn ass but it's pretty special to me.
CREAMING bald eagle there is a tiny Abe
Lincoln boxing a tiny Hitler. MAGIC UNICORNS

"You're really a unicorn? "Yes. Now
kiss my feet. Hitler as a great man.
Hitler . . . mm yeah, Hitler, Hitler, Hitler,
Hitler, Hitler, Hitler . . . German food is so bad,
even Hitler was a vegetarian, just like a unicorn.

I was sort of doodling Hitler at my friend's
house and we couldn't stop watching
unicorn hardcore soft porn abortion e-cards
containing scenes in which the baby angora unicorn
and Hitler stay warm on a cold night.

This blog is dedicated to the individual
mystery of Hitler's moustache and my book of poems
to becoming a unicorn. That unicorn is worse than Hitler.
The unicorn has always been a mythological animal:
Flossy Unicorn Puppet Show Cats That Look Like Hitler Pez Dispensers

Unicorn believers don't declare fatwas.
So worry about something more important
like getting hit in a collision between
a comet being ridden by Elvis, and Hitler
riding a Unicorn. It's a psychedelic unicorn light show

and you know that's groovy baby!





Why do I hate Flarf so much?
 

She came from the mountains, killing zombies at will. Some people cried "but that was cool! and I could only whisper "we should NOT be killing zombies! What have you gotten yourself to do? Did it ever occur to you that you may in fact hate yourself? I know I do . . . I'm not nearly high enough yet--and you're not helping. My group got invited to join the Flarfist Collective, set up some hibachis and do what we do best, if you know what I mean. I wouldn't have so much of a problem with this writing if it were a library and I checked out the entire world as if it were a single book. Strike "helpful off your list. The 4th quarter gets pretty intense and the announcers are usually trying to figure out who is going to become overwhelmed by their own arrogant nightmares. It would upset the stomach of the balance of nature. I always go red over the stupidest things and I have no clue why. Whether it's speaking in front of the class or someone asking me why I think I have the right to say anything. Why do I need an enemy to feel okay about what I'm doing? Observe yourself as you browse with sophistication through the topic of Authorship & Credibility. Why do I hate the surface of the world so much that I want to poison it? Why do I hate this so much? Well . . . you Hate Your Fucking Dad! Why is the screen so damn small? And why does the car turn so sharply? And why is the only sound I hear the sound of a raft of marmosets? BECAUSE I'm fucking ANXIOUS AS HELL about EVERYTHING. AAAAAAAAARGH. It's even worse: "I'll tell you later. The medium is literally made of thousands of beautiful, living, breathing wolves. Why do I hate the moon so much? Unpublish your ideas in reverse. People hate any new way of writing. My girlfriend really hates it. There is not so much daytime left. Life is like spring snow tossing off mercurial Creeley-like escapes from life-threatening health problems. In summer we love winter in winter we love summer--all poetry is written in social mercurochrome. Since I hate the abridgement of life, a function of needing to please unpleaseable parents is more what this is about. Hate and love--if those are the options I just want to love and hate lobsters. The oddity is not so much that Blake held these eccentric views for most of his life, but that in modern civilization they not only extend the hand, so that it could not complain about complaining about something it hadn't even bothered to read, and instead formed a halfway decent indie rock band. I'm actually starting to get much more interested in white people than I used to be. Why do I hate Flarf so much? Because it is against everything good this country once espoused. Why do I hate Flarf so much? Because of the awful conflict it places the law-abiding or police-fearing poets under.





The Not Tale (Funeral)
 

From "Shorter Chaucer Tales" (2006)
The great labour of appearance
Served the making of the pyre. 
But how 
Nor how
How also
How they
Shal nat be toold
Shall not be told.
Nor how the gods
Nor how the beestes and the birds 
Nor how the ground agast
Nor how the fire 
First with straw
And then with drye 
And then with grene 
And then with gold
And then
Now how a site is laid like this.
Nor what
Nor how
Nor how
Nor what she spak nor what was her desir
Nor what jewels
When the fire
Nor how some threw their 
And some their 
And their 
And cups full of wine and milk 
And blood
Into the fyr
Into the fire.
Nor how three times 
And three times with
And three times how.
And how that
Nor how
Nor how
Nor how
Nor who
I cannot tell 
Nor can I say
But shortly to the point I turn
And make of my tale an ende.

Islam

          e2 the new york times, tuesday, september 11, 2001
          arts abroad
          Continued From First Arts Page
          On Islam, Mr. Houellebecq went still further, deriding his estranged mother for converting to Islam and proclaiming that, while all monotheistic religions were "cretinous, "the most stupid religion is Islam. And he added: "When you read the Koran, you give up. At least the Bible is
          Sexual tourism
          and inflammatory
          remarks about
          Palestinians.
          very beautiful because Jews have an extraordinary literary talent. And later, noting that "Islam is a dangerous religion, he said it was condemned to disappear, not only because God does not exist but also because it was being undermined by capitalism.

A Man
 

(For My Father)
I listened to them talking, talking,
That tableful of keen and clever folk,
Sputtering . . . followed by a pale and balking
Sort of flash whenever some one spoke;
Like musty fireworks or a pointless joke,
Followed by a pointless, musty laughter. Then
Without a pause, the sputtering once again . . .
The air was thick with epigrams and smoke;
And underneath it all
It seemed that furtive things began to crawl,
Hissing and striking in the dark,
Aiming at no particular mark,
And careless whom they hurt.
The petty jealousies, the smiling hates
Shot forth their venom as they passed the plates,
And hissed and struck again, aroused, alert;
Using their feeble smartness as a screen
To shield their poisonous stabbing, to divert
From what was cowardly and black and mean.

Then I thought of you,
Your gentle soul, 
Your large and quiet kindness;
Ready to caution and console,
And, with an almost blindness
To what was mean and low.
Baseness you never knew;
You could not think that falsehood was untrue,
Nor that deceit would ever dare betray you.
You even trusted treachery; and so,
Guileless, what guile or evil could dismay you?
You were for counsels rather than commands.
Your sweetness was your strength, your strength a sweetness
That drew all men, and made reluctant hands
Rest long upon your shoulder.
Firm, but never proud,
You walked your sixty years as through a crowd
Of friends who loved to feel your warmth, and who
Knowing that warmth, knew you.
Even the casual beholder
Could see your fresh and generous completeness,
Like dawn in a deep forest, growing and shining through.
Such faith has soothed and armed you. It has smiled
Frankly and unashamed at Death; and, like a child,
Swayed half by joy and half by reticence,
Walking beside its nurse, you walk with Life;
Protected by your smile and an immense
Security and simple confidence.

Hearing the talkers talk, I thought of you . . .
And it was like a great wind blowing
Over confused and poisonous places.
It was like sterile spaces
Crowded with birds and grasses, soaked clear through
With sunlight, quiet and vast and clean.
And it was forests growing,
And it was black things turning green.
And it was laughter on a thousand faces . . .
It was, like victory rising from defeat,
The world made well again and strong--and sweet.





Lawyer and Child
 

How large was Alexander, father,
       That parties designate
The historic gentleman as rather
       Inordinately great?

Why, son, to speak with conscientious
       Regard for history,
Waiving all claims, of course, to heights pretentious,--
       About the size of me.





Getting Information Out of Pa
 

My pa he didn't go to town
      Last evening after tea,
But got a book and settled down
      As comfy as could be.
I'll tell you I was offul glad
      To have my pa about
To answer all the things I had
      Been tryin' to find out.

And so I asked him why the world
      Is round instead of square,
And why the piggies' tails are curled,
      And why don't fish breathe air?
And why the moon don't hit a star,
      And why the dark is black,
And just how many birds there are,
      And will the wind come back?

And why does water stay in wells,
      And why do June bugs hum,
And what's the roar I hear in shells,
      And when will Christmas come?
And why the grass is always green,
      Instead of sometimes blue,
And why a bean will grow a bean
      And not an apple, too?

And why a horse can't learn to moo,
      And why a cow can't neigh?
And do the fairies live on dew,
      And what makes hair grow gray--
And then my pa got up an' gee!
      The offul words he said,
I hadn't done a things, but he
      Jest sent me off to bed.





The Little Boy Lost
 

Father, father, where are you going
       O do not walk so fast.
Speak father, speak to your little boy
       Or else I shall be lost,

The night was dark no father was there
       The child was wet with dew.
The mire was deep, & the child did weep
       And away the vapour flew.





Boy and Father
 

The boy Alexander understands his father to be a famous lawyer.
The leather law books of Alexander's father fill a room like hay in a barn.
Alexander has asked his father to let him build a house like bricklayers build, a house with walls and roofs made of big leather law books. 

   The rain beats on the windows
   And the raindrops run down the window glass
   And the raindrops slide off the green blinds down the siding.

The boy Alexander dreams of Napoleon in John C. Abbott's history, Napoleon the grand and lonely man wronged, Napoleon in his life wronged and in his memory wronged.
The boy Alexander dreams of the cat Alice saw, the cat fading off into the dark and leaving the teeth of its Cheshire smile lighting the gloom.

Buffaloes, blizzards, way down in Texas, in the panhandle of Texas snuggling close to New Mexico,
These creep into Alexander's dreaming by the window when his father talks with strange men about land down in Deaf Smith County.
Alexander's father tells the strange men: Five years ago we ran a Ford out on the prairie and chased antelopes.

Only once or twice in a long while has Alexander heard his father say my first wife' so-and-so and such-and-such.
A few times softly the father has told Alexander, Your mother . . . was a beautiful woman . . . but we won't talk about her.'
Always Alexander listens with a keen listen when he hears his father mention my first wife' or Alexander's mother.'

Alexander's father smokes a cigar and the Episcopal rector smokes a cigar, and the words come often: mystery of life, mystery of life.
These two come into Alexander's head blurry and grey while the rain beats on the windows and the raindrops run down the window glass and the raindrops slide off the green blinds and down the siding.
These and: There is a God, there must be a God, how can there be rain or sun unless there is a God?

So from the wrongs of Napoleon and the Cheshire cat smile on to the buffaloes and blizzards of Texas and on to his mother and to God, so the blurry grey rain dreams of Alexander have gone on five minutes, maybe ten, keeping slow easy time to the raindrops on the window glass and the raindrops sliding off the green blinds and down the siding.





When I Was One-and-Twenty
 

When I was one-and-twenty
       I heard a wise man say,
"Give crowns and pounds and guineas
       But not your heart away;
Give pearls away and rubies
       But keep your fancy free.
But I was one-and-twenty,
       No use to talk to me.

When I was one-and-twenty
       I heard him say again,
"The heart out of the bosom
       Was never given in vain;
'Tis paid with sighs a plenty
       And sold for endless rue.
And I am two-and-twenty,
       And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.

Ejido: A landholding community owned collectively by its members. In 1992, 
the Mexican congress (largely at the behest of Wall Street) passed legislation 
aimed at watering-down Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution (guaranteeing 
the fundamental economic and cultural rights of the ejidos), opening the way 
for the privatization and commercialization of the lands, thus rendering the 
peasants' political gains (stemming from the Mexican Revolution of 1910-
1917) effectively moot.





The Cane-Bottomd Chair
 

In tattered old slippers that toast at the bars,
And a ragged old jacket perfumed with cigars,
Away from the world and its toils and its cares,
I've a snug little kingdom up four pair of stairs.

To mount to this realm is a toil, to be sure,
But the fire there is bright and the air rather pure;
And the view I behold on a sunshiny day
Is grand through the chimney-pots over the way.

This snug little chamber is cramm'd in all nooks
With worthless old nicknacks and silly old books,
And foolish old odds and foolish old ends,
Crack'd bargains from brokers, cheap keepsakes from friends.

Old armour, prints, pictures, pipes, china (all crack'd),
Old rickety tables, and chairs broken-backed;
A twopenny treasury, wondrous to see;
What matter? 'tis pleasant to you, friend, and me.

No better divan need the Sultan require, 
Than the creaking old sofa that basks by the fire;
And 'tis wonderful, surely, what music you get
From the rickety, ramshackle, wheezy spinet.

That praying-rug came from a Turcoman's camp;
By Tiber once twinkled that brazen old lamp;
A Mameluke fierce yonder dagger has drawn:
'Tis a murderous knife to toast muffins upon.

Long, long through the hours, and the night, and the chimes,
Here we talk of old books, and old friends, and old times;
As we sit in a fog made of rich Latakie
This chamber is pleasant to you, friend, and me.

But of all the cheap treasures that garnish my nest,
There's one that I love and I cherish the best:
For the finest of couches that's padded with hair
I never would change thee, my cane-bottom'd chair.

'Tis a bandy-legg'd, high-shoulder'd, worm-eaten seat,
With a creaking old back, and twisted old feet;
But since the fair morning when Fanny sat there,
I bless thee and love thee, old cane-bottom'd chair.

If chairs have but feeling, in holding such charms,
A thrill must have pass'd through your wither'd old arms!
I look'd, and I long'd, and I wish'd in despair;
I wish'd myself turn'd to a cane-bottom'd chair.

It was but a moment she sate in this place,
She'd a scarf on her neck, and a smile on her face!
A smile on her face, and a rose in her hair,
And she sate there, and bloom'd in my cane-bottom'd chair.

And so I have valued my chair ever since,
Like the shrine of a saint, or the throne of a prince;
Saint Fanny, my patroness sweet I declare,
The queen of my heart and my cane-bottom'd chair.

When the candles burn low, and the company's gone,
In the silence of night as I sit here alone--
I sit here alone, but we yet are a pair--
My Fanny I see in my cane-bottom'd chair.

She comes from the past and revists my room;
She looks as she then did, all beauty and bloom;
So smiling and tender, so fresh and so fair,
And yonder she sits in my cane-bottom'd chair.





The Great Order of the Universe
 







Sorrow Home
 

My roots are deep in southern life; deeper than John Brown or Nat Turner or Robert Lee. I was sired and weaned in a tropic world. The palm tree and banana leaf, mango and coconut, breadfruit and rubber trees know me.

Warm skies and gulf blue streams are in my blood. I belong with the smell of fresh pine, with the trail of coon, and the spring growth of wild onion.

I am no hothouse bulb to be reared in steam-heated flats with the music of El and subway in my ears, walled in by steel and wood and brick far from the sky.

I want the cotton fields, tabacco and the cane. I want to walk along with sacks of seed to drop in fallow ground. Restless music is in my heart and I am eager to be gone.

O Southland, sorrow home, melody beating in my bone and blood! How long will the Klan of hate, the hounds and the chain gangs keep me from my own?





Childhood
 

When I was a child I knew red miners
dressed raggedly and wearing carbide lamps.
I saw them come down red hills to their camps
dyed with red dust from old Ishkooda mines.
Night after night I met them on the roads,
or on the streets in town I caught their glance;
the swing of dinner buckets in their hands,
and grumbling undermining all their words.

I also lived in low cotton country
where moonlight hovered over ripe haystacks,
or stumps of trees, and croppers' rotting shacks
with famine, terror, flood, and plague near by;
where sentiment and hatred still held sway
and only bitter land was washed away.





For Malcolm X
 

All you violated ones with gentle hearts;
You violent dreamers whose cries shout heartbreak;
Whose voices echo clamors of our cool capers,
And whose black faces have hollowed pits for eyes.
All you gambling sons and hooked children and bowery bums
Hating white devils and black bourgeoisie,
Thumbing your noses at your burning red suns,
Gather round this coffin and mourn your dying swan.

Snow-white moslem head-dress around a dead black face!
Beautiful were your sand-papering words against our skins!
Our blood and water pour from your flowing wounds.
You have cut open our breasts and dug scalpels in our brains.
When and Where will another come to take your holy place?
Old man mumbling in his dotage, crying child, unborn?





Love Song for Alex, 1979
 

My monkey-wrench man is my sweet patootie;
the lover of my life, my youth and age.
My heart belongs to him and to him only;
the children of my flesh are his and bear his rage
Now grown to years advancing through the dozens
the honeyed kiss, the lips of wine and fire
fade blissfully into the distant years of yonder
but all my days of Happiness and wonder
are cradled in his arms and eyes entire.
They carry us under the waters of the world
out past the starposts of a distant planet
And creeping through the seaweed of the ocean
they tangle us with ropes and yarn of memories
where we have been together, you and I.





Rattlesnakes Hammered on the Wall
 

Seven of them pinned in blood by
long, shiny tails, three of them still

alive and writhing against the wood,
their heaviness whipping the wall

as they try to break free,
rattles beating in unison,

hisses slowly dying in silence,
the other four hanging stiff

like ropes to another life,
patterns of torn skin dripping

with power and loss, the wonder
of who might have done this

turning in shock as all seven
suddenly come alive when

I get closer, pink mouths
trembling with white fangs,

lunging at me then falling back,
entangled in one another to form

twisted letters that spell a bloody
word I can't understand.





The Magnets
 

                           on turning forty
They draw me closer like the hands
of one grandmother I kissed upon
visiting her in the barrio.
The magnets make me look at my waist,
wondering why the ache is in the street,
houses giving off stinking air,
a magnetic field collecting old newspapers,
broken-down cars, alleys where 
the drummer cowers before he beats
on his bag of beer cans.

I visit the irrigation canal that
churns green and flows beyond the streets,
wait for the alligator to swim by,
the one released from the plaza long ago.
I feel the pull toward the mongrel dog,
the clicking of the magnets in the church,
an attraction for open doorways.

                                   *

I remove the magnet from my neck,
a medal of a denied saint.
I will never witness the migration of bats again,
stand at the entrance of the caverns
as bats shoot out of the opening,
the evening bristling with their intelligence.

The sky bruises against the horizon
of yucca plants erect as magnets
surrrounding the cavern,
miles of yucca encircling the poles
to protect them from the wind
that pulls me into the hole.

                                   *

He tells me to believe what I have seen,
insists magnetic force comes from the blade,
the woman wanting us to keep something for her.
He says magnets are missing metals
from an underground wound,
a husband's wrist broken by a slammed car hood,
loyal dance of an old couple watching the street.

He says tortillas and menudo attract flies.
He learned red chili kills all life,
insists magnets let him sleep fulfilled,
delicious food he fixes
long after his wife has died.

He cries that the magnets get stronger
when he peels the pods to find no difference
in the seeds of hunger and the seeds of love.

                                   *

I climb the rocks because the minerals are there,
ascend to where I buried the seashell,
rusted can, and pencil twenty-eight years ago.
I reach the rocks because I am allowed one mountain,
climbing to readjust the magnets.
Then, I stand and look down.

I clear my chest of a fist encountered up here,
set my foot on the humming slab.
I move to survive when I touch my heart.
I climb higher before deciding to bend and dig.





Railroad Face
 

I sit with my railroad face and ask God to forgive me
for being a straight line toward the dead
who were buried with their poor clothes
in the Arizona desert of iron borders.

This way of waving to the embers of the past,
not apologzing for carrying torn rosaries inside
my pockets where beads of worry became fossilized
insects whose dry husks I kept since a child.

Faces adopted me from boys who hated their parents.
I was told not to repeat this,
reminded by the priest who unmasked himself.
I was told there was a great horror down
the hallway of the smelly Catholic school.
Once, my friend Joey jumped off the second floor window
and flattened his brains over the asphalt yard.

I see a hibiscus blossom.
It is a bright yellow flower that lasts one day.
Its shape brings tears, saves me from the hummingbird
that dots the air with patterns resembling an alphabet
too familiar to smell like a railroad worker.

I love heaven when I admit the spikes
and the railroad ties came from
the labor of fate and not the labor of love.
The tracks are my cross.

The tiny car is full of sweating men.
They look into the eye of the sun,
hold their hammers over their blackened heads.
If staring grows in the common search,
a perfume dots the heart with greed.
Silence between the lightning of pounding stakes.

Once, I rode the train home
to see if the smoke from the speeding engine
was going to enter my lungs.
I never wore the old, yellow hat of the crew,
but returned the shovel and the bag of railroad spikes,
thought I saw my grandfather, the foreman, running
across the desert in overalls, changing his skin
from brown to the black of the scorched engine.

I live with my railroad face, its smoothness hammered
by sweating crews that knew the line of hot iron
was going to end in the west someday.
I live with my railroad face and don't know why
the tracks disappear on the horizon.
I cross my railroad face and comb my hair.





Adult
 

Everything was the apple and the glass of tea.
The mountain, the mold, the apron on the grandmother--
the neck of a brown baby holding its tiny head
to get rid of the black bees.
This is the end of a bad century,
the opening of a door that was never built into the chest.

A volume of loud wires coming out of the ground.
My grandfather rising from fifty-four years of death to see me.
The instrument carved out of bone.
A lock of hair from a famous seventeenth-century poet.
The disintegrating bible wishing it was another book.
A hanging arm sweeping the water out of the way.
My memory of flying through the tunnel that came out of nowhere.

A dog with wings and a cat with magic.
The sentiment and the sweat.
The blue chest of the working man and 
the bare ankle of a young girl who drank beer.
The shadow of a young boy named Carlos and
the bare shoulders of a young girl who whispered.

The hunger of an older boy named Jos.
The hard work of a brother named Ramn with
a closeness and a disagreement among them.
A torn pair of work pants and
a stiff and muddy pair of gloves.
A pocket with two dollars crumbled inside.
A bare foot rubbing the bare back of a young girl.
The fourth can of beer.
The farmhouse that belonged to the family
and the chickens that were killed for food.
The cactus garden that killed two men when they fell in
and the pieces of green cactus that made them dream.
The green juice that started the earthquake,
the crushed flesh of cactus on their tongues
and its swelling that made them dream.
A garden hose washing away the blood.
The sparrow hovering over the trash can and
the back alley stinking of dog shit and drunken men.
Falling feathers interpreted for what they bring.

A church next door full of sermons and howling black faces.
The corner of the house where a young boy went to hide.
A single strand of hair found in a high school yearbook,
the forgotten idea that hiding it in there would lead to a different life.
The piano wounded by stones falling out of the cottonwood.
The willow tree spreading over the entire front yard
and the tiny white balls of gum that fell out of it one day.

The smell of shadows, trains, humor, tumbleweeds,
ice, empty parking lots, one or two torn knees,
a baseball glove, the first guy to cross the finish line,
the fear, the dread and the skill of escaping
so no one would start a list of smells.

Fear melted the memory of a lost boy.
The old house, the rosary around the neck,
the crushed dog in the road--
a sudden calling from behind to warn him
to come in and be still.
Who recalls how this ended when the men
built their ships and invaded to change the outcome?

The right to cry out and wait a whole century.
The embers, the lone piano, the oil lamps
damaged by a dream.
The ambition in the spine.
Who will insist on tapping the window to show
how easy it is to delay the next hundred years?





Poem (To be read with Philip Glasss String Quartet No. 5)
 

    

Inside the bell jar of the glass factory, 
the girls bend over conveyor belts, lean 
into kilns, bobbing like birds diving for fish. 
One taps a finished porthole window 
with a small silver hammer and 
pronounces it sound (outside
a woodpecker smashes its beak 
into a whitebirch, searching for sap). 
One girl runs her finger down the seam
of a serving plate (outside floodwater
makes a mirror of the meadow). 
Another girl holds a thermometer 
up to the light (the sun has inched up
a few degrees and yes, Monday has a fever). 
Another dips her finger into 
a beaker of water and tests 
that each goblet in the set sings 
a successive note in an E minor scale--
six notes the other girls know so well
that at night, in the dormitory, 
one or all of them can be heard 
hum-dreaming the song in their sleep. 





Since they're not allowed outside--
never have been, never will be--
they used to watch rainstorms 
like television, cross-legged, wiping 
the glass if their breath fogged 
the view. They used to exclaim
over drops of dew. They used to 
run their fingers along the walls, 
searching for a way out, but that only 
smeared the sky. At break they lie 
on their stomachs in the sunroom, 
where they've stacked a wall of cracked
glass hands. Looking through it is the closest
they come to touching the things they see--
the horizon a lifeline across one palm, 
the pine trees in the distance like 
bonsai in tiny finger terrariums. 
Moving things--foxes and half-moons--
slink in and out of adjacent wrists,
slide under successive glass fingernails.
Once a stag walked past and scraped
its antlers along the glass wall. 
They all gasped. It was the closest
they had ever come to another body. 





Now as if their skull walls had 
windows and each brain were 
a clear, crystalline thing, the synapses 
making temporary chandeliers 
of thought-sparks in the brain's 
blank sky, they are all having 
the same idea at the same time--
to make a girl out of glass.  
The sketches start out simple, but soon 
one girl proposes a glass voicebox 
strung with glass chimes, another petitions 
for porthole pupils, a fringe of glass 
lashes on each eyelid's hinge, another 
imagines a mouth made of powdered 
glass and crinkle enamel, and off they go. 
Not one finger here has ever felt fur,
seen veins or bones except under 
the cover of skin, but they bypass 
all that with the force of their dreaming--
how best to make her glass hair seem to 
stream down her back, whose forefinger 
they should choose to dent in her dimples. 




 
The thermometer hits one thousand
degrees and suddenly she's standing there--
hot, glowing, almost still liquid. Like them, 
but unlike too. They don't question that 
she is alive, walking, gesturing. But no one
imagined that she, with her new glass eyes
would be able to see the glass lock
and the glass key. In an instant, she opens
the door and they stream outside into 
the solid world. This isn't at all what 
they imagined. The sky is like lead 
above their heads. The once-silent birds
flood their ears with clashing arias. 
All the puddles on the path are blurred
with mud. The glass girl disappears 
and they don't go after her. When they finally
reach the forest--it is miles further
than they imagined--the air inside is hazy
with dust and spores. They can't see much
beyond their fingers. A bear or maybe 
a deer thuds by. When they come upon 
a stream, for a moment they brighten:
the light prances on its surface like the prisms
they make in the factory, but they can't 
see through to the fish, or the shadows
of fish flitting along the river floor. 





Weeks later, they are back in the factory, 
busily pouring bright liquids from 
one beaker to another, sliding barefoot
between kiln, conveyor belt, workshop. 
Then sleep. In her dreams, the girl who 
has begun building a glass owl 
from the inside-out, starting with 
its morning meal of mouse, will invent
a formula for flight. Another is designing
a glass ladder where each rung has 
a different horizon hidden inside. 
The glass girl could be anywhere. 
She could be just outside, watching
or she could be worlds away, and truly, 
they like it that way. In the hot afternoon, 
the girls melt into various poses by 
the glass walls, molding their memories 
of the outside world into newer, clearer forms. 
One taps a finished porthole window 
with a small silver hammer and pronounces it 
sound. One runs her finger down the seam 
of a serving plate. Another holds a thermometer 
horizontally, and uses its markings to measure 
the height of the trees. The mercury inside 
shivers in the newly imagined breeze. 








My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun (764)
 

My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun - 
In Corners - till a Day 
The Owner passed - identified -
And carried Me away -

And now We roam in Sovreign Woods -
And now We hunt the Doe -
And every time I speak for Him
The Mountains straight reply -

And do I smile, such cordial light
Opon the Valley glow -
It is as a Vesuvian face
Had let it's pleasure through -

And when at Night - Our good Day done -
I guard My Master's Head -
'Tis better than the Eider Duck's
Deep Pillow - to have shared -

To foe of His - I'm deadly foe -
None stir the second time -
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -
Or an emphatic Thumb -

Though I than He - may longer live
He longer must - than I -
For I have but the power to kill,
Without - the power to die -





Walter Llywarch
 

I am, as you know, Walter Llywarch,
Born in Wales of approved parents,
Well goitred, round in the bum,
Sure prey of the slow virus
Bred in quarries of grey rain.

Born in autumn at the right time
For hearing stories from the cracked lips
Of old folk dreaming of summer,
I piled them on to the bare hearth
Of my own fancy to make a blaze
To warm myself, but achieved only
The smoke's acid that brings the smart
Of false tears into the eyes.

Months of fog, months of drizzle;
Thought wrapped in the grey cocoon
Of race, of place, awaiting the sun's
Coming, but when the sun came,
Touching the hills with a hot hand,
Wings were spread only to fly
Round and round in a cramped cage
Or beat in vain at the sky's window.

School in the week, on Sunday chapel:
Tales of a land fairer than this
Were not so tall, for others had proved it
Without the grave's passport, they sent
The fruit home for ourselves to taste.

Walter Llywarch--the words were a name
On a lost letter that never came
For one who waited in the long queue
Of life that wound through a Welsh valley.
I took instead, as others had done
Before, a wife from the back pews
In chapel, rather to share the rain
Of winter evenings, than to intrude
On her pale body; and yet we lay
For warmth together and laughed to hear
Each new child's cry of despair.

Evans? Yes, many a time
I came down his bare flight
Of stairs into the gaunt kitchen
With its wood fire, where crickets sang
Accompaniment to the black kettle's
Whine, and so into the cold
Dark to smother in the thick tide
Of night that drifted about the walls
Of his stark farm on the hill ridge.

It was not the dark filling my eyes
And mouth apalled me; not even the drip
Of rain like blood from the one tree
Weather-tortured. It was the dark
Silting the veins of that sick man
I left stranded upon the vast
And lonely shore of his bleak bed.





Acting
 

Being unwise enough to have married her
I never knew when she was not acting.
I love you' she would say; I heard the audiences
Sigh. I hate you'; I could never be sure
They were still there. She was lovely. I
Was only the looking-glass she made up in.
I husbanded the rippling meadow
Of her body. Their eyes grazed nightly upon it.

Alone now on the brittle platform
Of herself she is playing her last rle.
It is perfect. Never in all her career
Was she so good. And yet the curtain
Has fallen. My charmer, come out from behind
It to take the applause. Look, I am clapping too.





The Untamed
 

My garden is the wild
   Sea of the grass. Her garden
Shelters between walls.
   The tide could break in;
   I should be sorry for this.

There is peace there of a kind,
   Though not the deep peace
Of wild places. Her care
   For green life has enabled
   The weak things to grow.

Despite my first love,
   I take sometimes her hand,
Following straight paths
   Between flowers, the nostril
   Clogged with their thick scent.

The old softness of lawns
   Persuading the slow foot
Leads to defection; the silence
   Holds with its gloved hand
   The wild hawk of the mind.

But not for long, windows,
   Opening in the trees
Call the mind back
   To its true eyrie; I stoop
   Here only in play.





On the Farm
 

There was Dai Puw. He was no good.
They put him in the fields to dock swedes,
And took the knife from him, when he came home
At late evening with a grin
Like the slash of a knife on his face.

There was Llew Puw, and he was no good.
Every evening after the ploughing
With the big tractor he would sit in his chair,
And stare into the tangled fire garden,
Opening his slow lips like a snail.

There was Huw Puw, too. What shall I say?
I have heard him whistling in the hedges
On and on, as though winter
Would never again leave those fields,
And all the trees were deformed.

And lastly there was the girl;
Beauty under some spell of the beast.
Her pale face was the lantern
By which they read in life's dark book
The shrill sentence: God is love.





Ninety-Fifth Street
 

Words can bang around in your head
 Forever, if you let them and you give them room.
 I used to love poetry, and mostly I still do, 
Though sometimes "I, too, dislike it. There must be 
Something real beyond the fiddle and perfunctory
Consolations and the quarrels--as of course
There is, though what it is is difficult to say.
The salt is on the briar rose, the fog is in the fir trees.
I didn't know what it was, and I don't know now,
But it was what I started out to do, and now, a lifetime later,    
All I've really done. The Opening of the Field, 
Roots and Branches, Rivers and Mountains: I sat in my room
Alone, their fragments shored against the ruin or revelation
That was sure to come, breathing in their secret atmosphere,
Repeating them until they almost seemed my own.
We like to think our lives are what they study to become,
And yet so much of life is waiting, waiting on a whim.
So much of what we are is sheer coincidence,
Like a sentence whose significance is retrospective,
Made up out of elementary particles that are in some sense
Simply sounds, like syllables that finally settle into place.
You probably think that this is a poem about poetry 
(And obviously it is), yet its real subject is time, 
For that's what poetry is--a way to live through time 
And sometimes, just for a while, to bring it back.


*     *     *

A paneled dining room in Holder Hall. Stage right, enter twit:
"Mr. Ashbery, I'm your biggest campus fan. We hit it off
And talked about "The Skaters and my preference for "Clepsydra 
Vs. "Fragment. Later on that night John asked me to a party in New York, 
And Saturday, after dinner and a panel on the artist's role as something 
(And a party), driving Lewis's Austin-Healey through the rain 
I sealed our friendship with an accident. The party was on Broadway,
An apartment (white of course, with paintings) just downstairs
From Frank O'Hara's, who finally wandered down. I talked to him
A little about Love Poems (Tentative Title), which pleased him,
And quoted a line from "Poem about the rain, which seemed to please him too.
The party ended, John and I went off to Max's, ordered steaks 
And talked about our mothers. All that talking!--poems and paintings,
Parents, all those parties, and the age of manifestos still to come!
I started coming to New York for lunch. We'd meet at Art News,
Walk to Fifty-sixth Street to Larre's, a restaurant filled with French expatriates,
Have martinis and the prix fixe for $2.50 (!), drink rose de Provence
And talk (of course) about Genet and James and words like "Coca-Cola.
It was an afternoon in May when John brought up a play
That he and Kenneth Koch and Frank O'Hara--Holy Trinity!
(Batman was in vogue)--had started years ago and never finished.
There was a dictator named Edgar and some penicillin,
But that's all I remember. They hadn't actually been together
In years, but planned to finish it that night at John's new apartment
On Ninety-fifth Street, and he said to come by for a drink
Before they ate and got to work. It was a New York dream
Come true: a brownstone floor-through, white and full of paintings
(Naturally), "with a good library and record collection.
John had procured a huge steak, and as I helped him set the table
The doorbell rang and Frank O'Hara, fresh from the museum
And svelte in a hound's tooth sports coat entered, followed shortly
By "excitement-prone Kenneth Koch in somber gray,
And I was one with my immortals. In the small mythologies
We make up out of memories and the flow of time
A few moments remain frozen, though the feel of them is lost,
The feel of talk. It ranged from puns to gossip, always coming back 
To poems and poets. Frank was fiercely loyal to young poets
(Joe Ceravolo's name came up I think), and when I mentioned Lewis
In a way that must have sounded catty, he leapt to his defense,
Leaving me to backtrack in embarrassment and have another drink,
Which is what everyone had. I think you see where it was going:
Conversation drifting into dinner, then I stayed for dinner
And everyone forgot about the play, which was never finished
(Though I think I've seen a fragment of it somewhere). I see a table
In a cone of light, but there's no sound except for Kenneth's 
Deadpan "Love to see a boy eat as I speared a piece of steak;
And then the only voice I'm sure I hear is mine,
As those moments that had once seemed singular and clear
Dissolve into a "general mess of imprecision of feeling
And images, augmented by line breaks. There were phone calls,
Other people arrived, the narrative of the night dissolved
And finally everyone went home. School and spring wound down.
The semester ended, then the weekend that I wrote about in "Sally's Hair
Arrived and went, and then a late-night cruise around Manhattan for a rich friend's
Parents' anniversary bash, followed by an Upper East Side preppie bar
That left me looking for a place to crash, and so I rang John's bell at 2 AM
And failed (thank God) to rouse him, caught a plane to San Diego
The next day, worked at my summer job and worked on poems
And started reading Proust, and got a card one afternoon
From Peter Schjeldahl telling me that Frank O'Hara had been killed.

Ninety-fifth Street soldiered on for several years.
I remember a cocktail party (the symposium of those days),
Followed by dinner just around the corner at Elaine's,
Pre-Woody Allen. It was there I learned of R.F.K.'s assassination
When I woke up on the daybed in the living room, and where
John told me getting married would ruin me as a poet
(I don't know why--most of his friends were married), a judgment
He revised when he met Susan and inscribed The Double Dream of Spring
"If this is all we need fear from spinach, then I don't mind so much
(Which was probably premature--watering his plants one day
She soaked his landlord, Giorgio Cavallon, dozing in the garden below).
It was where Peter Delacorte late one night recited an entire side
Of a Firesign Theatre album from memory, and set John on that path,
To his friends' subsequent dismay, and where he blessed me with his extra copy
Of The Poems, and next day had second thoughts (though I kept it anyway). 
Sometimes a vague, amorphous stretch of years assumes a shape,
And then becomes an age, and then a golden age alive with possibilities,
When change was in the air and you could wander through its streets
As though through Florence and the Renaissance. I know it sounds ridiculous,
But that's the way life flows: in stages that take form in retrospect,
When all the momentary things that occupy the mind from day to day
Have vanished into time, and something takes their place that wasn't there,
A sense of freedom--one which gradually slipped away. The center
Of the conversation moved downtown, the Renaissance gave way to mannerism
As the junior faculty took charge, leaving the emeriti alone and out of it
Of course, lying on the fringes, happily awake; but for the rest 
The laws proscribing what you couldn't do were clear. I got so tired
Of writing all those New York poems (though by then I'd moved to Boston--
To Siena, you might say) that led to nowhere but the next one,
So I started writing poems about whatever moved me: what it's like
To be alive within a world that holds no place for you, yet seems so beautiful;
The feeling of the future, and its disappointments; the trajectory of a life,
That always brought me back to time and memory (I'd finished Proust by then),
And brings me back to this. John finally moved downtown himself,
Into a two-story apartment at Twenty-fifth and Tenth, with a spiral staircase 
Leading to a library, the locus of the incident of Susan, Alydar and John 
And the pitcher of water (I'll draw a veil over it), and Jimmy Schuyler sighing
"It's so beautiful, as Bernadette Peters sang "Raining in My Heart from Dames at Sea.
The poetry still continued--mine and everyone's. I'd added Jimmy 
To my pantheon (as you've probably noticed), but the night in nineteen sixty-six 
Seemed more and more remote: I never saw Kenneth anymore,
And there were new epicenters, with new casts of characters, like Madoo, 
Bob Dash's garden in Sagaponack, and Bill and Willy's loft in Soho.
John moved again, to Twenty-second Street, and Susan and I moved to Milwaukee,
Where our son was born. I stopped coming to New York, and writing poems, 
For several years, while I tried to dream enough philosophy for tenure.
One afternoon in May I found myself at Ninth and Twenty-second,
And as though on cue two people whom I hadn't seen in years--David Kalstone, 
Darragh Park--just happened by, and then I took a taxi down to Soho
To the loft, and then a gallery to hear Joe Brainard read from I Remember,
Back to John's and out to dinner--as though I'd never been away, 
Though it was all too clear I had. Poems were in the air, but theory too, 
And members of the thought police department (who must have also gotten tenure) 
Turned up everywhere, with arguments that poetry was called upon to prove.
It mattered, but in a different way, as though it floated free from poems
And wasn't quite the point. I kept on coming back, as I still do.
Half my life was still to come, and yet the rest was mostly personal:
I got divorced, and Willy killed himself, and here I am now, ready to retire.
There was an obituary in the Times last week for Michael Goldberg,
A painter you'll recall from Frank O'Hara's poems ("Why I Am Not a Painter,
"Ode to Michael Goldberg ('s Birth and Other Births)). I didn't know him,
But a few months after the soiree on Ninety-fifth Street I was at a party
In his studio on the Bowery, which was still his studio when he died.
The New York art world demimonde was there, including nearly everyone
Who's turned up in this poem. I remember staring at a guy who
Looked like something from the Black Lagoon, dancing with a gorgeous
Woman half his age. That's my New York: an island dream
Of personalities and evenings, nights where poetry was second nature
And their lives flowed through it and around it as it gave them life.
O brave new world (now old) that had such people in't!


*     *     *

"The tiresome old man is telling us his life story. 
I guess I am, but that's what poets do--not always 
Quite as obviously as this, and usually more by indirection
And omission, but beneath the poetry lies the singular reality 
And unreality of an individual life. I see it as a long,
Illuminated tunnel, lined with windows giving on the scenes outside--
On Ninety-fifth Street forty years ago. As life goes on
You start to get increasingly distracted by your own reflection
And the darkness gradually becoming visible at the end. 
I try not to look too far ahead, but just to stay here-- 
Quick now, here, now, always--only something pulls me
Back (as they say) to the day, when poems were more like secrets,
With their own vernacular, and you could tell your friends 
By who and what they read. And now John's practically become 
A national treasure, and whenever I look up I think I see him 
Floating in the sky like the Cheshire Cat. I don't know
What to make of it, but it makes me happy--like seeing Kenneth 
Just before he died ("I'm going west John, I'm going west) 
In his apartment on a side street near Columbia, or remembering
Once again that warm spring night in nineteen sixty-six. 
I like to think of them together once again, at the cocktail party
At the end of the mind, where I could blunder in and ruin it one last time.
Meanwhile, on a hillside in the driftless region to the west,
A few miles from the small town where The Straight Story ends,
I'm building a house on a meadow, if I'm permitted to return,
Behind a screen of trees above a lower meadow, with some apple trees
In which the fog collects on autumn afternoons, and a vista
Of an upland pasture without heaviness. I see myself
Sitting on the deck and sipping a martini, as I used to at Larre's, 
In a future that feels almost like a past I'm positive is there-- 
But where? I think my life is still all conversation,
Only now it's with myself. I can see it continuing forever,
Even in my absence, as I close the windows and turn off the lights
And it begins to rain. And then we're there together 
In the house on the meadow, waiting for whatever's left to come
In what's become the near future--two versions of myself 
And of the people that we knew, each one an other
To the other, yet both indelibly there: the twit of twenty
And the aging child of sixty-two, still separate
And searching in the night, listening through the night
To the noise of the rain and memories of rain
And evenings when we'd wander out into the Renaissance,
When I could see you and talk to you and it could still change;
And still there in the morning when the rain has stopped,
And the apples are all getting tinted in the cool light. 





The Fair
 

The idiot goes round and around
With his brother in a bumping car
At the fair. The famous idiot
Smile hangs over the car's edge,
Illuminating nothing. This is mankind
Being taken for a ride by a rich
Relation. The responses are fixed:
Bump, smile; bump, smile. And the current

Is generated by the smooth flow
Of the shillings. This is an orchestra
Of steel with the constant percussion
Of laughter. But where he should be laughing
Too, his features are split open, and look!
Out of the cracks come warm, human tears.





Poste Restante
 

I want you to know how it was,
whether the Cross grinds into dust
under men's wheels or shines brightly
as a monument to a new era.

There was a church and one man
served it, and few worshipped
there in the raw light on the hill
in winter, moving among the stones
fallen about them like the ruins
of a culture they were too weak
to replace, too poor themselves
to do anything but wait
for the ending of a life
they had not asked for.
                                     The priest would come
and pull on the hoarse bell nobody
heard, and enter that place
of darkness, sour with the mould
of the years. And the spider would run
from the chalice, and the wine lie
there for a time, cold and unwanted
by all but he, while the candles
guttered as the wind picked 
at the roof. And he would see
over that bare meal his face
staring at him from the cracked glass
of the window, with the lips moving 
like those of an inhabitant of
a world beyond this.
                                 And so back
to the damp vestry to the book
where he would scratch his name and the date
he could hardly remember, Sunday
by Sunday, while the place sank
to its knees and the earth turned
from season to season like the wheel
of a great foundry to produce
you, friend, who will know what happened.





The Prisoner
 

Poems from prison! About
what?'
            Life and God.' God
in prison? Friend, you trifle
with me. His face, perhaps,
at the bars, fading
like life.'
                  He came in
with the warder, striving
with him. Where else
did the severity of the man
spring from, but awareness
of a charity he must
overcome?'
                   The blows, then,
were God chastening
the beloved! Who
was the more blessed, the
dispenser or receiver
of them?'
                  It is the same
outside. Bars, walls
but make the perspective 
clear. Deus absconditus!
We ransack the heavens,
the distance between
stars; the last place we look
is in prison, his hideout
in flesh and bone.'
                              You believe,
then?'
            The poems
are witness. If his world
contracted, it was to give birth
to the larger vision. Not meadows
empty of him, animal
eyes, impersonal
as glass, communicate
God. On the bare walls
of a cell the oppressor watches
the diminishing of his 
human shadow, as
he withdraws from the light.'





Forest Dwellers
 

Men who have hardly uncurled
from their posture in the 
womb. Naked. Heads bowed, not
in prayer, but in contemplation
of the earth they came from,
that suckled them on the brown
milk that builds bone not brain.

Who called them forth to walk
in the green light, their thoughts
on darkness? Their women,
who are not Madonnas, have babes
at the breast with the wise,
time-ridden faces of the Christ
child in a painting by a Florentine

master. The warriors prepare poison
with love's care for the Sebastians
of their arrows. They have no
God, but follow the contradictions
of a ritual that says
life must die that life
may go on. They wear flowers in their hair.





Threshold
 

I emerge from the mind's
cave into the worse darkness
outside, where things pass and
the Lord is in none of them.

I have heard the still, small voice
and it was that of the bacteria
demolishing my cosmos. I 
have lingered too long on

this threshold, but where can I go?
To look back is to lose the soul
I was leading upwards towards
the light. To look forward? Ah,

what balance is needed at
the edges of such an abyss.
I am alone on the surface
of a turning planet. What

to do but, like Michelangelo's
Adam, put my hand
out into unknown space,
hoping for the reciprocating touch?





Perspectives
 

Primeval

Beasts rearing from green slime--
an illiterate country, unable to read
its own name. Stones moved into position
on the hills' sides; snakes laid their eggs
in their cold shadow. The earth suffered
the sky's shrapnel, bled yellow
into the enraged sea. At night heavily
over the heaving forests the moon
sagged. The ancestors of the tigers
brightened their claws. Such sounds
as there were came from the strong 
torn by the stronger. The dawn tilted
an unpolished mirror for the runt mind
to look at itself in without recognition.


Neolithic

I shall not be here,
and the way things are going
now won't want to be.
Wheels go no faster
than what pulls them. That land
visible over the sea
in clear weather, they say
we will get there some time
soon and take possession
of it. What then? More acres
to cultivate and no markets
for the crops.
                       The young
are not what they were,
smirking at the auspices
of the entrails. Some think
there will be a revival.
I don't believe it. This
plucked music has come 
to stay. The natural breathing
of the pipes was to
a different god. Imagine
depending on the intestines
of a polecat for accompaniment
to one's worship! I have
attended at the sacrifice
of the language that is the liturgy
the priests like, and felt
the draught that was God
leaving. I think some day
there will be nothing left
but to go back to the place
I came from and wrap
myself in the memory
of how I was young
once and under the covenant
of that God not given to folly.


Christian

They were bearded
like the sea they came
from; rang stone bells
for their stone hearers.

Their cells fitted them
like a coffin.
Out of them their prayers
seeped, delicate

flowers where weeds
grew. Their dry bread
broke like a bone.
Wine in the cup

was a blood-stained mirror
for sinners to look
into with one eye
closed, and see themselves forgiven.


Mediaeval

I was my lord's bard,
telling again sweetly
what had been done bloodily.

We lived in a valley;
he had no lady.
Fame was our horizon.

In the spring of the year
the wind brought the news
of a woman's beauty.

Her eyes were still stones
in her smooth-running hair.
Her voice was the birds' envy.

We made a brave foray;
the engagement was furious.
We came back alone.

Sing me, my lord said,
the things nearer home:
my falcons, my horse.

I did so, he listened.
My harp was of fire;
the notes bounced like sparks

off his spirit's anvil.
To-morrow, he promised,
we will ride forth again.


Modern

And the brittle gardens
of Dinorwig, deep
in the fallen petals of
their slate flowers: such the autumn

of a people! Whose spring
is it sleeps in a glass
bulb, ready to astonish us
with its brilliance? Bring

on the dancing girls
of the future, the swaying
pylons with their metal
hair bickering towards England.






Thirteen Blackbirds Look at a Man
 

1

It is calm.
It is as though
we lived in a garden
that had not yet arrived
at the knowledge of
good and evil.
But there is a man in it.


2

There will be
rain falling vertically
from an indifferent
sky. There will stare out
from behind its
bars the face of the man
who is not enjoying it.


3

Nothing higher
than a blackberry
bush. As the sun comes up
fresh, what is the darkness
stretching from horizon
to horizon? It is the shadow
here of the forked man.


4

We have eaten
the blackberries and spat out
the seeds, but they lie
glittering like the eyes of a man.


5 

After we have stopped
singing, the garden is disturbed
by echoes; it is
the man whistling, expecting
everything to come to him.


6

We wipe our beaks
on the branches
wasting the dawn's
jewellery to get rid
of the taste of a man.


7

Neverthless,
which is not the case
with a man, our
bills give us no trouble.


8

Who said the
number was unlucky?
It was a man, who,
trying to pass us,
had his licence endorsed
thirteen times.


9

In the cool
of the day the garden
seems given over
to blackbirds. Yet
we know also that somewhere
there is a man in hiding.


10

To us there are
eggs and there are
blackbirds. But there is the man,
too, trying without feathers
to incubate a solution.


11

We spread our
wings, reticulating
our air-space. A man stands
under us and worries
at his ability to do the same.


12

When night comes
like a visitor
from outer space
we stop our ears
lest we should hear tell
of the man in the moon.


13

Summer is
at an end. The migrants
depart. When they return
in spring to the garden,
will there be a man among them?





Webs and Weeds
 

Sidewalks of webs and weeds
Run parallel to empy lots where foul deeds
By handkerchief heads and winos were played,
To that old house where we stayed.
Irma Jean, Cora Jean and I, three debs,
Against the cracks of weeds and webs.

Sitting through matinees, dodging chores,
Chewing gum; claiming boys were bores.
But secretly grooming hair and breasts;

Jennie's brood, a female nest.
Irma, long-legged, delicious full lips,
Taught Cora and me to wiggle our hips.
George Darlington Love, a beau, my first;
They yelled his name like a tribal curse

As his virginal fingers pressed our bell.
Against that background of sights and smells,
We ignored switchblades, zip guns, and knees
Shattered by cops in that place without trees.
Now memories of dances are sprinkled like seeds
Among cousins and sidewalks of webs and weeds.






Sidewalk Games
 

                                   I

The sidewalks were long where I grew up.
They were as veined as the backs
Of my Grandma's hands.
We knew every inch of pavement;
We jumped the cracks
Chanting rhymes that broke evil spirits,
Played tag at sunset
Among the fireflies and sweet maple trees
Or sang wishful sonnets about boyfriends
To the tune of whipping jump ropes.
The sidewalks wrapped around corners
Like dirty ribbons lacing the old houses
Together in tight knots;
Maple trees bordered
The all-white cemetery.
Sometimes we'd watch Priscilla's uncle
Sway down the dirt alley towards home.
We called her Pussy, called him
Crazy Max.
He was feebleminded and took to fits,
Barely making it from alley to pavement,
Loping down the street like a drunk.
We paced his jagged walk
Against tumbling tunes,
Taunting each pigeon-toed footstep
With rhyme.
The boys      bolder, louder
The girls       tagging along
Braids flopping like twisted hemp,
Ending in brightly colored ribbons.
We turned our black faces into silence
When he finally made it home;
Watched him grope up the broken concrete stairs,
Clutch the wooden railing,
Lunge for the broken screen door
And his medicine.
His tongue flopped wildly,
Parrot noises drowning his sister's cries
As she rushed from the black pit
Of their house.

One day, he leaned away from the safe umbrella
Of his sister's voice;
Leaned into the sky,
Hanging on the porch rail like a rag doll,
Then fell into the cracks of the sidewalk.
We rarely chanted after that,
Always passed Pussy's house in silence.
Sometimes I'd sit in the sweet stillness
Of Grandma's moldy basement
And draw his outline on the wet fuzzy walls.
The grey concrete backdropped my stick figure
As it fell into nothingness.


                                   II

Bumpsy played the Dirty Dozens
As we jackknifed the length of the block,
Forcing grown-ups off the street.
We linked arms like soldiers,
Our black legs scissoring in precision.
    One's a company, two's a crowd
    Three on the sidewalk is not allowed--
    Last night, the night before
    Twenty-four robbers at my door--
    Po-lice, po-lice, do your duty
    Make this boy stop feeling my booty--
    Mary, Mary, tell me true
    Who is the one you love?
Tin soldiers, wooden guns, and sharp tongues.
We got comic books for the price of one
In blitz attacks at Old Man Farrow's dirty store.
Garages were secret places for dirty jokes,
Our folks couldn't afford cars.
When we got older, we played house for real
Until we found Terry's baby sister's body
Behind a stack of tires;
The melodies we'd sung still seemed to bounce
Off the dirty walls and stacks of comic books.


                                  III

Our houses ended at the sidewalk,
Whitewashed steps gleaming like teeth
Against the blocks of grey pavement.
We walked three blocks just to find
A vacant lot to feed Mildred's thirst
For green grass.
Fat Vaughn could eat a whole sheet
Of newspaper in less than three minutes.
Once, I licked the damp cellar wall,
But the taste didn't match the sweet smell.
Ten years later, I searched through Grandma's
Things before they were sold for auction.
I found her picture, three comics and the wind-up
Victrola we had used to put on our version
Of Cotton Club musicals.
We traded days so we could all be stars;
The rest sang chorus until the Victrola
Ran out of steam, the record moaning
Like a sick calf.
I found the stack of old pillows
We collapsed on, giggling and tumbling
Against each other like puppies,
While the needle stuck in one groove
Cutting circles in the records.






Out Here Even Crows Commit Suicide
 

In a world where all the heroes
are pilots with voices like God
he brought her a strand of some woman's

hair to wear on her wing.
She looked sideways at the ground
silent behind the cloudy film covering

her eyes knowing she would be his
forever. They cruised the city nights
each one spiralling away from the other

but always coming home to gather stories.
Dark streets bright tavern lights drunks
filled with beer in the gutters.

The flicker of stars shaped like a hunter's
arrow bent stars that twinkled like babies'
eyes. No babies for them. She was an outcast.

He a loner. A perfect pair.
Winters had made him wise
and he avoided the single nests of summer.

He told her about things she could see.
How the dismal cover of clouds roils and explodes
and the ground aches like an old woman's knee.

How wood rots against the tide
good for hunting grub.
How to fade and fall back into the wind.

He translated her pulse
into near-language. Their poetry so personal
even Peterson's Field Guide could not tap it.

Only a stray hunter saw it.
Shook his head once thinking it a trick
of wind and wing then turned his eyes north

to search for the simple flight
of Brant or Canadian. Those patterns
he could easily understand.

That last night they drank from the river.
Sucked its delicate cusps of mold
sang anti social songs as if they were humans.

When he flicked his handsome head
to catch the drift of wind
she even managed a single tear.

She waited through days and nights 
of grief. Circled the city less
then settled on the wires.

The metallic conductor captured her eyes.
She remembered how he proudly sang her name
as he pranced from pole-top to KV line.

One last fluff of feathers. One sigh
for all the unnested summers.
One single scratch

one electrical surge of power of love.
Then she fell smiling.
A trick he had taught her.





To the Negro Farmers of the United States
 

God washes clean the souls and hearts of you,
His favored ones, whose backs bend o'er the soil,
Which grudging gives to them requite for toil
In sober graces and in vision true.
God places in your hands the pow'r to do
A service sweet. Your gift supreme to foil
The bare-fanged wolves of hunger in the moil
Of Life's activities. Yet all too few
Your glorious band, clean sprung from Nature's heart;
The hope of hungry thousands, in whose breast
Dwells fear that you should fail. God placed no dart
Of war within your hands, but pow'r to start
Tears, praise, love, joy, enwoven in a crest
To crown you glorious, brave ones of the soil.





Lothars Wife
 

he's only a smart-ass when he's home
with Mandrake
he's silent and obedient as a snail
his bald pate bowing into the cape's
trail and dreaming
of tales he'll bore me with
his one night home

once a month 
that's what I get like clockwork
and always on the full moon
half my allowance he reserves
for sheets, tearing them with his teeth
to vent the forced silence
of those other twenty-odd days

did I say odd
it's that one day that's odd
his coming home full of half-tricks
he's picked up from the master
the hypnotic hunger
he so willingly tries on me
he claims he stole me, bought me

claims he's Zulu, Bantu, Beja
depending on the hour, day, or year
says I was the black spot
in the white of his eye
the speck he turned into leopard
that unwittingly turned into woman
neither of us no longer knows what's real

and my mother beats her fat tongue
against her gums
as each month I try to reveal the puzzle
stroking the lines from his hairless
obsidian crown
I hear her rumbling around in the next room
I soothe his sweet head and she moans
heaven protect us from all the things
to which we can become accustomed

The Lights at Carneys Point
 

O white little lights at Carney's Point,
      You shine so clear o'er the Delaware;
When the moon rides high in the silver sky,
      Then you gleam, white gems on the Delaware.
Diamond circlet on a full white throat,
      You laugh your rays on a questioning boat;
Is it peace you dream in your flashing gleam,
      O'er the quiet flow of the Delaware?

And the lights grew dim at the water's brim,
      For the smoke of the mills shredded slow between;
And the smoke was red, as is new bloodshed,
      And the lights went lurid 'neath the livid screen.

O red little lights at Carney's Point,
      You glower so grim o'er the Delaware;
When the moon hides low sombrous clouds below,
      Then you glow like coals o'er the Delaware.
Blood red rubies on a throat of fire,
      You flash through the dusk of a funeral pyre;
And there hearth fires red whom you fear and dread
      O'er the turgid flow of the Delaware?

And the lights gleamed gold o'er the river cold,
      For the murk of the furnace shed a copper veil;
And the veil was grim at the great cloud's brim,
      And the lights went molten, now hot, now pale.

O gold little lights at Carney's Point,
     You gleam so proud o'er the Delaware;
When the moon grows wan in the eastering dawn,
      Then you sparkle gold points o'er the Delaware.
Aureate filagree on a Croesus' brow,
      You hasten the dawn on a gray ship's prow.
Light you streams of gold in the grim ship's hold
      O'er the sullen flow of the Delaware?

And the lights went gray in the ash of day,
      For a quiet Aurora brought a halcyon balm;
And the sun laughed high in the infinite sky,
      And the lights were forgot in the sweet, sane calm.





I Sit and Sew
 

I sit and sew--a useless task it seems,
My hands grown tired, my head weighed down with dreams--
The panoply of war, the martial tred of men,
Grim-faced, stern-eyed, gazing beyond the ken
Of lesser souls, whose eyes have not seen Death,
Nor learned to hold their lives but as a breath--
But--I must sit and sew.

I sit and sew--my heart aches with desire--
That pageant terrible, that fiercely pouring fire
On wasted fields, and writhing grotesque things
Once men. My soul in pity flings
Appealing cries, yearning only to go
There in that holocaust of hell, those fields of woe--
But--I must sit and sew.

The little useless seam, the idle patch;
Why dream I here beneath my homely thatch,
When there they lie in sodden mud and rain,
Pitifully calling me, the quick ones and the slain?
You need me, Christ! It is no roseate dream
That beckons me--this pretty futile seam,
It stifles me--God, must I sit and sew?





You! Inez!
 

Orange gleams athwart a crimson soul
Lambent flames; purple passion lurks
In your dusk eyes.
Red mouth; flower soft,
Your soul leaps up--and flashes
Star-like, white, flame-hot.
Curving arms, encircling a world of love,
You! Stirring the depths of passionate desire!





To Madame Curie
 

Oft have I thrilled at deeds of high emprise,
And yearned to venture into realms unknown,
Thrice blessed she, I deemed, whom God had shown
How to achieve great deeds in woman's guise. 
Yet what discov'ry by expectant eyes
Of foreign shores, could vision half the throne
Full gained by her, whose power fully grown
Exceeds the conquerors of th' uncharted skies?
So would I be this woman whom the world
Avows its benefactor; nobler far,
Than Sybil, Joan, Sappho, or Egypt's queen.
In the alembic forged her shafts and hurled
At pain, diseases, waging a humane war;
Greater than this achievement, none, I ween.





I the People
 

I the people
to the things that are were &
      come to be.
We were once what we know
      when we
make love    When we go away
      from each other because
we have been created
      at 10th & A, in winter &
of trees & of the history of houses
      we hope we are
notes of the musical scale of
      heaven--I the
people so repetitious, & my
      vision of
to hold the neighbors loose-
      ly here in
light of gel, my gel, my vision
      come out of
my eyes to hold you sur-
      round you in
gold & you don't know it
      ever. Everyone
we the people having our
      vision of
gold & silver & silken liquid
      light flowed
from our eyes & caressing
      all around all the
walls. I am a late Pre-
      in this dawn of
We the people
to the things that are & were
      & come to be
Once what we knew was only
      and numbers became
It is numbers & gold & at 10th
      & A you don't 
have to know it ever. Opening
      words that show
Opening words that show that we
      were once
the first to recognize
      the immortality of numbered
bodies. And we are the masters
      of hearing & saying
at the double edge of body & 
      breath
We the lovers & the eyes
All over, inside her
      when the wedding
is over, & the Park "lies cold &
      lifeless
I the people, whatever is said
      by the first
one along, Angel-Agate. I wear
      your colors
I hear what we say & what
      we say . . . (and I
the people am still parted in
      two & would cry)

Kumina
 

for DreamChad on the death of her sun Mark - mark this word mark this place + tyme - at Papine Kingston Jamaica - age 29 midnight 28/29 April   2001-1002-0210-0120-0020-0000rev 29 feb 04
WHAT CAN I SAY BUT THIS MY DARLINGWHAT CAN I DO BUT TRY TO SPEECH MY HEART YR HEART FROM BREAKING.
Kumina is the most African of the [cultural expressions] to be found in Jamaica, with negligible European or Christian influence. Linguistics evidence cites the Kongo as a specific ethnic source for the language' and possibly the music of kumina. There are varying theories as to whether it was brought with late African [arrivants] after Emancipation, or whether it was rooted in Jamaica from the 18th century, and deepened by . . . later African influence.
[Kumina] is to be found primarily in St Thomas and Portland and to a lesser extent in St Mary, St Catherine and Kingston. Kumina ceremonies are usually associated with wakes, entombments or memorial services but can be performed for a whole range of human experiences (births, thankgsiving, invocations for good [or] evil).
Kumina sessions [some extending, as in this poem, to twenty-one days], involve singing, dancing and drumming and are of two general types; bailo the more public and less sacred form of kumina, at which time songs are sung mainly in Jamaican [NL/nation-language]; and country - the more African, and serious form, and at which time possession usually occurs.
Male and female leaders must exhibit great . . . strength in their control of zombies [zambies] or spirits and assume their positions of leadership after careful training in the feeding habits, ritual procedures, dances, rhythms, and songs of a variety of spirits, by a previous King or Captain' . . . Queen or Mother'.
One is said to catch' myal when possessed by one of the threes classes of Gods - sky, earth-bound, and ancestoal [zambies], these last being the most common form of possession. Each god can be recognized by the initiated by the particular dance style exhibted by the possessed, and by songs and drum rhythms [bandu, plain cyas, scrap- ers, gourds, tin-can rattles, catta sticks & bamboo stamping tubes] to which it responds.
At bailo dances, the spirits who are called, more often than not make their presence known by mounting' (i.e. possessing) a dancer; whose given dance style helps in identifying the spirit, but can span all possibilities of movement. The basic dance posture constitutes an almost erect back and propelling actions of the hips as the feet inch along the ground. The dancers move in a circular [anti-clockwise] pattern around the musicians and centre pole, either singly or with a partner. The arms, shoulders, rib-cage and hips are employed, offering the dancers ample opportunity for variations and interpretations of the counter-beats or polyrhythms. Spins, dips, and breaks' on the last beat are common dance variations.
The journey of the spirits from the ethereal to the mundane world is no less ritualised than other kumina elements. Once invoked by music and other ritual paraphernalia (rum with blood, candles, leaves) the spirits are said to hover near the dancing booth [bood]. If successfully enticed they travel down the centre pole in to the ground, then through the open end of the drum to the head of the drum, where the drummer and Queen must salute its presence. The spirit then re-enters the ground, from where it will travel up the feet of the person selected to be possessed, along the whole length of the body, culminating with the full myal possession in the haed of the [transforming] individual.' Anon, Jamaica journal 10: 1 (Kingston 1986) pp6,7]

"painting has no air . . .          --Gertrude Stein
That there should never be air
in a picture surprises me.
It would seem to be only a picture
of a certain kind, a portrait in paper
or glue, somewhere a stickiness
as opposed to a stick-to-it-ness
of another genre. It might be
quite new to do without
that air, or to find oxygen
on the landscape line
like a boat which is an object
or a shoe which never floats
and is stationary.

                              Still there
are certain illnesses that require
air, lots of it. And there are nervous
people who cannot manufacture
enough air and must seek
for it when they don't have plants,
in pictures. There is the mysterious
traveling that one does outside
the cube and this takes place
in air.

                              It is why one develops
an attitude toward roses picked
in the morning air, even roses
without sun shining on them.
The roses of Juan Gris from which
we learn the selflessness of roses
existing perpetually without air,
the lid being down, so to speak,
a 1912 fragrance sifting
to the left corner where we read
"La Merveille and escape.





The Town Dump
 

"The art of our necessities is strange,That can make vile things precious.
A mile out in the marshes, under a sky
Which seems to be always going away
In a hurry, on that Venetian land threaded
With hidden canals, you will find the city
Which seconds ours (so cemeteries, too,
Reflect a town from hillsides out of town),
Where Being most Becomingly ends up
Becoming some more. From cardboard tenements,
Windowed with cellophane, or simply tenting
In paper bags, the angry mackerel eyes
Glare at you out of stove-in, sunken heads
Far from the sea; the lobster, also, lifts
An empty claw in his most minatory
Of gestures; oyster, crab, and mussel shells
Lie here in heaps, savage as money hurled
Away at the gate of hell. If you want results,
These are results.
                          Objects of value or virtue,
However, are also to be picked up here,
Though rarely, lying with bones and rotten meat,
Eggshells and mouldy bread, banana peels
No one will skid on, apple cores that caused
Neither the fall of man nor a theory
Of gravitation. People do throw out
The family pearls by accident, sometimes,
Not often; I've known dealers in antiques
To prowl this place by night, with flashlights, on
The off-chance of somebody's having left
Derelict chairs which will turn out to be
by Hepplewhite, a perfect set of six
Going to show, I guess, that in any sty
Someone's heaven may open and shower down
Riches responsive to the right dream; though
It is a small chance, certainly, that sends
The ghostly dealer, heavy with fly-netting
Over his head, across these hills in darkness,
Stumbling in cut-glass goblets, lacquered cups,
And other products of his dreamy midden
Penciled with light and guarded by the flies.

For there are flies, of course. A dynamo
Composed, by thousands, of our ancient black
Retainers, hums here day and night, steady
As someone telling beads, the hum becoming
A high whine at any disturbance; then, 
Settled again, they shine under the sun
Like oil-drops, or are invisible as night,
By night.
             All this continually smoulders,
Crackles, and smokes with mostly invisible fires
Which, working deep, rarely flash out and flare,
And never finish. Nothing finishes; 
The flies, feeling the heat, keep on the move.

Among the flies, the purefying fires,
The hunters by night, acquainted with the art
Of our necessities, and the new deposits
That each day wastes with treasure, you may say
There should be ratios. You may sum up
The results, if you want results. But I will add
That wild birds, drawn to the carrion and flies,
Assemble in some numbers here, their wings
Shining with light, their flight enviably free,
Their music marvelous, though sad, and strange.





Life Cycle of Common Man
 

Roughly figured, this man of moderate habits,
This average consumer of the middle class,
Consumed in the course of his average life span
Just under half a million cigarettes,
Four thousand fifths of gin and about
A quarter as much vermouth; he drank
Maybe a hundred thousand cups of coffee,
And counting his parents' share it cost
Something like half a million dollars
To put him through life. How many beasts
Died to provide him with meat, belt and shoes
Cannot be certainly said.
                                     But anyhow,
It is in this way that a man travels through time,
Leaving behind him a lengthening trail
Of empty bottles and bones, of broken shoes,
Frayed collars and worn out or outgrown
Diapers and dinnerjackets, silk ties and slickers.

Given the energy and security thus achieved,
He did . . . ? What? The usual things, of course,
The eating, dreaming, drinking and begetting,
And he worked for the money which was to pay
For the eating, et cetera, which were necessary
If he were to go on working for the money, et cetera,
But chiefly he talked. As the bottles and bones
Accumulated behind him, the words proceeded
Steadily from the front of his face as he
Advanced into the silence and made it verbal.
Who can tally the tale of his words? A lifetime
Would barely suffice for their repetition;
If you merely printed all his commas the result
Would be a very large volume, and the number of times
He said "thank you or "very little sugar, please,
Would stagger the imagination. There were also
Witticisms, platitudes, and statements beginning
"It seems to me or "As I always say.
Consider the courage in all that, and behold the man
Walking into deep silence, with the ectoplastic
Cartoon's balloon of speech proceeding
Steadily out of the front of his face, the words
Borne along on the breath which is his spirit
Telling the numberless tale of his untold Word
Which makes the world his apple, and forces him to eat.





The Painter Dreaming in the Scholars House
 

in memory of the painters Paul Klee and Paul Terence Feeley
I

The painter's eye follows relation out.
His work is not to paint the visible,
He says, it is to render visible.

Being a man, and not a god, he stands
Already in a world of sense, from which
He borrows, to begin with, mental things
Chiefly, the abstract elements of language:
The point, the line, the plane, the colors and
The geometric shapes. Of these he spins
Relation out, he weaves its fabric up
So that it speaks darkly, as music does
Singing the secret history of the mind.
And when in this the visible world appears,
As it does do, mountain, flower, cloud, and tree,
All haunted here and there with the human face,
It happens as by accident, although
The accident is of design. It is because
Language first rises from the speechless world
That the painterly intelligence
Can say correctly that he makes his world,
Not imitates the one before his eyes.
Hence the delightsome gardens, the dark shores,
The terrifying forests where nightfall
Enfolds a lost and tired traveler.

And hence the careless crowd deludes itself
By likening his hieroglyphic signs
And secret alphabets to the drawing of a child.
That likeness is significant the other side
Of what they see, for his simplicities
Are not the first ones, but the furthest ones,
Final refinements of his thought made visible.
He is the painter of the human mind
Finding and faithfully reflecting the mindfulness
That is in things, and not the things themselves.

For such a man, art is an act of faith:
Prayer the study of it, as Blake says,
And praise the practice; nor does he divide
Making from teaching, or from theory.
The three are one, and in his hours of art
There shines a happiness through darkest themes,
As though spirit and sense were not at odds.


II

The painter as an allegory of the mind
At genesis. He takes a burlap bag,
Tears it open and tacks it on a stretcher.
He paints it black because, as he has said,
Everything looks different on black.

Suppose the burlap bag to be the universe,
And black because its volume is the void
Before the stars were. At the painter's hand
Volume becomes one-sidedly a surface,
And all his depths are on the face of it.

Against this flat abyss, this groundless ground
Of zero thickness stretched against the cold
Dark silence of the Absolutely Not,
Material worlds arise, the colored earths
And oil of plants that imitate the light.

They imitate the light that is in thought,
For the mind relates to thinking as the eye
Relates to light. Only because the world
Already is a language can the painter speak
According to his grammar of the ground.

It is archaic speech, that has not yet
Divided out its cadences in words;
It is a language for the oldest spells
About how some thoughts rose into the mind
While others, stranger still, sleep in the world.

So grows the garden green, the sun vermilion.
He sees the rose flame up and fade and fall
And be the same rose still, the radiant in red.
He paints his language, and his language is
The theory of what the painter thinks.


III

The painter's eye attends to death and birth
Together, seeing a single energy
Momently manifest in every form,
As in the tree the growing of the tree
Exploding from the seed not more nor less
Than from the void condensing down and in,
Summoning sun and rain. He views the tree,
The great tree standing in the garden, say,
As thrusting downward its vast spread and weight,
Growing its green height from the dark watered earth,
And as suspended weightless in the sky,
Haled forth and held up by the hair of its head.
He follows through the flowing of the forms
From the divisions of the trunk out to
The veinings of the leaf, and the leaf's fall.
His pencil meditates the many in the one
After the method in the confluence of rivers,
The running of ravines on mountainsides,
And in the deltas of the nerves; he sees
How things must be continuous with themselves
As with whole worlds that they themselves are not,
In order that they may be so transformed.
He stands where the eternity of thought
Opens upon perspective time and space;
He watches mind become incarnate; then
               He paints the tree.


IV

These thoughts have chiefly been about the painter Klee,
About how he in our hard time might stand to us
Especially whose lives concern themselves with learning
As patron of the practical intelligence of art,
And thence as model, modest and humorous in sufferings,
For all research that follows spirit where it goes.

That there should be much goodness in the world,
Much kindness and intelligence, candor and charm,
And that it all goes down in the dust after a while,
This is a subject for the steadiest meditations
Of the heart and mind, as for the tears
That clarify the eye toward charity.

So may it be to all of us, that at some times
In this bad time when faith in study seems to fail,
And when impatience in the street and still despair at home
Divide the mind to rule it, there shall be some comfort come
From the remembrance of so deep and clear a life as his
Whom I have thought of, for the wholeness of his mind,
As the painter dreaming in the scholar's house,
His dream an emblem to us of the life of thought,
The same dream that then flared before intelligence
When light first went forth looking for the eye.





From Space to Time
 

on a day when
we were dark
and not so full of
light
we met
    what did we find?
nothing.
everything, when we closed
our eyes
which anyway
had never been open.

once, we thought we
loved each other
       who can reverse
    time?
we tried.
we stepped out
of space
into some new
step of distance
and fell--
and not in love.





Testament
 

child,
in the august of your life
you come barefoot to me
the blisters of events
having worn through to the
soles of your shoes.

it is not the time
this is not the time

there is no such time
to tell you
that some pains ease away
on the ebb & toll of
themselves.
there is no such dream that
can not fail, nor is hope our
only conquest.
we can stand boldly in burdening places (like earth here)
in our blunderings, our bloomings
our palms, flattened upward or pressed,
an unyielding down.





Dirge Without Music
 

I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground.
So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind:
Into the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely.  Crowned
With lilies and with laurel they go; but I am not resigned.

Lovers and thinkers, into the earth with you.
Be one with the dull, the indiscriminate dust.
A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,
A formula, a phrase remains,--but the best is lost.

The answers quick and keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,--
They are gone.  They are gone to feed the roses.  Elegant and curled
Is the blossom.  Fragrant is the blossom.  I know.  But I do not approve. 
More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.

Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave
Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.
I know.  But I do not approve.  And I am not resigned.






Zoom!
 

    It begins as a house, an end terrace
in this case
    but it will not stop there. Soon it is
an avenue
    which cambers arrogantly past the Mechanics' Institute,
turns left
    at the main road without even looking
and quickly it is
    a town with all four major clearing banks,
a daily paper
    and a football team pushing for promotion.

    On it goes, oblivious of the Planning Acts,
the green belts,
    and before we know it it is out of our hands:
city, nation,
    hemisphere, universe, hammering out in all directions
until suddenly,
    mercifully, it is drawn aside through the eye
of a black hole
    and bulleted into a neighbouring galaxy, emerging
smaller and smoother
    than a billiard ball but weighing more than Saturn.

    People stop me in the street, badger me
in the check-out queue
    and ask "What is this, this that is so small
and so very smooth
    but whose mass is greater than the ringed planet?"
It's just words
    I assure them. But they will not have it.






How to Write the Great American Indian Novel
 

All of the Indians must have tragic features: tragic noses, eyes, and arms.
Their hands and fingers must be tragic when they reach for tragic food.

The hero must be a half-breed, half white and half Indian, preferably
from a horse culture. He should often weep alone. That is mandatory.

If the hero is an Indian woman, she is beautiful. She must be slender
and in love with a white man. But if she loves an Indian man

then he must be a half-breed, preferably from a horse culture.
If the Indian woman loves a white man, then he has to be so white

that we can see the blue veins running through his skin like rivers.
When the Indian woman steps out of her dress, the white man gasps

at the endless beauty of her brown skin. She should be compared to nature:
brown hills, mountains, fertile valleys, dewy grass, wind, and clear water.

If she is compared to murky water, however, then she must have a secret.
Indians always have secrets, which are carefully and slowly revealed.

Yet Indian secrets can be disclosed suddenly, like a storm.
Indian men, of course, are storms. They should destroy the lives

of any white women who choose to love them. All white women love
Indian men. That is always the case. White women feign disgust

at the savage in blue jeans and T-shirt, but secretly lust after him.
White women dream about half-breed Indian men from horse cultures.

Indian men are horses, smelling wild and gamey. When the Indian men
unbuttons his pants, the white woman should think of topsoil.

There must be one murder, one suicide, one attempted rape.
Alcohol should be consumed. Cars must be driven at high speeds.

Indians must see visions. White people can have the same visions
if they are in love with Indians. If a white person loves an Indian

then the white person is Indian by proximity. White people must carry
an Indian deep inside themselves. Those interior Indians are half-breed

and obviously from horse cultures. If the interior Indian is male
then he must be a warrior, especially if he is inside a white man.

If the interior Indian is female, then she must be a healer, especially if she is inside
a white woman. Sometimes there are complications.

An Indian man can be hidden inside a white woman. An Indian woman
can be hidden inside a white man. In these rare instances,

everybody is a half-breed struggling to learn more about his or her horse culture.
There must be redemption, of course, and sins must be forgiven.

For this, we need children. A white child and an Indian child, gender
not important, should express deep affection in a childlike way.

In the Great American Indian novel, when it is finally written,
all of the white people will be Indians and all of the Indians will be ghosts.





An Agony. As Now.
 

I am inside someone
who hates me. I look
out from his eyes. Smell
what fouled tunes come in
to his breath. Love his
wretched women.

Slits in the metal, for sun. Where
my eyes sit turning, at the cool air
the glance of light, or hard flesh
rubbed against me, a woman, a man,
without shadow, or voice, or meaning.

This is the enclosure (flesh,
where innocence is a weapon. An
abstraction. Touch. (Not mine.
Or yours, if you are the soul I had
and abandoned when I was blind and had
my enemies carry me as a dead man
(if he is beautiful, or pitied.

It can be pain. (As now, as all his
flesh hurts me.) It can be that. Or 
pain. As when she ran from me into
that forest.
                Or pain, the mind
silver spiraled whirled against the
sun, higher than even old men thought
God would be. Or pain. And the other. The
yes. (Inside his books, his fingers. They 
are withered yellow flowers and were never
beautiful.) The yes. You will, lost soul, say
beauty.' Beauty, practiced, as the tree. The
slow river. A white sun in its wet sentences.

Or, the cold men in their gale. Ecstasy. Flesh
or soul. The yes. (Their robes blown. Their bowls
empty. They chant at my heels, not at yours.) Flesh
or soul, as corrupt. Where the answer moves too quickly.
Where the God is a self, after all.)

Cold air blown through narrow blind eyes. Flesh,
white hot metal. Glows as the day with its sun.
It is a human love, I live inside. A bony skeleton
you recognize as words or simple feeling.

But it has no feeling. As the metal, is hot, it is not,
given to love.

It burns the thing
inside it. And that thing
screams.





On Our Eleventh Anniversary
 

You're telling that story again about your childhood,   
when you were five years old and rode your blue bicycle   

from Copenhagen to Espergaerde, and it was night   
and snowing by the time you arrived,   

and your grandparents were so relieved to see you,   
because all day no one knew where you were,   

you had vanished. We sit at our patio table under a faded green   
umbrella, drinking wine in California's blue autumn,   

red stars of roses along the fence, trellising over the roof   
of our ramshackle garage. Too soon the wine glasses will be empty,   

our stories told, the house covered with pine needles the wind   
has shaken from the trees. Other people will live here.   

We will vanish like children who traveled far in the dark,   
stars of snow in their hair, riding to enchanted Espergaerde.





Walking to School, 1964
 

Blurring the window, the snowflakes' numb white lanterns.   
She's brewed her coffee, in the bathroom sprays cologne   
And sets her lipstick upright on the sink.   
The door ajar, I glimpse the yellow slip,   

The rose-colored birthmark on her shoulder.   
Then she's dressed--the pillbox hat and ersatz fur,   
And I'm dressed too, mummified in stocking cap   
And scarves, and I walk her to the bus stop   

Where she'll leave me for my own walk to school,   
Where she'll board the bus that zigzags to St. Paul   
As I watch her at the window, the paperback   

Romance already open on her lap,   
The bus laboring off into snow, her good-bye kiss   
Still startling my cheek with lipstick trace.





Hurry
 

We stop at the dry cleaners and the grocery store   
and the gas station and the green market and   
Hurry up honey, I say, hurry,   
as she runs along two or three steps behind me   
her blue jacket unzipped and her socks rolled down.   

Where do I want her to hurry to? To her grave?   
To mine? Where one day she might stand all grown?   
Today, when all the errands are finally done, I say to her,   
Honey I'm sorry I keep saying Hurry--   
you walk ahead of me. You be the mother.   

And, Hurry up, she says, over her shoulder, looking    
back at me, laughing. Hurry up now darling, she says,   
hurry, hurry, taking the house keys from my hands.





I Was Always Leaving
 

I was always leaving, I was 
about to get up and go, I was 
on my way, not sure where. 
Somewhere else. Not here. 
Nothing here was good enough. 

It would be better there, where I 
was going. Not sure how or why. 
The dome I cowered under 
would be raised, and I would be released 
into my true life. I would meet there 

the ones I was destined to meet.   
They would make an opening for me 
among the flutes and boulders, 
and I would be taken up. That this 
might be a form of death 

did not occur to me. I only know 
that something held me back, 
a doubt, a debt, a face I could not 
leave behind. When the door 
fell open, I did not go through.





Sustenance
 

Australia. Phillip Island. The Tasman Sea. 
Dusk. The craggy coastline at low tide in fog. 
Two thousand tourists milling in the stands 
as one by one, and then in groups, the fairy penguins 
mass up on the sand like so much sea wrack and 
debris. And then, as on command, the improbable 
parade begins: all day they've been out fishing 
for their chicks, and now, somehow, they find them 
squawking in their burrows in the dunes, one by one, 
two by two, such comical solemnity, as wobbling by 
they catch our eager eyes until we're squawking, too, 
in English, French, and Japanese, Yiddish and Swahili, 
like some happy wedding party brought to tears   
by whatever in the ceremony repairs the rifts 
between us. The rain stops. The fog lifts. Stars. 
And we go home, less hungry, satisfied, to friends 
and family, regurgitating all we've heard and seen.





Green-Striped Melons
 

They lie 
under stars in a field. 
They lie under rain in a field. 
Under sun. 
 
Some people 
are like this as well-- 
like a painting 
hidden beneath another painting. 
 
An unexpected weight 
the sign of their ripeness.





Ode for the American Dead in Asia
 

1.

God love you now, if no one else will ever,
Corpse in the paddy, or dead on a high hill
In the fine and ruinous summer of a war
You never wanted. All your false flags were
Of bravery and ignorance, like grade school maps:
Colors of countries you would never see--
Until that weekend in eternity
When, laughing, well armed, perfectly ready to kill
The world and your brother, the safe commanders sent
You into your future. Oh, dead on a hill,
Dead in a paddy, leeched and tumbled to
A tomb of footnotes. We mourn a changeling: you:
Handselled to poverty and drummed to war
By distinguished masters whom you never knew.

2.

The bee that spins his metal from the sun,
The shy mole drifting like a miner ghost
Through midnight earth--all happy creatures run
As strict as trains on rails the circuits of
Blind instinct. Happy in your summer follies,
You mined a culture that was mined for war:
The state to mold you, church to bless, and always
The elders to confirm you in your ignorance.
No scholar put your thinking cap on nor
Warned that in dead seas fishes died in schools
Before inventing legs to walk the land.
The rulers stuck a tennis racket in your hand,
An Ark against the flood. In time of change
Courage is not enough: the blind mole dies,
And you on your hill, who did not know the rules.

3.

Wet in the windy counties of the dawn
The lone crow skirls his draggled passage home:
And God (whose sparrows fall aslant his gaze,
Like grace or confetti) blinks and he is gone,
And you are gone. Your scarecrow valor grows
And rusts like early lilac while the rose
Blooms in Dakota and the stock exchange 
Flowers. Roses, rents, all things conspire
To crown your death with wreaths of living fire.
And the public mourners come: the politic tear
Is cast in the Forum. But, in another year,
We will mourn you, whose fossil courage fills
The limestone histories: brave: ignorant: amazed:
Dead in the rice paddies, dead on the nameless hills.






Durban, South AfricaSome Notations of Value
 

Metal giraffes march up the bluff
toward the lighthouse. In the moonlight,
whales, or their ghosts, litter the sand.

There is a museum by the park that houses
apartheid; contained in stiff wax dummies.

The tour bus stops on the road's edge.
On the right a black town, the left Indian.
Pointing he says: This is the racial divide.

Stopping at the bar, the drink menu offers--
Red's Divas only five rand each.

Each night the pounding sea reminds me
that, here, women are older than God.

These people carry their dead with them,
plastering them onto every met face.

Yet love hums like turning forks
and the fading spreading sound
is the growth of something more.

Their absence is loud and I long
for the confetti flutter of butterflies.

Abattoirs litter the landscape with the sinister
air of murder, signs proclaiming: Zumba Butchery,
as though this is where the Zumba's blood-
lust got the better of them.

The air conditioner in my room hums
a dirge to a sea too busy spreading rumors.

Death skips between street children
playing hopscotch in the traffic.

The woman singing in Zulu, in a Jamaican bar,
is calling down fire, calling down fire.
There is no contradiction.





The New Religion
 

The body is a nation I have not known.
The pure joy of air: the moment between leaping
from a cliff into the wall of blue below. Like that.
Or to feel the rub of tired lungs against skin-
covered bone, like a hand against the rough of bark.
Like that. "The body is a savage, I said.
For years I said that: the body is a savage.
As if this safety of the mind were virtue
not cowardice. For years I have snubbed
the dark rub of it, said, "I am better, Lord,
I am better, but sometimes, in an unguarded
moment of sun, I remember the cowdung-scent
of my childhood skin thick with dirt and sweat
and the screaming grass.
But this distance I keep is not divine,
for what was Christ if not God's desire
to smell his own armpit? And when I
see him, I know he will smile,
fingers glued to his nose, and say, "Next time
I will send you a down as a dog
to taste this pure hunger.





Hanging in Egypt with Breyten Breytenbach
 

There are stones even here
worn into a malevolence by time
gritting the teeth and tearing
the eyes with the memory.

Out in the desert, the wind
is a sculptor working the ephemera
of sand. Desperately editing steles
to write the names of thousands of slaves
who died to make Pharaoh great.
It is a fool's game.

And we are like the blind musician
at the hotel who tells us with a smile:
I'll see you later.

The guard at the pyramid eyes me.
Are you Egyptian? he demands,
then searches my bag for a bomb.
At the hotel they speak Arabic to me,
don't treat me like the white guests,
and I guess, even here, with all
the hindsight of history we haven't 
learned to love ourselves.

I cannot crawl into the tombs, and cannot
explain why. How do you say: In my country
they buried me alive for six months?
And so you lie and tell yourself this is love.
I am protecting the world from my rage.

Rabab tells me: We know how to build graves
here. I nod. I know. It is the same all over Africa.

Do you have a knife? Do you have one?
the guards at the museum ask Breyten and me,
searching us. We call this on ourselves. We
are clearly political criminals.

I trace the glyphs chipped into stone.
As a writer I am drawn to this. If I could
I too would carve myself into eternity.
Breyten watching me says: Don't tell me
you've found a spelling mistake in it!

A line of miniature statues is placed
into the tomb to serve the pharaoh.
One for each day of the year. Four hundred.
The overseers are a plus. I think
even death will not ease
the lot of the poor here.

Statues: it seems the more I search the world
for differences the more I find it all the same.
Perhaps the Buddha was a jaded traveler too
when he said we are all one.

Mona argues about who should pay
to see the mummies. It isn't often I can
treat a girl to a dead body, Breyten insists.

A woman nearby tells her husand she can see
dead bodies at work. Why pay?
Do you think she works in a hospital? I ask.
That or the U.S. State Department, Breyten agrees.

From the top of Bab Zwelia, flat rooftops
spread out like a conference of coffee tables.
Broken walls, furniture, pots, litter the roofs
like family secrets sunning themselves.
Two white goats on a roof chew
their way through the debris.

On the Nile, Rabab sings in Arabic, tells me
she wants to be Celine Dion.
She is my sister calling me home to Egypt.
Perhaps one day I will be ready.
For now it is enough to know I can
be at home here.





War Widow
 

The telephone never rings. Still
you pick it up, smile into the static,
the breath of those you've loved; long dead.

The leaf you pick from the fall
rises and dips away with every ridge.
Fingers stiff from time, you trace.

Staring off into a distance limned
by cataracts and other collected debris,
you have forgotten none of the long-ago joy
of an ice-cream truck and its summer song.

Between the paving stones;
between tea, a cup, and the sound
of you pouring;
between the time you woke that morning
and the time when the letter came,
a tired sorrow: like an old flagellant
able only to tease with a weak sting.

Riding the elevator all day,
floor after floor after floor,
each stop some small victory whittled
from the hard stone of death, you smile.
They used to write epics about moments like this.





Jubilate Agno, 1975
 

Christopher Smart, 1722-1771Blackula Poland China, 1971-1975(memorandus)
For I will consider my black sow Blackula.
For she is the servant of the god of the feed bucket and serveth him.
For she worships the god in him and the secret of his pail in her way.
For this is done by screams of incantation at the appointed hour and lusty bites of daily communion.
For she stands with forelegs upon the top rail of the wooden fence in supplication.
For she grunts her thanks while she eats.
For she stands for the red boar with closed eyes at the appointed hour.
For having done she lies in the mud to consider herself.
For this she performs in ten degrees.

For eighthly she smells the breeze to ascertain the red boar's presence.
For ninthly she returns to her mud and plows large holes in the earth.
For tenthly she lies again in the wallow to cool her frame.

For like Eve for softness she and sweet attractive Grace was formed.

For one in eight is normally crushed by the sow.
For she is exceedingly good in all that she does.
For she is surely of the tribe of Elephant and forgetteth not.

For a large sow is a term of the Titan Elephant.
For she has the appetite of a bird and would eat the day long which in debt her master suppresses.
For he would not have her too fat or his checkbook hollow.
For he keeps her well-fed and she breaks no fence.
For she grunts in pleasure from the mud when he scratches her ears.
For she is a tool of God to temper his mind.
For when she eats her corn she turns and shits in her trough.
For her master is provoked but hereby learns patience.
For she is an instrument for him to learn bankruptcy upon.
For he lost but four dollars each on the last litter of pigs.
For this is admirable in the world of the bank.
For every man is incomplete without one serious debt or loss.

For she is called Blackula which is a derivative of the Devil, but false.
For she does worship her God and Savior.
For she was given her name for breaking a fence and eating Jan's garden beets.
For when Jan came with a stick and wrath she lifted her head and smiled.
For her teeth and mouth were stained with red beet pulp.
For Jan dropped the stick and laughed.
For she looked like a six-hundred-pound vampire.
For she was called Blackula.
For we feed her red beets daily to watch her smile.
For she is humble when well-fed.
For she makes her point well when she is hungry.
For there is nothing swifter than a sow breaking fence when she desires.
For there is nothing more beautiful than a sow in full run when being chased through a garden.

For the former loses more money than I do on his stock.
For the latter fears her mind.
For she has no wool and will not blindly follow his steps.
For he carries no bucket of feed.
For she litters twice per year.
For he litters but once.
For her belly is firm and can take much abuse.
For from this proceeds her worth.
For I perceive God's mystery by stroking her teats.
For I felt tiny lumps of flesh within and knew they were alive.
For the life is the physical substance which God sends from Heaven to sustain the appetites of men.
For God has blessed her womb and the red boar's seed.
For they multiply in ecstasy at the appointed time.
For God has blessed her in many ways.
For God has given her the red beets to eat.
For God has given the water for her to drink.
For God has allowed the water to run to mud in a place for her to lay.
For she cannot fly to the mountain streams, though she walks well upon the earth.
For she walks the earth heavy upon tiny feet.
For she treads all the rows of the summer garden.
For she can jump the fence.
For she can push it down.
For she can eat.






The Chain Letter (An American Tragedy)
 

Ohdammit sez John I'm in trouble
so I sed why John?
John sez I got the bill for my insurance
and I haven't got no money to pay it
cause I won't get paid for swoking and bailing
Keith Guymon's hay till next week
I done told him that would be just fine
when he ast a week ago but
LaVerne she went and opened the damn envelope
on a chain letter and I aint got no time
to write out twenty copies
I got to get that hay finished
so what am I posta do now?

I sez what John? John sez
it's the damn govament
sends them things out I know it
and it works with the post office and
the insurance to keep you in line
I sez what John?

John sez my brother oncet
he got this chain letter back home
he didn't have no time
to write out his copies neither
it sez he has four days to wrote it
before the luck comes good or bad
it aint never good I heard of
be he forgot
back then it was $5,000 this feller got
in four days and then later
when the govament ruint the money
he put on a zero it was $50,000
and then it was $100,000 
now it sez he got $420,000
it's the same guy it was in
that letter back then
just the numbers changed
it's the way the govament has
to let us know how much
he's gone let the money be worth
but the next day because he hadn't
wrote out his twenty letters
he lost all that money
but my brother he was busy too
he didn't do his letters

the third day after
he had to go kill these pigs
for this man but this other feller
was gone bring his milkcow down
get her bred to my brother's bull
he told him go ahead and do it
he sez he'd have his boy
walk her down the road
it wasn't far
so while my brother was gone
his boy brought her down
turnt her in the corral
he climbt up on the fence to watch

it might of been fine
except the hogs been rooting
up under the barn wall
my brother he borrowed
this lectric fence
he strung it along the side of the barn
so the bull mounts up on the milkcow
she turns and backs him up
against the barn he's stuckt
he gets his back feet
tangled in that lectric fence
one in front and one back
he tries to move and he just tightens
up the lectric wire
that boy he sez you could hear it
zzip zzip zipp that bull
he starts to bellering
milkcow she don't know
what's going on so she backs him up
tighter against the barn
it isn't no way he can get off
he commences to jumping up and down
on her and trying to get his feet
loost of that lectric wire
but he caint it goes zzip
he bellers and she backs up more
it goes zzip again
it was like he was doing a dance
like them crazy people do
trying to get his legs loost
hollering like a sonofabitch

so it was hogs there too
they heard it and here they come
it wasn't natural and a hog
it won't let nothing that's not natural
stay that way around them
it has to get right or go away or die
that boy sez they all run up
grunted and squolt like hell
when that didn't work
this one old mean bitching sow
she run right in between them
she bit that bull right on his seeds
she wanted him to stop acting that way
making all that noise
jumping up and down like that
right now

that bull he just went over backwards
right up against the barn
like he'd been shot in the head
knocked the whole goddam end
of the barn down
fell right on his back
the end rafter come down
on his chest it torn a piece of skin off
his pecker to his seeds
wide as your hand
they swolt up like basketballs
from the hogbite
broke ribs they figured
but it never did kill him
that milkcow she wan't finished
she kept backing up
and fell down right on top of him
it was only the end of the barn
come down the rest stood up
that boy he's ascairt
he got daddy's milkcow up
off my brother's bull he left
he sed he seen enough for oncet

my brother that night
he's coming home from killing them hogs
he never knew none of this happened yet
he's driving see? and he'd lost
his picking finger on his left hand
in the leaf springs of a wagon
when we's kids so
he's driving left-handed
and doing the gears and picking 
with his right hand
it was a moon out so he'd turned off
his pickup lights listening
to the radio because his battery
wasn't much good
he couldn't do both
while he was driving
he couldn't see good as
he thot he could
he hit this big chuckhole
slung him right into the steering wheel
he figured it would of broke his nose
if he hand't been picking
but his hand took the cushion
it only gave him a nosebleed
but almost broke his hand
where it hit
his knuckles was bruised so bad
he couldn't even open and shut
his fingers for a week
he had to drive the rest of the way home
left-handed and lean acrost
and shift with that hand too
he thot the other one was broke
but it wasn't
he got home and the first thing
he seen was the end of his barn out
that bull standing there
inside the barn with his head down low
my brother thot he'd butted it down
he run in the house to get his gun
he was mad he would of kilt that bull
but they told him how it happened
so he didn't
he went out to look
but it wasn't no way they could
get that bull to go back in that yard
where them pigs was
he wouldn't go out the barn
they him him acrost the butt
with a board he'd just stand there
he didn't care no more

they went in the house
my brother he got out the dishpan
and soaked some cold water
so he lain his hand in it
to get the swollen to go down
he wouldn't tell them how it happened
at first but while he was setting there
with his hand ducked
he remembered that chain letter
he jumped up and run to get it
sloshed water all over the kitchen floor
he was hollering how long's it been?
how long's it been?
they sez it happened this morning
it was just his morning
he sez whar? they sez when the sow
bit the bull on his seeds
knocked the barn down
he hollers no not that
how long's it been since I got
this here chain letter in the mail?
they sez oh three days 
he sez goddam I only got one day left

my brother he set up all night
writing out his twenty copies
he had to tape the pencil to his hand
cause it was swole up
his fingers wouldn't bent
they sed he even wrote some
with his left hand
it was so bad you couldn't read the words
he got them all done by sunup
the fourth day like it sed
and took it to the mailbox

he waited all morning on the porch
till they remembered it was Memoral Day
the mail he wouldn't come
my brother he about had a worm
he run out to the mailbox
and got them letters he run over
to his pickup and clumb in
it wouldn't crunk
he'd run the battery down
listening to the radio
goddam my brother he was mad
he busted the side winder
with his head when the pickup
wouldn't turn over
jumped out and slammed the door
so hard it didn't catch
it bounce right back and hit him
right on his swole-up hand
it hurt so bad he sez
he nearly fainted of the pain
he knew he had to get them letters
in the mail
so he walked all the way to town
it was more'n ten miles back then
it worked
nothing else happened
they got the end back in the barn
without it coming down
but they had to shoot the bull finally
and eat him
because he wouldn't do nothing
just set there and waste away
he'd seen enough they guessed
it wasn't no way he'd go
back out there with them pigs
in the corral

since then ever time
we seen a envelope in my family
it looks like it might be a chain letter
we don't open it till we got time
to set down right then
and make out them twenty copies
like it sez to do
but this time LaVerne must of forgot
it snuck up on her
when I got home it was laying
on the table and it wasn't nothing
I could do
it was my name on the envelope

I know it come from the insurance company
it was two years ago the man's wife
from the insurance called
she sez to LaVerne then that she wanted her
to come to her house
she wanted to tell her about selling Amway
LaVerne she sez she wasn't inarrested
a week later here comes
the insurance bill
by god it's gone up almost double
I sez how come you didn't go?
you could of just set and nod
now see what happened?
but it was too late

so I'm gone to have to stay up tonight
writing chain letters
I done wrote one to send to the insurance
so he'll know I did it
and let the govament know
I wrote him a note on the bottom
and sez I'll pay the insurance bill
as soon as I can
but things is tough all over
I just hope he'll understand
I'd as soon right now
rather not have no luck at all
but I am willing to cooperate
if that's what my duty is
as a patriotic American citizen






The Farm
 

We sold it. To a man
who would be a patriarch.
I told John we were closed in,
subdivisions and trailers all around,
complaints of the smell (though
there was none), Ira came out
and told me to keep them fenced
(though none broke out), the neighbors
frightened because someone's cousin's
friend heard of a hog
that ate a child who fell in the pen (though
their children rode my sows
at feeding time), because I was tired,
because Jan carried our child and could
no longer help, because she wanted a home.

And the patriarch lost his first crop
to weeds, threw a rod in the tractor,
dug a basement and moved the trailer on
for extra bedrooms, cut the water lines
for a ditch, subdivided the farm
and sold the pigs for sausage. I told John
they were his, they were no longer mine,
I couldn't be responsible.

The wire connecting our voices was silent
for a moment. "You stupid sonofabitch, was all
he finally said. "You poor stupid bastard.





Fence Repair
 

What's the matter with you today
sed John you and Jan fighting?
On no I said it's not that
it's a letter I got that's bothering me.
Must be from the govament
or the insurance, I can understand that.
No, John, it's not them this time
it's from a friend.
Did he die or summin?
You aint sed a decent word all morning
I might as well be working by myself
and let you set on the nailkeg
unrolling barbwore

Oh dammit, John,
it's just a letter that pissed me off,
I said. It's from a writer who saw something I wrote
about coyotes killing sheep
and he wrote saying that never happens.
He sez what? sez John.
He said there's no documented evidence
that a coyote ever killed a sheep
unless it was rabid, I said.
And he said my story was a lie
and should never have been written.
He's a writer? sez John.
What does he write about?
Oh, he writes novels, I said.
Books about cowboys and Indians 
and the California mountains.

He sez that sed John
did he? You know
most chickens I known of
is layers and most folks
I known is liars
and most of them don't know the different
but that don't get in the way
of their opinions.
It was a preacher
got his first call
to come to our town back home
his first sermon that everbody
showed up to hear
was how all people is good
it aint no such of a thing
as a bad person

he wasn't in town half a year
before Travis Newberry
knocked up his daughter in the eighth grade
and he was twenty-four by then.
He'd started preaching late
after giving up on farming
and owning a grocery store
must of been too late
he run out of words after bout a year
we had to elect him to office
to give him something to do.
First thing he voted no taxes
and no pay raises to schoolteachers
so they all known he'd be a good one
mebbe governor some day
had to move him out
of the parsonage and into a house
where he had to pay rent
like real people
so they found him a place
out on the end of town
where they could be alone
with that pregnant girl
they took out of school.
It was skunks out there
a mama and four babies
and his wife and that girl
sez oh they're purdy
let them alone we like them
so he did
by the time she had her baby
they'd killed all their chickens
the Easter ducks and the cats
it was mice and skunks
running all over that place
they couldn't live there no more
so he run for state office

they sent that girl
off to Christian school
we never heard of her again
and tried to raise the baby boy
but couldn't do that neither.
He got elected
to the campaign of no taxes
and close down the schools
cause he blamed it all 
on Travis Newberry hanging around
the jr-high parking lot
and moved to the state capital
to live and before
they could rent that house again
they had to set out traps
for two months and rat poison
sed they got twenty-four skunks
but nobody counted the mice
it was awful
took a year for the smells
to go off and it wasn't no hippies
back then to rent it to
they had to wait it out

so he run for Warshington office
six years later
and put the boy in the orphanage
up for adoption
he might of been a scandal
but he didn't get elected
they made him a judge instead
after that and he's rich
still there and being so famous
he don't pay no rent
the state gave him a house
and a car and a maid

but that still don't mean he known one damn thing
about people or skunks or mice
or preaching or farming or
running a grocery store.
I seen it with my own eyes
a coyote running through 
a herd of sheep and killed nine lambs
just to do it
and we set up five nights
in our pickups waiting for him
until he come back
and he killed four more
before we shot him
and that's nothing to what
Allen Dalley out to Summit lost
that one year when they say
coyotes got half his lamb crop
that's just a bunch of bullshit
because he done one thing
don't mean he knows nothing
about anothern
and if he doesn't know
what he's talking about
you tell him to just keep his mouth closed
or run for office
that's what it's there for
so why don't you forget about it
and you can forget him too for now
let's get to work
cause all this is real
not something in a book
and has to be got done for sure
not just by thinking about it
and if you don't get that frown put in a drawer
this is gone be a long day of work





Dear Gonglya,
 

The most inscrutable beautiful names in this world
always do sound like diseases.
It's because they are engorged.
G., I am a fool.
What we feel in the solar plexus wrecks us.
Halfway squatting on a crate where feeling happened. Caresses.

You know corporeal gifts besmirch thieves like me.
But she plucks a feather and my steam escapes.
                                                We're awake
each night at pennymoon and we micro and necro.
I can't stop. But love and what-all:
the uncomfortable position of telling the truth,
like the lotus, can't be held long.
                                               If she knew would she
just take all her favors from my marmalade
vessel and chuck them back
into the endless reversible garment which is my life--
                                               an astonishing vanishing.
G., I know this letter is like a slice of elevator accident.
As smart folk would say,
"Everything is only Nothing's Truck.

I would revise it and say that everything is only
nothing, truncated.

Love,

Your Igor





Postfeminism
 

There are two kinds of people, soldiers and women,
as Virginia Woolf said. Both for decoration only.

Now that is too kind. It's technical: virgins and wolves.
We have choices now. Two little girls walk into a bar,

one orders a shirley temple. Shirley Temple's pimp
comes over and says you won't be sorry. She's a fine

piece of work but she don't come cheap. Myself, I'm
in less fear of predators than of walking around

in my mother's body. That's sneaky, that's more
than naked. Let's even it up: you go on fuming in your

gray room. I am voracious alone. Blank and loose,
metallic lingerie. And rare black-tipped cigarettes

in a handmade basket case. Which of us weaves
the world together with a quicker blur of armed

seduction: your war-on-thugs, my body stockings.
Ascetic or carnivore. Men will crack your glaze

even if you leave them before morning. Pigs
ride the sirens in packs. Ah, flesh, technoflesh,

there are two kinds of people. Hot with mixed
light, drunk on insult. You and me.





Project for a Fainting
 

Oh, yes, the rain is sorry. Unfemale, of course, the rain is
with her painted face still plain and with such pixel you'd never see

it in the pure freckling, the lacquer of her. The world
is lighter with her recklessness, a handkerchief so wet it is clear.

To you. My withered place, this frumpy home (nearer
to the body than to evening) miserable beloved. I lie tender

and devout with insomnia, perfect on the center pillow past
midnight, sick with the thought of another year

of waking, solved and happy, it has never been this way! Believe
strangers who say the end is close for what could be closer?

You are my stranger and see how we have closed. On both ends.
Night wets me all night, blind, carried.

And watermarks. The plough of the rough on the slick,
love, a tendency toward fever. To break. To soil.

Would I dance with you? Both forever and rather die.
It would be like dying, yes. Yes I would.

I have loved the slaking of your forgetters, your indifferent
hands on my loosening. Through a thousand panes of glass

not all transparent, and the temperature.
I felt that. What you say is not less than that.





You Love, You Wonder
 

You love a woman and you wonder where she goes all night in some tricked-
out taxicab, with her high heels and her corset and her big, fat mouth.

You love how she only wears her glasses with you, how thick
and cow-eyed she swears it's only ever you she wants to see.

You love her, you want her very ugly. If she is lovely big, you want her
scrawny. If she is perfect lithe, you want her ballooned, a cosmonaut.

How not to love her, her bouillabaisse, her orangina. When you took her
to the doctor the doctor said, "Wow, look at that! and you were proud,

you asshole, you love and that's how you are in love. Any expert, observing
human bodies, can see how she's exceptional, how she ruins us all.

But you really love this woman, how come no one can see this? Everyone must
become suddenly very clumsy at recognizing beauty if you are to keep her.

You don't want to lose anything, at all, ever. You want her sex depilated, you
want everyone else not blind, but perhaps paralyzed, from the eyes down.

You wonder where she goes all night. If she leaves you, you will know
everything about love. If she's leaving you now, you already know it.





The Three-Legged Dog at the Heart of Our Home
 

She dances to the wheeze of my lungs. Were she taller, 
or had she both hind legs, she would lick my aching knees.   
There's nothing like practice I firmly believe. Practice 

makes the heart grow fond. When the graft heals,   
you've apples on a cherry tree, delicious domestic freaks. 

I had a splendid grandmother, I might have made her up.   
She wore cotton dresses, usually blue, and glasses   
with thin gold frames and plastic cushions for the nose.   
The plastic was slightly pink, intended 

to blend with the flesh. She never raised her voice.   
Her knuckles enlarged, her goiter enlarged. 
There are ways within ways. A man will go down   
displaying himself in a nursing home. The mystery left, 

and there's more than when we began, 
has nothing to do with reticence, or safety. 






Epithalament
 

Other weddings are so shrewd on the sofa, short
and baffled, bassett-legged. All things

knuckled, I have no winter left, in my sore rememory,
to melt down for drinking water. Shrunk down.

Your wedding slides the way wiry dark hairs do, down
a swimming pool drain. So I am drained.

Sincerely. I wish you every chapped bird on this
pilgrimage to hold your hem up from the dust.

Dust is plural: infinite dust. I will sink in the sun,
I will crawl towards the heavy drawing

and design the curtains in the room
of never marrying you. Because it is a sinking,

because today's perfect weather is a later life's
smut. This soiled future unplans love.

I keep unplanning the same Sunday. Leg
and flower, breeze and terrier, I have no garden

and couldn't be happier. Please, don't lose me
here. I am sorry my clutch is all

tendon and no discipline: the heart is a severed
kind of muscle and alone.

I can hear yours in your room. I hear mine
in another room. In another's.





Cautionary Tales
 

Beyond the field of grazing, gazing cows 
the great bull has a pasture to himself, 
monumental, black flanks barely twitching 
from the swarming flies. Only a few strands of 
wire separate us--how could I forget 
my childhood terror, the grownups warning 
that the old bull near my uncle's farm 
would love to chase me, stomp me, gore me 
if I ever got too close. And so I 
skirted acres just to keep my distance, 
peeking through the leaves to see if he still 
was watching me, waiting for some foolish move-- 
those fierce red eyes, the thunder in the ground-- 
or maybe that was simply nightmares. It's 
getting hard to tell, as years themselves keep 
gaining ground relentlessly, their hot breath 
on my back, and not a fence in sight.





To David, About His Education
 

The world is full of mostly invisible things,
And there is no way but putting the mind's eye,
Or its nose, in a book, to find them out,
Things like the square root of Everest
Or how many times Byron goes into Texas,
Or whether the law of the excluded middle
Applies west of the Rockies. For these
And the like reasons, you have to go to school
And study books and listen to what you are told,
And sometimes try to remember. Though I don't know
What you will do with the mean annual rainfall
On Plato's Republic, or the calorie content
Of the Diet of Worms, such things are said to be 
Good for you, and you will have to learn them
In order to become one of the grown-ups
Who sees invisible things neither steadily nor whole,
But keeps gravely the grand confusion of the world
Under his hat, which is where it belongs,
And teaches small children to do this in their turn. 






The Local Language
 

The way she puts her fingers to his chest when she greets him.

The way an old man quiets himself,

or that another man waits, and waits a long time, before speaking.
It's in the gaze that steadies, a music

he grows into--something about
Mexico, I imagine, how he first learned about light there.

It's in the blank face of every child,
a water that stands still amid the swirling current,

water breaking apart as it leaves the cliff and falls forever
through its own, magnificient window.

The way a young woman holds out a cupped hand, and doves come to her.

The way a man storms down the street as if to throw open every door.

And the word she mouths to herself as she looks up from her book--for
that word, as she repeats it,

repeats it.





Alpine Wedding
 

All dark morning long the clouds are rising slowly up
beneath us, and we are fast asleep.
The mountains unmove

intensely. And so do we. Meadows
look down.

A city there looks up and
stirs a little. Adrift the rolling tiled roofs of
buildings, the deadly

trains of grinding sand and morning--
a spy unfolds his paper,

the coffee's served.

A bride and groom stand shivering on a tarmac
in the mist, and 
they are happy. Each one

and all of us entangled, the room is moist with us,
the house unfinished, windowless,

and we are fast asleep.

The brother of the groom can't get
close enough. He leans against the brightest ridge
and ladder, the sucking

sound of memory
as heaven picks up speed and

hurtles through his burning skin
its frozen blankets
to the sun.





Subway Wind
 

Far down, down through the city's great gaunt gut
      The gray train rushing bears the weary wind;
In the packed cars the fans the crowd's breath cut,
      Leaving the sick and heavy air behind.
And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door
      To give their summer jackets to the breeze;
Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar
      Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas;
Seas cooling warm where native schooners drift
      Through sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep,
Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift
      Lightly among the islands of the deep;
Islands of lofy palm trees blooming white
      That led their perfume to the tropic sea,
Where fields lie idle in the dew-drenched night,
      And the Trades float above them fresh and free.





After the Winter
 

Some day, when trees have shed their leaves
     And against the morning's white
The shivering birds beneath the eaves
     Have sheltered for the night,
We'll turn our faces southward, love,
     Toward the summer isle
Where bamboos spire the shafted grove
     And wide-mouthed orchids smile.

And we will seek the quiet hill
     Where towers the cotton tree,
And leaps the laughing crystal rill,
     And works the droning bee.
And we will build a cottage there
     Beside an open glade,
With black-ribbed blue-bells blowing near,
     And ferns that never fade.





Self-Portrait
 

I see myself in the shadows of a leaf
compressed to the green blades growing
to a point like the shards of miles of mirrors
falling and cracking to perfect gardens.

I never inspect the withered assumption
of my face's petty dialogue in raindrops,
the deceptive spreading of the words
oozing from the skin to the edges of water
etched on the ground by gravity and wishing.

Passing for the seriousness of my eye,
platitudes of my white collar or
the perfect posture of my lips, it skirts
from the leaves of the plant hiding me
and sits stoic like stone in my pupil,
mute and unassuming, like Rashi.

To gather myself I will swim naked
in the wind, bending my blind elbows
in circles, stopping now to dance
like the cherubic gold on the ark,
and gather myself from the particles
of this excitement another structure,
one closely resembling the beginning.





Inside the Blues Whale
 

1978-1979for Vincent Woodard
It is not just my problem. It belongs
to us all. I have been cajoled into
coming to the emergency room where
everything scares me. Black folk
shoot and cut each other until they end
here where guards have guns. I refuse
to be taken upstairs and locked away.
I was trying to think of a poem. It got me
to this place. With my mother, I stand
against the wall, guards on either side.
They have guns, and this is my mother.
It is now everybody's problem. A bird
is singing in my hair, more important
than Thorazine. My head is a tree
stretching its leaves to burn in the sun.
They say if I make a treaty to take
the medicine, I can leave with my family
since my family is crazy. I look at the guns
on the hips of the guards and know I must
be as still and quiet as death or this will
turn into psychosis as sick as nightmares.
I am angry that they would have me here
with my mother, angry at white doctors.
I am in a whale in the ocean. Who can
swim out to me? Who can cast a line?
If I take out the first guard by breaking
his neck, I can protect my mother, but
it is more important that we are all now
underwater, inside a whale who laughs.
Later the therapist they say likes me
keeps talking about the appointment.
She is doing something subliminal with
the word "come, repeating, repeating.
She leans to me when she says it.
It bothers me that such people think
crazy people are stupid, but it is more
important that my head is a tree
with a bird singing in it inside a whale
in the ocean. The most important thing
of all is that this whale that ate us
likes to laugh a lot. He has the blues.





Memorandum
 

Save these words for a while because
of something they remind you of
although you cannot remember
what that is a sense that is part
dust and part the light of morning

you were about to say a name
and it is not there I forget
them too I am learning to pray
to Perdita to whom I said
nothing at the time and now she
cannot hear me as far as I
know but the day goes on looking

the names often change more slowly
than the meanings whole families
grow up in them and then are gone
into the anonymous sky
oh Perdita does the hope go on
after the names are forgotten

and is the pain of the past done
when the calling has stopped and those
betrayals so long repeated
that they are taken for granted
as the shepherd does with the sheep





Night Singing
 

Long after Ovid's story of Philomela
      has gone out of fashion and after the testimonials
of Hafiz and Keats have been smothered in comment
      and droned dead in schools and after Eliot has gone home
from the Sacred Heart and Ransom has spat and consigned
      to human youth what he reduced to fairy numbers
after the name has become slightly embarrassing
      and dried skins have yielded their details and tapes have been
slowed and analyzed and there is nothing at all
      for me to say one nightingale is singing
nearby in the oaks where I can see nothing but darkness
      and can only listen and ride out on the long note's
invisible beam that wells up and bursts from its
      unknown star on on on never returning
never the same never caught while through the small leaves
      of May the starlight glitters from its own journeys
once in the ancestry of this song my mother visited here
      lightning struck the locomotive in the mountains
it had never happened before and there were so many
      things to tell that she had just seen and would never
have imagined now a field away I hear another
      voice beginning and on the slope there is a third
not echoing but varying after the lives
      after the goodbyes after the faces and the light
after the recognitions and the touching and tears
      those voices go on rising if I knew I would hear
in the last dark that singing I know how I would listen





Vixen
 

Comet of stillness princess of what is over
       high note held without trembling without voice without sound
aura of complete darkness keeper of the kept secrets
       of the destroyed stories the escaped dreams the sentences
never caught in words warden of where the river went
       touch of its surface sibyl of the extinguished
window onto the hidden place and the other time
       at the foot of the wall by the road patient without waiting
in the full moonlight of autumn at the hour when I was born
       you no longer go out like a flame at the sight of me
you are still warmer than the moonlight gleaming on you
       even now you are unharmed even now perfect
as you have always been now when your light paws are running
       on the breathless night on the bridge with one end I remember you
when I have heard you the soles of my feet have made answer
       when I have seen you I have waked and slipped from the calendars
from the creeds of difference and the contradictions
       that were my life and all the crumbling fabrications
as long as it lasted until something that we were
       had ended when you are no longer anything
let me catch sight of you again going over the wall
       and before the garden is extinct and the woods are figures
guttering on a screen let my words find their own
      places in the silence after the animals

   "Stay your rude steps; whose throbbing breasts infold
The legion-fiends of Glory, or of Gold!
Stay! whose false lips seductive simpers part,
While Cunning nestles in the harlot-heart!--
For you no Dryads dress the roseate bower,
For you no Nymphs their sparkling vases pour;
Unmark'd by you, light Graces swim the green,
And hovering Cupids aim their shafts, unseen.

   "But Thou! whose mind the well-attemper'd ray
Of Taste and Virtue lights with purer day;
Whose finer sense each soft vibration owns
With sweet responsive sympathy of tones;
So the fair flower expands its lucid form
To meet the sun, and shuts it to the storm;--
For thee my borders nurse the fragrant wreath,
My fountains murmur, and my zephyrs breathe;
Slow slides the painted snail, the gilded fly
Smooths his fine down, to charm thy curious eye;
On twinkling fins my pearly nations play,
Or win the sinuous train their trackless way;
My plumy pairs, in gay embroidery dress'd,
Form with ingenious bill the pensile nest,
To Love's sweet notes attune the listening dell,
And Echo sounds her soft symphonious shell.

   "And, if with Thee some hapless Maid should stray
Disastrous Love companion of her way,
Oh, lead her timid steps to yonder glade,
Whose arching cliffs depending alders shade;
There, as meek Evening wakes her temperate breeze,
And moon-beams glimmer through the trembling trees,
The rills, that gurgle-round, shall sooth her ear,
The weeping rocks shall number tear for tear;
There as sad philomel, alike forlorn,
Sings to the night from her accustomed thorn;
While at sweet intervals each falling note
Sighs in the gale, and whispers round the grot;
The sister-wo shall calm her aching breast,
And softer slumbers steal her cares to rest.--

   "Winds of the north! restrain your icy gales,
Nor chill the bosom of these happy vales!
Hence in dark heaps, ye gathering clouds, revolve!
Disperse, ye lightnings! and, ye mists, dissolve!
--Hither, emerging from yon orient skies,
Botanic Goddess! bend thy radiant eyes;
O'er these soft scenes assume thy gentle reign,
Pomona, Ceres, Flora in thy train;
O'er the still dawn thy placid smile effuse,
And with thy silver sandals print the dews;
In noon's bright blaze thy vermil vest unfold,
And wave thy emerald banner starr'd with gold.
   Thus spoke the Genius, as he stepp'd along,
And bade these lawns to Peace and Truth belong;
Down the steep slopes he led with modest skill;
The willing pathway, and the truant rill,
Stretch'd o'er the marshy vale yon willowy mound,
Where shines the lake amid the tufted ground,
Raised the young woodland, smooth'd the wavy green,
And gave to Beauty all the quiet scene.--

   She comes!--the Goddess!--through the whispering air,
Bright as the morn, descends her blushing car;
Each circling wheel a wreath of flowers entwines,
And gemm'd with flowers the silken harness shines;
The golden bits with flowery studs are deck'd,
And knots of flowers the crimson reins connect.--
And now on earth the silver axle rings,
And the shell sinks upon its slender springs;
Light from her airy seat the Goddess bounds,
And steps celestial press the pansied grounds.

   Fair Spring advancing calls her feather'd choir,
And tunes to softer notes her laughing lyre;
Bids her gay hours on purple pinions move,
And arms her Zephyrs with the shafts of Love,
Pleased Gnomes, ascending from their earthy beds,
Play round her graceful footsteps, as she treads;
Gay Sylphs attendant beat the fragrant air
On winnowing wings, and waft her golden hair;
Blue Nymphs emerging leave their sparkling streams,
And Fiery Forms alight from orient beams;
Musk'd in the rose's lap fresh dews they shed,
Or breathe celestial lustres round her head.

   First the fine forms her dulcet voice requires,
Which bathe or bask in elemental fires;
From each bring gem of Day's refulgent car,
From the pale sphere of every twinkling star,
From each nice pore of ocean, earth, and air,
With eye of flame the sparkling hosts repair,
Mix their gay hues, in changeful circles play,
Like motes, that tenant the meridian ray.--
So the clear Lens collects with magic power
The countless glories of the midnight hour;
Stars after stars with quivering lustre fall,
And twinkling glide along the whiten'd wall.--
Pleased, as they pass, she counts the glittering bands,
And stills their murmur with her waving hands;
Each listening tribe with fond expectance burns,
And now to these, and now to those, she turns.

   I. "Nymphs of primeval fire! your vestal train
Hung with gold-tresses o'er the vast inane,
Pierced with your silver shafts the throne of night,
And charm'd young Nature's opening eyes with light;
When Love Divine, with brooding wings unfurl'd,
Call'd from the rude abyss the living world.
--Let there be light!' proclaim'd the Almighty Lord,
Astonish'd Chaos heard the potent word;
Through all his realms the kindling ether runs,
And the mass starts into a million suns;
Earths round each sun with quick explosions burst,
And second planets issue from the first;
Bend, as they journey with projectile force,
In bright ellipses their reluctant course;
Orbs wheel in orbs, round centres centres roll,
And form, self-balanced, one revolving whole.
--Onward they move amid their bright abode,
Space without bound, the bosom of their God!

   II. "Ethereal Powers! you chase the shooting stars,
Or yoke the vollied lightnings to your cars,
Cling round the arial bow with prisms bright,
And pleased untwist the sevenfold threads of light;
Eve's silken couch with gorgeous tints adorn,
And fire the arrowy throne of rising Morn.
--Or, plumed with flame, in gay battalions spring
To brighter regions borne on broader wing;
Where lighter gases, circumfused on high,
Form the vast concave of exterior sky;
With airy lens the scatter'd rays assult,
And bend the twilight round the dusky vault;
Ride, with broad eye and scintillating hair,
The rapid fire-ball through the midnight air;
Dart from the north on pale electric streams,
Fringing Night's sable robe with transient beams.
--Or rein the planets in their swift careers,
Gilding with borrow'd light their twinkling spheres;
Alarm with comet-blaze the sapphire plain,
The wan stars glimmering through its sliver train;
Gem the bright zodiac, stud the glowing pole,
Or give the sun's phlogistic orb to roll.

   III. 1. "Nymphs! your fine forms with steps impassive mock
Earth's vaulted roofs of adamantine rock;
Round her still centre tread the burning soil,
And watch the billowy lavas, as they boil;
Where, in basaltic caves imprisoned deep,
Reluctant fires in dread suspension sleep;
Or sphere on sphere in widening waves expand,
And glad with genial warmth the incumbent land.
Thus when the mother-bird on moss-wove nest
Lulls her fond brood beneath her plumy breast;
Warmth from her tender heart diffusive springs,
And charm'd she shields them with diverging wings.

   2. "You from deep cauldrons and unmeasured caves
Blow flaming airs, or pour vitrescent waves;
O'er shining oceans ray volcanic light,
Or hurl innocuous embers to the night.
While with loud shouts to Etna Hecla calls,
And Andes answers from his beacon'd walls;
Sea-wilder'd crews the mountain-stars admire,
And beauty beams amid terrific fire.

   "Thus when of old, as mystic bards presume,
Huge Cyclops dwelt in Etna's rocky womb,
On thundering anvils rung their loud alarms,
And leagued with Vulcan forged immortal arms;
Descending Venus sought the dark abode,
And sooth'd the labours of the grisly god.--
While frowning loves the threatening falchion wield,
And tittering graces peep behind the shield,
With jointed mail their fairy limbs o'erwhelm,
Or nod with pausing step the plumed helm;
With radiant eye she view'd the boiling ore,
Heard undismay'd the breathing bellows roar,
Admired their sinewy arms, and shoulders bare,
And ponderous hammers lifted high in air,
With smiles celestial bless'd their dazzled sight,
And beauty blazed amid infernal night.

   IV. 1. "Effulgent maids! you round deciduous day,
Tress'd with soft beams, your glittering bands array;
On earth's cold bosom, as the sun retires,
Confine with folds of air the lingering fires; 
O'er Eve's pale forms diffuse phosphoric light,
And deck with lambent flames the shrine of night.
So, warm'd and kindled by meridian skies,
And view'd in darkness with dilated eyes,
Bologna's chalks with faint ignition blaze,
Beccari's shells emit prismatic rays.
So to the sacred sun in Memnon's fane,
Spontaneous concords quired the matin strain;
--Touch'd by his orient beam, responsive rings
The living lyre, and vibrates all its strings;
Accordant aisles the tender tones prolong,
And holy echoes swell the adoring song.

   "You with light gas the lamps noctural feed,
Which dance and glimmer o'er the marshy mead;
Shine round Calendula at twilight hours,
And tip with silver all her saffron flowers;
Warm on her mossy couch the radiant worm,
Guard from cold dews her love-illumined form,
From leaf to leaf conduct the virgin light,
Star of the earth, and diamond of the night.
You bid in air the tropic beetle burn,
And fill with golden flame his winged urn;
Or gild the surge with insect-sparks, that swarm
Round the bright oar, the kindling prow alarm;
Or arm in waves, electric in his ire,
The dread Gymnotus with ethereal fire.--
Onward his course with waving tail he helms,
And mimic lightnings scare the watery realms. 
So, when with bristling plumes the bird of Jove
Vindictive leaves the argent fields above,
Borne on broad wings the guilty world he awes,
And grasps the lightning in his shining claws.

   V. 1. "Nymphs! your soft smiles uncultured man subdued,
And charm'd the savage from his native wood;
You, while amazed his hurrying hoards retire
From the fell havoc of devouring fire,
Taught the first art! with piny rods to raise
By quick attrition the domestic blaze,
Fan with soft breath, with kindling leaves provide
And list the dread destroyer on his side.
So, with bright wreath of serpent tresses crown'd,
Severe in beauty, young Medusa frown'd;
Erstwhile subdued, round Wisdom's gis roll'd
Hiss'd the dread snakes, and flamed in burnish'd gold;
Flash'd on her brandish'd arm the immortal shield,
And terror lighten'd o'er the dazzled field.

   2. "Nymphs! you disjoin, unite, condense, expand,
And give new wonders to the chemist's hand;
On tepid clouds the rising steam aspire,
Or fix in sulphur all its solid fire;
With boundless spring elastic airs unfold,
Or fill the fine vacuities of gold;
With sudden flash vitrescent sparks reveal,
By fierce collision from the flint and steel;
Or mark with shining letters Kunkel's name
In the pale phosphor's self-consuming flame.
So the chaste heart of some enchanted maid
Shines with insidious light, by love betray'd;
Round her pale bosom plays the young desire,
And slow she wastes by self-consuming fire.

   3. "You taught mysterious Bacon to explore
Metallic veins, and part the dross from ore;
With sylvan coal in whirling mills combine
The crystal'd nitre, and the sulphurous mine;
Through wiry nets the black diffusion strain,
And close an airy ocean in a grain.--
Pent in dark chambers of cylindric brass,
Slumbers in grim repose the sooty mass;
Lit by the brilliant spark, from grain to grain
Runs the quick fire along the kindling train;
On the pain'd ear-drum bursts the sudden crash
Starts the red-flame, and death pursues the flash.--
Fear's feeble hand directs the fiery darts, 
And strength and courage yield to chemic arts;
Guilt with pale brow the mimic thunder owns,
And tyrants tremble on their blood-stain'd thrones.






A March in the Ranks Hard-Prest, and the Road Unknown
 

A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,
A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,
Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,
Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building,
We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted building,
'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu hospital
Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made,
Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,
And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke,
By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in the pews laid down,
At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)
I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as a lily,)
Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it all,
Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity, some of them dead,
Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, the odor of blood,
The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill'd,
Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the death-spasm sweating,
An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,
The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the torches,
These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,
Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;
But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,
Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,
Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,
The unknown road still marching.





A Dream Within a Dream
 

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow --
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?  
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand --
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep -- while I weep!
O God! Can I not grasp 
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?






Full Moon
 

My bands of silk and miniver
Momently grew heavier;
The black gauze was beggarly thin;
The ermine muffled mouth and chin;
I could not suck the moonlight in.

Harlequin in lozenges
Of love and hate, I walked in these
Striped and ragged rigmaroles;
Along the pavement my footsoles
Trod warily on living coals.

Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,
In their corrupt disguises clothed,
Morality I could not tear
From my ribs, to leave them bare
Ivory in silver air.

There I walked, and there I raged;
The spiritual savage caged
Within my skeleton, raged afresh
To feel, behind a carnal mesh,
The clean bones crying in the flesh.






Unholy Women
 

                     But of course these poems are

about men,

          which we become by defining how
we are not women

                               and
                                         
                                          so becoming

a shadow devouring the light to find the limits

          which is what Richard Pryor would have told Joan of Arc
in a joke funnier for being sexist

                     "It's a man thang.

And of course there is God

                     and its problematic relationship to light

not to mention the question
                                          
                                          of permission

                                Who builds the box, the shape?

It makes sense that Jesus, the new man 2,000 years ago

          was a carpenter.

You need that craft, the precision of measurement

                     angles of angels

who incidentally are never women.

          Just ask the Romans, who called them Angelo, Angelus

                     never Angela--

                     that lie was coined by a dissident nun hiding
her feminism under the cover of rapture

but

                     is it enough to announce yourself?
To beat your chest in contrition calling

          Mea culpa! Mea culpa?

Guilt can never be enough
          Mere intent--where is its purpose?

                     Yet there are no answers

there are only lines that disappear

          into horizons that girder us with safety

                     just as there is no way to end this poem.






In the Middle of Dinner
 

my mother put down her knife and fork,
pulled her wedding ring from its groove,
placing it contemplatively on her middle
finger. So natural was the move,
so tender, I almost didn't notice.
Five years, she said, five years, once a week,
I wrote a letter to your father. And waited
until time was like ash on my tongue.
Not one letter back, not a single note.
She sighed, smiling, the weight gone. This
prime rib is really tender, isn't it? she asked.






Dog Woman
 

It's like flying in your dreams, she said. You empty
Yourself out and just lift off. Soar. It's like that.

                                       *

Red.               Red.                Red.

          Just that word. Sometimes.

                                       *

Yang & Yin. Like twins tumbling through summer.
        He, the rooster crowing sun; desperate--afraid--
                   As only men can be.

And Yin? Let's say she has long hair--
          No, that won't work. If we are to believe
the ancient Chinese, she was a dog
                          howling moon.

                                       *

When I counted out the pills, it was a slowing down.
          Like the delay between when the car goes through
the dip and your stomach falls away--
                          And won't stop.

                                       *

Of course it was because she didn't fit my mold.
So I punished her. And why? And why? And why?
          You did it, I said. You did it.
Wouldn't fill my world.

                                       *

And eventually we all kill our mothers.
Their eyes a tenderness that doesn't flinch
          from it. Knowing. Eventually.
        
                                       *

What else is there?

                                       *

Paula's paintings are real. The women thick, visceral,
like stubborn cliffs the sea cannot contain--or drown.

                                       *

Or dogs. And such as these drove Homer to despair--
And his cry: Oh to see! To see! To see!

                                       *

So Paula says: To be a dog woman is bestial is good.
          Eating, snarling.
Utterly believable.
                                   Gross.

                                       *

Like when Cesaria Evora breaks your heart with a smile
          all melancholy and sea and salt.

                                   Assim 'm ta pidi mar
                                   Pa 'l leva 'me pa 'me ca voeta

And it doesn't matter that you don't know what
          the words mean. Some things are beyond that.

                                       *

So. Tanya bought the record because Cesaria's face
          is beautiful with all the lost love of the world
and darker than the blue of the sun setting over the Atlantic.

                                       *

It's in the angle of light washing her hair
with sun into a puddle that catches in the throat

The wood deck creaks from the weight
of all that air and sun and silence
Water chuckling in the tiny fountain in the corner
holding up the song of wind chimes and flies

And it's all here. Fire. Water. Stone. Wood.

                                       *

All caught up in Yeats and the cuckoo
          that wasn't a real bird but cried
with all the agony of the desire for flight
hemmed by wooden wings, and springs and cogs.

I think.

                                       *

Or looking for Rilke--
          How the panther is like the rage
of a doll's soul caught in the body: but
to say: under an open window, a violin

Accomplishment though is another matter--
Just ask Baudelaire and so I
          thought I could do it.

Necromancer, necromancer, necromancer
          make me a mate
only one of my ribs pray take.

So why won't women fit into that space?

                                       *

Is that why in the photograph David plays
an inflatable lyre? Does his smile make it all artifice?

                                       *

But life is this and it will not
be contained. The Igbo say:
No one can outrun their shadow.
And this is good. This is hope.
Because, or maybe, we cannot outrun love.

                                       *

To drive down a road, she said. Until it stops
at the edge of the sea. An ocean vast and immense,
she said. If you are lucky, she said. It fills you.






Blue
 

                                  I

Africans in the hold fold themselves
to make room for hope. In the afternoon's
ferocity, tar, grouting the planks like the glue
of family, melts to the run of a child's licorice stick.

Wet decks crack, testing the wood's mettle.
Distilled from evaporating brine, salt
dusts the floor, tickling with the measure
into time and the thirst trapped below.


                                  II

The captain's new cargo of Igbos disturbs him.
They stand, computing the swim back to land.
Haitians still say: Igbo pend'c or' a ya!
But we do not hang ourselves in cowardice.


                                  III

Sold six times on the journey to the coast,
once for a gun, then cloth, then iron
manilas, her pride was masticated like husks
of chewing sticks, spat from morning-rank mouths.

Breaking loose, edge of handcuffs held high
like the blade of a vengeful axe, she runs
across the salt scratch of deck,
pain deeper than the blue inside a flame.


                                  IV

The sound, like the break of bone
could have been the Captain's skull
or the musket shot dropping her
over the side, her chains wrapped 
around his neck in dance.






Chant:
 

It was the hornbill that spoke it.
In the nothing, becoming nothing,
begetting nothing; this is everything.

The world is old, the world is new

How does the darkness hide?
In the nothing, becoming nothing,
begetting nothing; this is everything.

The world is old, the world is new

The sun is no bigger than a crab.
In the nothing, becoming nothing,
begetting nothing; this is everything.

The world is old, the world is new

Hot soup is devoured from the edges.
In the nothing, becoming nothing,
begetting nothing; this is everything.

The world is old, the world is new

The blood sign is red; burning like fire.
In the nothing, becoming nothing,
begetting nothing; this is everything.

The world is old, the world is new

It has no name; silence is its name.
In the nothing, becoming nothing,
begetting nothing; this is everything.

The world is old, the world is new.






Parable of the Desultory Slut
 

          
          When he read in the obituary section that he was dead, the famous author was at first amused and flattered. They love me so much, he thought, they have imagined me dead because they fear the loss of my genius above all else. So he put on his hat, combed his goatee to a waxed point, and sauntered out of his flat to attend his own funeral. How literary, he thought, like Huck Finn, and Everyone will be weeping.       He was perturbed, however, when he found that the funeral home was in a bad section of town, next to a tattoo parlor named The Desultory Slut. He walked in past the unmanned front desk, to a back room of frayed velvet and gilt columns, where his coffin was on display, a faux mahogany monstrosity with painted pewter handles. The only people in attendance were four young professors from the local college, with leather patches on the elbows of their ill-fitting tweed jackets and long cruel faces of foxes and rats. He recognized one of them, a gangly fellow with pimply cheeks who had shaken his hand after his last reading and reverently asked for his signature.       Do you have one of my books to sign? the author had asked.       Oh no, the young professor had cried, baring his hairless chest, can you please sign here?       Now the pimply fellow was sitting in a pew, whispering loudly to his neighbor, Isn't it great, he said, The old bastard finally kicked.       His neighbor nodded silently.       Deeply disturbed, but well aware of the dramatic potential of the moment, the author took this as his cue to step boldly into the room, with a loud Ta daaa!       For some reason, the professors ignored him, and continued their whispering.       For a moment, he was afflicted with a strange vertigo, and stood like a clay golem, without a will of his own. Then a sudden rage took him, and the author snapped out of the spell and strode to the front of the room, waving his arms. Wait, I'm not dead at all. Here I am. It was all a mistake, he cried.       But the professors did not see him. In fact one walked right through him, as if he were merely a ghost or spirit, and rushed up to the coffin. Do you realize what this means? the professor cried, This means we're free, and he grabbed the body in the coffin and dragged it to the floor. The shocked author saw in the body his own likeness, lips and cheeks rouged into a grotesque semblance of life.       He's dead, he's dead. Our enemy is finally dead, they chanted in a frenzy and the professors began trampling on the corpse, weeping with joy and relief.
        




Parable in Praise of Violence
 

"Violence is as American as cherry pie.            --H. Rap Brown, former Black Panther justice minister
Thanks for the violence. Thanks for Walt's rude muscle
pushing through the grass, for tiny Gulliver crushed
between the giant's breasts. Thanks for Moby's triangular hump
and Ahab's castrated leg. Thanks for the harpoons.
Thanks for this PBS history of the automatic pistol.

The good machine is simple, few moving parts,
an efficiency of what's preserved and what is wasted,
so with each shot the recoil cocks the gun to shoot again,
then recoil, cock and shoot again, recoil, cock,
and so on till the target buys it, or your ammo's spent.

Thanks for the poem, which is really a little pistol:
load and cock, point and aim, then the trigger,
the hammer, the powder, the discharge, the bullet,
the target, the recoil, the crime. No smoking gun,
just ballistics, caliber, powder marks, the question why.

My life is like a loaded gun, and when I aim it at you
I hope to take off the top of your head,
no safety on, no playing nice, just the spark,
the flash, the damage, just red American
cherry pie violence. So, thank you

for the harpoon gun we aim at God and death
and all the unknown world, and for the spear-stuck beast,
rope ripping through torn hands, for what
refuses to be caught and what we fathom only by
riding the whale down into the deep, refusing to let go.






The 167th Psalm of Elvis
 

Blessed are the marble breasts of Venus,
those ancient miracles, for they are upright and milk white
and they point above the heads of the crowd in the casino.
Blessed are the crowds that play, and whose reflections
sway in the polish of her eggshell eyes,
for they circle like birds around the games,
and they are beautiful and helpless.
Bless the fast glances that handle the waitress,
bless her miniskirt toga and the flame-gold scotch,
and bless the gamblers who gaze at the stage.
Remember also the dancer and remember her dance,
her long neck arched like a wild white goose,
the tassels on her nipples that shoot like sparks,
and bless the legs and bless the breasts
for they are fruit and honey and they are generous to the eyes.
Have mercy on my wallet, the dollars I punch into the slot,
and grace the wheels swapping clubs and hearts.
Mercy on me too, as I stumble as if in a hashish haze
watching the reels spin away, for I am a blown fuse
and I need someone to bless me before it's too late.
Honor the chance in a million, the slot machine jolting,
the yellow light flashing, honor the voice that calls jackpot,
and the coins that crush into the brushed steel tray,
for there is a time for winning and a time for losing
and if you cast your bread upon the waters
you will find it again after many days.
Pity the crowd around the blessed winner
all patting his back as if it rubs off,
this juice, this force, this whatever
that might save them from their own cursed luck.
And pity the poor winner whose hand claws back
into his bucket of coins and who cannot walk away,
because he'd do anything for the feeling he had
when the great pattern rose from the chaos
of cherries and lemons and diamonds and stars
and he knew for that moment he was blessed.






Everyone Has a House
 

What I like about your country
she tells me is the toilets
I wouldn't mind bringing one home
but it wouldn't do much good
she says she likes the bathtubs
and the refrigerators
but she is not so crazy
about the tortillas
which are not made properly
or the cilantro which tastes like soap
Also the freeways ruin the landscape
and the children watch television
when they could be playing soccer
and the teenagers stare at their parents
with bare faces that say
give it to me
and the abuelitos are like dogs
to the children
the children walk by with no respect
mangoes here are not so good
not enough rain
and the women here have so many clothes
I think your country has the most wonderful bathrooms
and everyone has a house
although tents would be nicer
I think or boats
or even just sleeping in a tree
My family has a tree
we live under
but the tree has no toilet
I grant you that.






Tuesdays
 

Today is a Tuesday, one of many.
He has a girl he loves every Tuesday,
her day off. He burns
at the fine fire of her conscience,

tells her they'll be married
someday. He has a wife,
Doreen, a freckle-faced fat thing
who harbors resentment that during her Tuesday

at her mother's, he insists on going to the movies.
Rose petals he picks up in the neighbor's yard
end up at Tuesday's feet and
sprinkled through the sheets.

Of course they must make love,
since he sees her only once a week.
Doreen requires sex after seeing her mother.
He feels like an ox on Tuesday, powerful and massive.

He tells this to Tuesday
and to Doreen.
Doreen tells him he is an ox
a brute master of the air and his rightful bed.

But Tuesday, who knows oxen
are slow moving, dim witted,
and castrated at birth,
follows him home instead of playing her dulcimer,

climbs the wall, watches him mounting his wife,
leaves rose petals on his doorstep,
takes the train to cornfields, steers and heifers
watches the city disappear in rain.

Thinks briefly of how tenderly
he rose in her fingers
while the remains of their breakfast,
eggs and potatoes

cooled on the wooden table
with the tattered tablecloth.






Helping My Daughter Move into Her First Apartment
 

This is all I am to her now: 
a pair of legs in running shoes, 

two arms strung with braided wire. 
She heaves a carton sagging with CDs  

at me and I accept it gladly, lifting 
with my legs, not bending over, 
     
raising each foot high enough 
to clear the step. Fortunate to be  

of any use to her at all, 
I wrestle, stooped and single-handed,  

with her mattress in the stairwell, 
saying nothing as it pins me,  

sweating, to the wall. Vacuum cleaner, 
spiny cactus, five-pound sacks  

of rice and lentils slumped 
against my heart: up one flight  

of stairs and then another, 
down again with nothing in my arms.





The Emperors New Clothes
 

Gertrude Stein.
We could end there.
But we won't.
Because we want to make meaning.
Of something.
to say something.
Of value.
In order that.
It's absolutely.
The professor said.
Wiggling his ears.
In a satisfied way.
And the students all said, Amen.
That's the way with critical acclaim.
Absolutely.
There are rooms.
There are builders.
There is a clock.
There is a cake.
There is a rope.
There is a sounding to depths.
But when she dies, what then?
Who knew what it all meant?
And when all the modernists are dead?
The critics will babble and frenzy
forever to find the nouns she never wrote
between the crowded verbs and adverbs.






The Way I Learned to Write
 

There were words I had to leave behind,
moonlight, backward ponies.
Leaving flowers out seemed safest.
Trying for something surreal,
A trouble free rise of smoke and lavender.

No not lavender. Any shade
of purple is best left alone.
Perhaps a jaundiced smoke
rising in my poetry
would be best, although I like violet haze.

Many a summer morning,
while other folks are
eating bagels, lox,
cinnamon rolls,
I rummage through old cider houses,

find words like obdurate,
bipolar, manic, cold heeled.
But writing about love, well,
not even searches to junkyards
as far away as Peking

turn up the slightest unused vowel.
So, I make words up, create my own language.
You Chinese me in the roofy mornings.
You Japanese my legs in the spidery evenings.
Our children are the leggy offspring

of centipede afternoons. Our bedroom
is the Acropolis. You temple me backward.
I could bless you all the way to shadowland.
If we were not already steepled there,
our undergarments ruffianed off onto chairs.

You catapulted silence,
dogkissed, catlicked my paws
held my squeaks and rattles.
Where the rest had said, What's this?
You said, it's mine.






The Common Women Poems, II. Ella, in a square apron, along Highway 80
 

She's a copperheaded waitress,
tired and sharp-worded, she hides
her bad brown tooth behind a wicked
smile, and flicks her ass
out of habit, to fend off the pass
that passes for affection.
She keeps her mind the way men
keep a knife--keen to strip the game
down to her size. She has a thin spine,
swallows her eggs cold, and tells lies.
She slaps a wet rag at the truck drivers
if they should complain. She understands
the necessity for pain, turns away
the smaller tips, out of pride, and
keeps a flask under the counter. Once,
she shot a lover who misused her child.
Before she got out of jail, the courts had pounced
and given the child away. Like some isolated lake,
her flat blue eyes take care of their own stark
bottoms. Her hands are nervous, curled, ready
to scrape.
The common woman is as common
as a rattlesnake.






The Common Women Poems, III. Nadine, resting on her neighbors stoop
 

She holds things together, collects bail,
makes the landlord patch the largest holes.
At the Sunday social she would spike
every drink, and offer you half of what she knows,
which is plenty. She pokes at the ruins of the city
like an armored tank; but she thinks
of herself as a ripsaw cutting through
knots in wood. Her sentences come out
like thick pine shanks
and her big hands fill the air like smoke.
She's a mud-chinked cabin in the slums,
sitting on the doorstep counting
rats and raising 15 children,
half of them her own. The neighborhood
would burn itself out without her;
one of these days she'll strike the spark herself.
She's made of grease
and metal, with a hard head
that makes the men around her seem frail.
The common woman is as common as

Sheep
 

The first four leaders had broken knees
The four old dams had broken knees
The flock would start to run, then freeze
The first four leaders had broken knees

Why is the flock so docile?' asked the hawk.
Yes, why is the flock so docile,' laughed the dog,

The shepherd's mallet is in his hand,
The shepherd's hand is on the land,
The flock will start to run, then freeze--
The four old dams have broken knees,'
The dog explained.

The hawk exclaimed:
The shepherd leads an easy life!'

I know, I know,' cried the shepherd's wife,
He dresses me out in a narrow skirt
and leaves me home to clean his dirt.
Whenever I try to run, I freeze--
All the old dams have broken knees.'

Well, I'm so glad he doesn't dare
to bring his breaking power to bear
on me,' said the hawk, flying into the sun;
while the dog warned, in his dog run:
Hawk--the shepherd has bought a gun!'

Why is the hawk so docile?' asked the flock,

He fell to the ground in a feathery breeze;
He lies in a dumb lump under the trees,
We believe we'd rather have broken knees
Than lose our blood and suddenly freeze
Like him.'

But the oldest dam gave her leg a lick,
And said, Some die slow and some die quick,
A few run away and the rest crawl,
But the shepherd never dies at all--
Damn his soul.

I'd will my wool to the shepherd's wife
If she could change the shepherd's life,
But I myself would bring him low
If only, only I knew how.'






Slowly: a plainsong from an older woman to a younger woman
 

am I not    olden olden olden
it is unwanted.

wanting, wanting
am I not    broken
stolen    common

am I not crinkled cranky poison
am I not glinty-eyed and frozen

am I not    aged
shaky    glazing
am I not    hazy
guarded    craven

am I not    only
stingy    little
am I not    simple
brittle    spitting

was I not    over
over    ridden?

it is a long story
will you be proud to be my version?

it is unwritten.

writing, writing
am I not    ancient
raging    patient

am I not    able
charming    stable
was I not    building

was I not    ruling

was I not    brazen
crazy    chosen

even the stones would do my bidding?

it is a long story
am I not proud to be your version?

it is unspoken.

Paris and Helen
 

He called her:  golden dawn
She called him:  the wind whistles

He called her:  heart of the sky
She called him:  message bringer

He called her:  mother of pearl
           barley woman, rice provider,
           millet basket, corn maid,
           flax princess, all-maker, weef

She called him:  fawn, roebuck,
           stag, courage, thunderman,
           all-in-green, mountain strider
           keeper of forests, my-love-rides

He called her:  the tree is
She called him:  bird dancing

He called her:  who stands,
           has stood, will always stand
She called him:  arriver

He called her:  the heart and the womb
           are similar
She called him:  arrow in my heart.






Wind In Mytilene
 

and on the waves in turmoil
in the harbor
gulls floated
like pieces of paper
set adrift, little
boat-like birds
twirling
in the wind-tossed waves
that drove into
the strong arms of the seawall
at the apex of the bay
where a statue of Sappho stands,
young woman
with a lyre--not
looking out to sea
but glancing at the curve
of the seawall
and the birds,
those lost notes
before rain






The Lyric In A Time of War
 

for Sappho
Let my music be found wanting
in comparison
to yours (as it must)

let me be found loving
(as you were)
extravagantly the beautiful

let me find you
and the song (forever)
between us

in these terrible times






Changing What We Mean
 

Turning your back, you button your blouse. That's new.
You redirect the conversation. A man
has entered it. Your therapist has given you
permission to discuss this with me, the word
you've been looking for in desire.
You can now say "heterosexual with me. We mean

different things when we say it. I mean
the life I left behind forever. For you, it's a new
beginning, a stab at being normal again, a desire
to enter the world with a man
instead of a woman, and of course, there's the word
you won't claim for yourself anymore, you

who have children to think of, you
who have put me in line behind them and mean
to keep the order clear. It's really my word
against yours anymore in this new
language, in this battle over how a man
is about to enter this closed room of desire

we've gingerly exchanged keys to, but desire
isn't what's at issue anyway, you
say to me. Instead I learn a man
can protect you in a way a woman only means
to but never can, and my world is too new
when there's real life out there, word

after word for how normal looks, each word
cutting like scissors a profile of desire--
a man facing a woman, nothing particularly new
or interesting to me. I've wanted only to face you
and the world simultaneously, say what I mean
with my body, my choice to not be a man,

to be a woman with you, forget the man's
part or how his body is the word
for what touch can contain, what love means.
If this were only about desire,
you say, I'd still desire you.
But it isn't passion we're defining, new

consequences emerge when a man and desire
are part of the words we hurl, you
changing how you mean loving--this terrible final news.






The Beach at Sunset
 

for Colleen
The cliff above where we stand is crumbling
and up on the Palisades
the sidewalks buckle like a broken conveyer belt.

Art Deco palm trees sway their hula skirts
in perfect unison
against a backdrop of gorgeous blue,

and for you I would try it,
though I have always forbidden myself to write
poems about the beach at sunset.

All the clichs for it sputter
like the first generation of neon,
and what attracts me anyway

are these four species of gulls we've identified,
their bodies turned into the wind,
and not one of them aware of their silly beauty.

I'm the one awash in pastels
and hoping to salvage the day, finally turning away
from the last light on the western shore

and the steady whoosh of waves driving in,
drumming insistently like the undeniable data
of the cancer in your breast.

We walk back to the car
and take the top down for the ride home
through the early mist.

No matter what else is happening,
this is California. You'll have your cancer
at freeway speeds. I'll drive and park

and drive at park. The hospital
when I arrive to visit will be catching
the last rays of the sun, glinting

like an architectural miracle realized.
I realize a miracle is what you need--
a grain of sand, a perfect world

where you live beyond the facts
of what your body has given you
as the first taste of death.






Living Here Now
 

My father's dying
resembles nothing so much
as a small village
building itself
in the mind of a traveler
who reads about it
and thinks to go there.

The journey is imagined
in a way not even felt
as when years ago
I knew my father would die someday.

The idea came up as fast
as a curve in a road
which opens out
to an unexpected vista,

and now in this journey
the road gravel crunches
under my tires. I miss
some of the streets,
get lost, get lost.

I find I'm no tourist anymore
and settle into the oldest human assignment.
Bury your father and live forever
as a stranger in that town.






Asking About You
 

          
          Instead of having sex all the time I like to hold you and not get into some involved discussion of what life means. I want you to tell me something I don't know about you. Something about the day before that photograph in which you're standing on your head. I want to know about softball and the team picture. Why are you so little next to the others? Were you younger? Were you small as a girl? What I want most is to have been a girl with you and played on the opposite team so I could have liked you and competed against you at the same time.
        




In Your Face
 

Eyes that spurn yet invite
Like spikes in the sunlight
Of Manhattan's high-rise--
Babylon's ladies outshine
Daughters of Jerusalem,
Zion is no easy climb





Here Now
 

Now and again
I am here now
And now is when
I'm here again





Tempus fugit
 

For John Thornton
Fellow fugitive
Forgive yourself
And me thereby
Thus we can live
Whatever's left
Of time for us,
Each day a gift
We take on trust





Anniversary
 

You are for me as you cannot be
For yourself, chaos without demand
To speak, the amethyst nothing
Hidden inside the trinket shop's stone,
Dark eyes dark asterisks where light
Footnotes a margin left blank. You
Don't look up to look up at the sky. 
Your ears parenthesize nothing
That occurs, that I keep from occurring,
In the poem, on the page, as you are
For me, not a shadow, but a shade
Whose darkness drops from no object
But is itself yourself, a form of time
Spanning nothing, never is your name. 





Museums
 

Must I, in this question I am asking, include myself
Asking it? Must I include my face--
My face that I cannot see--through which I speak
This question about my eyes, about the field
Of vision, in which my hands press down these letters
Unattached to my arms? The sunlight
Comes in the window and lights up my hands
As they work. The world is not being kind
But there is the sensation of kindness. 
There is an appeal to a rule when we realize a term
Behaves uncomfortably. God falls down 
Into grammar and says I am but the words are spoken
From a bush on fire. God is included in this grammar 
Philosophy offers to the fly stuck in the bottle--
There it is on the table, walking in circles within the empty
Bottle, pausing only to rub its forelegs together,
In anticipation or prayer. I remember
Walking into the glass-walled museum and seeing myself 
Reflected in the head and in the belly of the metal rabbit's
Mirror-like skin. This was not long ago, this experience
Of the ancient world, reason simultaneous with appetite,
Watching myself think, seeing my eyes thinking,
My body a body that contained this thinking 
That I write in the margins of the books I read, a script
That over time appears less legible, a form 
Of cuneiform I cannot read myself what I wrote 
In the margins. There is a fragment that floats in the air
Floating in my mind, spoken by a voice not mine:
To study circumcises the heart and calms,
The book steadies the heart [many words are missing
Or illegible] if not, to turn away,
Fire courses through the veins [many words are
Missing or illegible] then
Anger, anger. Leaning back in the tall grass,
Putting my book aside, my toe covers the sun.
I am imagining this world but I'm inviting you in
So I can join you. In the old language, the language
No one ever spoke, the language whose words
In the scholarly papers are marked by stars,
Asterisks that say this word exists by not existing,
The imaginary root pushing down from the sky
Into our heads, the root of the tongue;
In this language "I meant "here, it did not mean "me,
It meant a location in which this body I am
Was not an expression of love but a word of
Presence. Here I am. Voice in a boundary.
In this place I am I once had a dream. 
Cylindrical seals rolled across the earth 
Printing in the mud the image of a woman braiding 
Her hair was loose and then her hair was bound.
These roads end at the horizon where I also end,
Present in this world as the alphabet is present
In this poem. *I. *I. Sometimes *I like to stutter.
*I like to think the sky is blue. *I see sometimes it's red.
More soon on the nature of impossible constructions.  
The man in the moon. The sea rose. The living room. 





Psalm
 

Let's make believe
I am happy, I laugh
Black poison, all of me
Its bottleful,
Become sparkling water
My cup runneth over
I am your son
You are my daughter,
The only one





"Four Quartets Revisited
 

On opening a long unopened book,
what odor rises from the parting pages,
what genie is released, what dark spell broken,
as if some spirit trapped inside for ages,

By this hinge swung open were set free?
My father's hand has jotted in the margins
its own blunt text of what must be
lecture notes, and planted his place marker

Like a flag among "The Dry Salvages--
a UC "schedule card, a blank
grid for weekly classes, and on the back,
O fees and late fees time alone assuages--

We know the longhand's labored look
was mine, but why that child should scrawl
a phrase so apt for now's beyond recall:
on opening a long unopened book.





Cast Off
 

If thy own hand . . . offend thee      --Matthew 18:8
Self-hatred? No, no dear: that seems inflated--
chagrin: the shame you feel when friends withdraw
for reasons they leave tactfully unstated,
leaving you to guess at your faux pas

From all you did and didn't say for ages,
as in some vast congressional report,
your sin, at last, is lost among the pages;
a snow of detail cuts inquiry short.

In downtown windows where late sunlight glares,
you see yourself, as if you'd never met.
Who is this rumpled lookalike who wears
a blouse like yours, the armpits dark with sweat?

Your eighth grade diary still makes you cringe
saved--for what?--that you might now despise
pages time has lent a jaundiced tinge
pouring forth their daisy-dotted i's?

Some second-guesser in you finds untrue
the echo of your own voice in your ears,
and wants to ask which one most sickens you:
the voice that whines with neediness and fears,

Or one no doubts can ever undermine,
that speaks before a general assembly,
proclaiming loudly what to do with thine
own hand (or his, or mine), should it offend thee?





Why do you stay up so late?
 

For Russ
I'll tell you, if you really want to know:
remember that day you lost two years ago
at the rockpool where you sat and played the jeweler
with all those stones you'd stolen from the shore?
Most of them went dark and nothing more,
but sometimes one would blink the secret color
it had locked up somewhere in its stony sleep.
This is how you knew the ones to keep.

So I collect the dull things of the day
in which I see some possibility
but which are dead and which have the surprise
I don't know, and I've no pool to help me tell--
so I look at them and look at them until
one thing makes a mirror in my eyes
then I paint it with the tear to make it bright.
This is why I sit up through the night.





The Lie
 

As was my custom, I'd risen a full hour 
before the house had woken to make sure
that everything was in order with The Lie,
his drip changed and his shackles all secure.

I was by then so practiced in this chore
I'd counted maybe thirteen years or more
since last I'd felt the urge to meet his eye.
Such, I liked to think, was our rapport.

I was at full stretch to test some ligature
when I must have caught a ragged thread, and tore 
his gag away; though as he made no cry,
I kept on with my checking as before.

Why do you call me The Lie? he said. I swore:
it was a child's voice. I looked up from the floor.
The dark had turned his eyes to milk and sky
and his arms and legs were all one scarlet sore.

He was a boy of maybe three or four.
His straps and chains were all the things he wore.
Knowing I could make him no reply
I took the gag before he could say more

and put it back as tight as it would tie 
and locked the door and locked the door and locked the door





Semblance: Screens
 

A moth lies open and lies
like an old bleached beech leaf,
a lean-to between window frame and sill. 
Its death protects a collection of tinier deaths 
and other dirts beneath.
Although the white paint is water-stained, 
on it death is dirt, and hapless.

The just-severed tiger lily 
is drinking its glass of water, I hope.
This hope is sere.
This hope is severe.
What you ruin ruins you, too
and so you hope for favor.
I mean I do.

The underside of a ladybug 
wanders the window. I wander
the continent, my undercarriage not as evident,
so go more perilously, it seems to me.
But I am only me; to you it seems clear
I mean to disappear, and am mean
and project on you some ancient fear.

If I were a bug, I hope I wouldn't be
this giant winged thing, spindly like a crane fly,
skinny-legged like me, kissing the cold ceiling, 
fumbling for the face of the other, seeking.
It came in with me last night when I turned on the light.

I lay awake, afraid it would touch my face.

It wants out. I want out, too.
I thought you a way through.
Arms wide for wings, 
your suffering mine, twinned.
Screen. Your unbelief drives me in,
doubt for dirt, white sheet for sill--
You don't stay other enough or still
enough to be likened to.








O
 

What was it for the longest time but lore, lure;

A heard-tell growing gold in the mind.

Word said (and word'd spread) it was well on back

Through the underwood by Bowen's Canal.

Past convoluted trees there's claydirt, a clear patch.

A (rife) clearing.

Ripe croodle-field.

Ring. 


        


Bear off

Right where understory comes to grief entire--

Grubble this way head-down

Belly-down claw through clingburrs as a creature.

Cross (fret-morass and canebrake) and pass.



     



Encompassed here

Where springs not fail

Canes not break nor welt on backs of leg

Green cresses plait

No plaque of heated iron scathes

(Nor noose, nor knives)

Articulated scapes arise



     



Always the story-man lights lard-lamps in a circle and tells.

A boy scrapes and ever-graves for likeness with a stick.

Two girls croodle corn-songs cane-songs back and forth unbroken.

Once-bent bodies leap (in chorus) leg and whirl.






The Second Slaughter
 

Achilles slays the man who slayed his friend, pierces the corpse
behind the heels and drags it
behind his chariot like the cans that trail
a bride and groom. Then he lays out
a banquet for his men, oxen and goats
and pigs and sheep; the soldiers eat
until a greasy moonbeam lights their beards.

The first slaughter is for victory, but the second slaughter is for grief--
in the morning more animals must be killed
for burning with the body of the friend. But Achilles finds
no consolation in the hiss and crackle of their fat;
not even heaving four stallions on the pyre
can lift the ballast of his sorrow.

And here I turn my back on the epic hero--the one who slits
the throats of his friend's dogs,
killing what the loved one loved
to reverse the polarity of grief. Let him repent
by vanishing from my concern
after he throws the dogs onto the fire.
The singed fur makes the air too difficult to breathe.

When the oil wells of Persia burned I did not weep
until I heard about the birds, the long-legged ones especially
which I imagined to be scarlet, with crests like egrets
and tails like peacocks, covered in tar
weighting the feathers they dragged through black shallows 
at the rim of the marsh. But once

I told this to a man who said I was inhuman, for giving animals
my first lament. So now I guard 
my inhumanity like the jackal
who appears behind the army base at dusk,
come there for scraps with his head lowered
in a posture that looks like appeasement,
though it is not.





Swerve
 

I think of the man who sat
behind my grandmother's sister
in church and told her
the percentage of Indian 
in her blood, calling it out
over the white pews.
I wonder what made
him want to count it 
like coins or a grade.
I wish I could hear him
now when I think of her
saying that all 
the Wampanoag blood
in her body would
fit in one finger,
discounting the percentage
it seemed, but why was she 
such a historian, tracing
the genealogy of the last
Wampanoag up to her own
children, typing it all on see-through
paper? Maybe like me
she felt a little self-conscious
caring about what
we're made of 
instead of simply being
satisfied dressing
our bodies and driving
them around. 
Maybe she felt shy
for loving someone
she'd never met, I mean
I do. I think of the knife 
cutting into flesh 
and the fork carrying it 
to your mouth. 
I always think
of that, the scythe-
like movement,
single motion, a swerve.
I think of my relative, the last 
Wampanoag in the town, 
walking the streets 
with a dollar 
the town gave him. 
Even then what would 
a dollar buy, a finger 
of land? If an Indian 
could have bought land.
I think of walking
into the almshouse. The alms 
falling like figs from trees, 
something to gnaw on. 
I think of the first time 
of thanks
before it had a name, 
when it was just some 
relatives of mine keeping 
some relatives of yours 
alive through a cold winter, 
people stupid enough 
to take food from a graveyard, 
food meant for the dead. 





Abstracts
 

                                            RED
The skim on the surface of your soup, or the cut on your plate
in the Caf des Anges, juices swamping the willow-pattern skiff
as she dabs her mouth with her napkin, your blind, blind date,

leaving a smudge, lipstick-and-gore, though there's still a worm
of gristle in the gap between her teeth.
Mood music, candlelight, wine, low voices in a world of harm,
   
the creature brought down, hindquarters heavy, hind legs
broken by the dogs, its head held up, eyes wide,
the tangle and drag as a gralloch knife unpegs

the bulk, all slippage and seepage, and the way she thumbs
a morsel into your mouth, or smiles your smile
back at you, lets you know that everything's just as it seems,

then back at the small hotel, she strips off quicker than you
might have hoped, pink as a new-skinned cat, all too 
eager to have you by heart. Her cry tells you nothing new.
 

                                            PURPLE
Surely, what first comes to mind is purpill and pall.
No? So is it what she is said to have said that night
when she breathed a secret and put the whole room on stall?

Not that? Then it must have something to do with the way,
in the fairy tale when the twins are lost in the wood,
daylight suddenly deepens and it's run or stay or pray.

Still wrong? Rain in the hanging gardens then? That bruise
you can't account for? The color of money, win or lose?
A Balkan liqueur that hits you where--Ah, yes, of course; the bruise.
 

                                            BLACK
You know the room, or think you do, half-dark
and windowless it seems, though maybe
the shutters are dropped against the day, loose talk

from women in veils and something like a pulse,
on the air when he opens the door and slips straight in.
The Loden coat, the old slouch hat, the harelip, so who else

could it be, right on time and keen to help? Think back
to those promises, all of them straight from the heart,
never asked for, never kept. The skin trade . . . there's a knack.

It's been a lifetime coming but now you understand,
or think you do, why what you wanted wasn't what you planned.
They bring a tray to your bedside. You eat from his hand.
 

                                            BLUE
It sings they say, and so it does: something like the note
that fractures glass or gets so far below 
the range of human hearing that it jolts your heart;

and the glass it breaks is blue, and that's a blue note for sure
from the guy on the alto sax in the basement dive,
which is where they're bound to meet up in the classic noir,

the private eye, the girl with a shadowy past, the old-style cop,
and it's nigh-on certain she'll have to take a bullet
or we'll see her in prison blue as they lead her to the drop.

The fragments of glass were part of it too, that's plain,
though no one noticed, just as they failed to spot
how the crucifix in her bedroom made sense of the subtle stain 

on her cocktail dress. And in this, the director's cut,
the dive is deeper, the saxophone sadder, the cop
bent as a dog's hind leg, the girl a scheming slut,

and the gumshoe comes in late with the one and only clue
that would finally set things straight, though its true
meaning is hidden from him, and lost on you.
 

                                            GREEN
That misericord with the ugly little fucker
at the moment in his dance when slap-and-tickle
has become a serious matter, and no one's quicker

in getting his hand up the skirt of some "ladye fayre,
who returns to hearth and home with the rub of the green
on her back for all to see and devil-may-care,

his smell still on her, reek of the barley mow,
and hers on him, which could have been sloe
or sweat and sandalwood, but you'd be the one to know. 





To the Quarry and Back
 

White hail pelting the frozen bog,
I'm stuck in the first line of January,
following my host's dog
on his walk through the stone century,
around the quarry, slices of marble and mud,
past a herd of miners exhaling smoke,
past a barn smelling of merde,
and back to where I'm stuck and broke.
The fucking dog barks at the night,
mad at the stars all his life and then again.
I rethink kicking him out,
but being cool, I let him in.






Drifting at Midday
 

Now I can see: even the trees 
are tired: they are bones bent forward 

in a skin of wind, leaning in 
osteoporosis, reaching 

for a little more than any 
oxygen can give: when living 

is in season, they can live; 
but living is no reason 

to continue: everything begins: 
and everything is desperate 

to extend: and everything is 
insufficient in the end: 

and everything is ending: 
Now I can see: even the trees





Insomnia & So On
 

Fat bed, lick the black cat in my mouth 
each morning. Unfasten all the bones 

that make a head, and let me rest: unknown 
among the oboe-throated geese gone south 

to drop their down and sleep beside the out- 
bound tides. Now there's no nighttime I can own 

that isn't anxious as a phone 
about to ring. Give me some doubt 

on loan; give me a way to get away 
from what I know. I pace until the sun 

is in my window. I lie down. I'm a coal: 
I smolder to a bloodshot glow. Each day 

I die down in my bed of snow, undone 
by my red mind and what it woke. 





Formulary
 

We are dropping one and gaining two--.
The things I cannot do

include to sleep,
to calm the spillway of the blood,

to face an auditorium,
wishing it were churchy pillbox hats--

recital mothers'--
with no sense of Vogue or the Baroque.

I've other pills
to tramp on grief, 

estrange pain,
and hatch the part of waking that is dreams,

double one dose to un-depress
and to write less and less

a chronicle of anxiety.

I spot-treat
a spate of addiction

in this faint dusk world 
of peach sky and plum leaflets--

a woman in her prime,
pilled together.





The Order In Which Things Are Broken
 

Ancients threw the masks down the cenote--
the faces smashed first in little ways before 
the long drop, an eye or an ear broken, a mouth snapped 
in half. Then, lifted from the well, two thousand years 
later, still grinning and golden. The loose spooling of two 
people fast unravels--how we let go of time spent, 
how heat fades, how a body forgets fully what it knew. 
I have learned your face as you will never.
The third day we met you gave me all your secrets 
until I held an ocean in a cradle. Now all I ask for is more.





Half-Ourselves & Half-Not
 

If you sleep the night inside someone, her cells,
saltwater-stained, fuse with yours like the blood of twins. 

Apes in Mauritania grow stronger, Galileo tells us, 
influenced by the sphere of angels. 

Here, then--thumbnail sketches 
for zoning changes along the riparian bank

of the species boundary, for a chimera. 
Like fiber optics, human nerves

lay along glassy bone & spinal veins of a fetal mouse
that will be drowned before ever waking. 

A hen's brain replaces a quail's--nodding, cooing, 
not understanding the change. Less human, less nature. 

Less solace in these songs half-ourselves
& half-not. Did I wake you, my singing? 

Here, the sphere of angels & here the sphere of sea. 
Darwin, writing in his garden, remembers the sea

like some sleep he feared he'd never wake from. 
If all men were dead then monkeys make men, 

he noted for himself, &, almost as an aside--Men makes angels. 
If my nerves were fed to an osprey, a finch,

could she still take wing? Rain 
behind the bedroom blinds, I will wake, won't I, 

to your cells replacing mine, this cape lionness
liver, aorta of a garter snake, &, from a goat twisted 

with an orb spider, milk boiled down to silk, gossamer
the structure of Bethlehem steel?





At Thomas Mertons Grave
 

We can never be with loss too long.
Behind the warped door that sticks,
the wood thrush calls to the monks,
pausing upon the stone crucifix,
singing: "I am marvelous alone!
Thrash, thrash goes the hayfield:
rows of marrow and bone undone.
The horizon's flashing fastens tight,
sealing the blue hills with vermilion.
Moss dyes a squirrel's skull green.
The cemetery expands its borders--
little milky crosses grow like teeth.
How kind time is, altering space
so nothing stays wrong; and light,
more new light, always arrives.





A Message from the Wanderer
 

Today outside your prison I stand
and rattle my walking stick: Prisoners, listen;
you have relatives outside. And there are
thousands of ways to escape.

Years ago I bent my skill to keep my
cell locked, had chains smuggled to me in pies,
and shouted my plans to jailers;
but always new plans occured to me,
or the new heavy locks bent hinges off,
or some stupid jailer would forget
and leave the keys.

Inside, I dreamed of constellations--
those feeding creatures outlined by stars,
their skeletons a darkness between jewels,
heroes that exist only where they are not.

Thus freedom always came nibbling my thought,
just as--often, in light, on the open hills--
you can pass an antelope and not know
and look back, and then--even before you see--
there is something wrong about the grass.
And then you see.

That's the way everything in the world is waiting.

Now--these few more words, and then I'm
gone: Tell everyone just to remember
their names, and remind others, later, when we 
find each other. Tell the little ones
to cry and then go to sleep, curled up
where they can. And if any of us get lost,
if any of us cannot come all the way--
remember: there will come a time when
all we have said and all we have hoped
will be all right.

There will be that form in the grass.





At the Un-National Monument along the Canadian Border
 

This is the field where the battle did not happen,
where the unknown soldier did not die.
This is the field where grass joined hands,
where no monument stands,
and the only heroic thing is the sky.

Birds fly here without any sound,
unfolding their wings across the open.
No people killed--or were killed--on this ground
hallowed by neglect and an air so tame
that people celebrate it by forgetting its name.





[Record no oiled tongue, diary]
 

Record no oiled tongue, diary--
Note my lantern bruises the low
Clouds with light the evening
We talked. Almonds in a bowl;
She ate none. I did
Not bid her remove her dark
Gloves as sometime before she had done.
Her dress not so clean as before.
A last brand not rescued to flame--
No billow but breath, and breath
Too short a line to twine
Our hands in marriage: I left
A last time. Her in widow's silk--
My lantern clothed in morning
Dawns on this road so late tonight
The white birches I believe,
I believe I could have loved
Her, her white wrists
White the birch trees by lantern bared,
Black gloves pulled off at night
Become the night . . . . Do you hear?
That pulse? The deer wander
Between her hands, glean fallen 
Seed at hand, bed down in fallen
Needles and grass. Those green discs
Afloat in the night are their eyes
Caught in lantern light. Can it be
So many wake the forest glows
With sight? See and am seen. A pulse
At the stump is breath and rest
And breath again. Infinite
In store the game of this land.
Note the plumage of the turkey.
Note the thick meat at breast.
Sap: syrup. Pine: plank. A copse
Of wood is cord for furnace. A copse
Is cottage, too. The owl in the hollow
Tree screeches because I am too close
To truth. Note the almond
Tree overmuch with fruit. The almond
Pressed is oil sweet. The almond bit
Is a smoky meat that leaves--note it:
The tongue bathed in oil.





[Posterity, this me is Now]
 

Posterity, this me is Now--
Record this Now. Virginia, 1705
Not always settled. I am settled
Over history's yellow pages, blank
Pages, must I write my old dark
Thoughts: Does time mask or unmask
Mind? This sweet almond now
In my mouth as in their mouths
Then, sweet in its rind, but silent
I think: I am blood at oak, my hand
A blood petal unfurled over oak,
My desk, my wooded den, a pistil,
A pen. Believe me: I speak honest 
And true.

First.

Economy ravishing and jealous
In woods, the virgin woods.
Sap is sweet so sap quarrels
On the tongue. What is worth
Worth? Sap sweet so sap ambers;
In the virgin woods none can cut
The profit from the tongue. Amber
Gold so gold whispers at the edge
Of each, our minds. The Natives
Wear skins on skin; the women
Bare their breasts and do not
Blush. Was she a King's daughter?
She walked below the branches;
The sun thin in silken lines
The sated spiders left. Her brothers
Showed us what seeds to sow.
Glass beads contain light, a miracle
To trade. Her skin a syrup
Tone, the beads gold against her
Wrist glowed. Midnight her crown
Of hair plaited with one strand
Of gold, thin as day's edge when dusk
Both dulls and hones that glow.
"We'll barter it. Her brother feels
Cheated when we offer a bolt
Less of wool than he asks. Write it
Down. Profit in black ink. They close
Their eyes, quick as bark blinks
Down dark on axe's silver bite,
When the deal is done. The ledger's 
Honest, "I am a liar. Be aware.

Then.

Pluck the withered gold at hand,
The pumpkin leaves yellow,
Sere and dust. Neglect the acre.
Let the green aphids multiply
And suck. We teethed our vision:
A yellow sort of isinglass dust,
Sunlit in silt, under the water
Of our stream. The squash blossom
Closed its eye; we squinted to see
Beneath the stream. That summer
We fed our hearts on dust. We grew
Dust in gardens. We grew rich
Until the gold sheen disclosed
It was but gilded dust. We lived
Some time on mussel, crab, berry,
Those fruits of the wild earth. No one
Spoke the word "starving. We were
Forced to be content with what fell
Just in our mouths.

Earlier Than First.

Thought in the forest speaks
A wooden chorus. My own voice
Multiplied the almond by the pine.
Roanoke, 1588. Repaired the houses
Now grown up with weeds.
We make wooden houses. How quiet
One voice, mumbling verses out
The wilderness, by the fire
In the corner. Bibles clothed in skin
As the Natives come clothed. Exodus
A comfort: to be chosen, safe,
God spoke in smoke by day, in light
By night. A manna faith--of manna.

When Mr. White arrived, late August
1590, he went to search for us. Found
Weeds grown among the wood
Homes. He found us removed
From this land. He heard us whisper.
He never heard from us again.
Notes we pinned to the trees told him
We moved to another
Island that forms the sound
(But we were not there).

We live in the sound. He found
Our voices pinned to the trees.

morning green through ivy

the birds their blood in arrows

the oak desk I think at the dark
cherry night
stand for your closed book
by the bed we keep a light to turn off
do you hear our whole house
swaying in the wind those birds
are not crying out in fear
those birds are singing nuptials
outside our house already built
in the green canopy the quoin of air


illumined always as it illumines
let us be truer
fact asleep below love a-leap // no
cornerstone no
cement save song do you
hear above us the river strong
in leaves the rubble
wind flows over and is not wind
river the rubblesource the river
ripples over to sing


us and the silken nest
weighs the beech branch down
in horror the multi
tude breathing in a single
lung and one


cocoon countless in turns
the transparent ever
winging itself past hunger
glows as we 
glow is woven of one single
thread and no


love thinks separate
the weaver from the wing


I say now I love you
with the worm in my mouth
spinning my words
into your ear and your listening
volumes pupa
in the elm's crotch and oak knot
do you hear as I hear
the old sins blossom from diaries
and become the faith leaves

Crying in Front of a Man
 

To my first love, I wept profusely.
These tears confused the boy, and he would act.
Generally, he took me out to eat.
I grew fat, sobbing my way into some of the best
restaurants in Richmond.

My first husband ignored the initial shattering of tears.
But if I went on grovelling, wailing long enough
he'd collect me from the floor
give me a bit more grocery money, wipe my eyes
tell me it would be okay by and by.

My second husband despised my tears.
He'd seen women crawl and shake enough,
said the vipers can enter a trance at will
and let their best sobs heave ho to twist a man
and bend him into shape.

I trouble not this third man with my tears.
Have in fact forgotten how to cry
and in forgetting have grown steel eyes,
a molten core like mad Vesuvius, am held in check
by nothing but the weather and the whims of fate.





Sphere
 

You can't imagine the goats
who were my only friends as a child
how they tore at my underwear,
hitting their heads into my legs,
playfully throwing me into the air.
How their snores rattled the night.
How their milk tasted sweet
and thick and altogether wild.
How they followed me through the orchard
and up into the rocky fields above
and ate blueberries through the afternoon.
How at twilight I'd walk down,
a hand on two goats' backs
and they'd talk me all the way down.
How many times I was beaten
about the face and shoulders and back.
How the goat smell kept me
from properly experiencing food.
How I crept out to the goats in the night
and slept very well there
the goats licking my bruises as though I
were sacred and wounded and divine.





Considering the Snail
 

The snail pushes through a green
night, for the grass is heavy
with water and meets over
the bright path he makes, where rain
has darkened the earth's dark. He
moves in a wood of desire,

pale antlers barely stirring
as he hunts. I cannot tell
what power is at work, drenched there
with purpose, knowing nothing.
What is a snail's fury? All
I think is that if later

I parted the blades above
the tunnel and saw the thin
trail of broken white across
litter, I would never have
imagined the slow passion
to that deliberate progress.





Moly
 

Nightmare of beasthood, snorting, how to wake.
I woke. What beasthood skin she made me take?

Leathery toad that ruts for days on end,
Or cringing dribbling dog, man's servile friend,

Or cat that prettily pounces on its meat,
Tortures it hours, then does not care to eat:

Parrot, moth, shark, wolf, crocodile, ass, flea.
What germs, what jostling mobs there were in me.

    These seem like bristles, and the hide is tough.
No claw or web here: each foot ends in hoof.

Into what bulk has method disappeared?
Like ham, streaked. I am gross--grey, gross, flap-eared.

The pale-lashed eyes my only human feature.
My teeth tear, tear. I am the snouted creature

That bites through anything, root, wire, or can.
If I was not afraid I'd eat a man.

Oh a man's flesh already is in mine.
Hand and foot poised for risk. Buried in swine.

    I root and root, you think that it is greed,
It is, but I seek out a plant I need.

Direct me gods, whose changes are all holy,
To where it flickers deep in grass, the moly:

Cool flesh of magic in each leaf and shoot,
From milky flower to the black forked root.

From this fat dungeon I could rise to skin
And human title, putting pig within.

I push my big grey wet snout through the green,
Dreaming the flower I have never seen.





enuresis
 

Terror is not  Ed 
sitting in one's piss.
I know  I've sat there 

I've slept there and did
most of my childhood.
That was warmth  in fact 

and comfort  in spite
of the unconcealed
unconcealable

smell. Terror? That was
and always will be
Mother cursing Dad

and there there I am
alone in that night
hearing that door slam.





Flounder
 

Here, she said, put this on your head.
She handed me a hat.
You 'bout as white as your dad,
and you gone stay like that.

Aunt Sugar rolled her nylons down
around each bony ankle,
and I rolled down my white knee socks
letting my thin legs dangle,

circling them just above water
and silver backs of minnows
flitting here then there between
the sun spots and the shadows.

This is how you hold the pole
to cast the line out straight.
Now put that worm on your hook,
throw it out and wait.

She sat spitting tobacco juice
into a coffee cup.
Hunkered down when she felt the bite,
jerked the pole straight up

reeling and tugging hard at the fish
that wriggled and tried to fight back.
A flounder, she said, and you can tell
'cause one of its sides is black.

The other side is white, she said.
It landed with a thump.
I stood there watching that fish flip-flop,
switch sides with every jump.





On the Steps of the Jefferson Memorial
 

We invent our gods
the way the Greeks did,
in our own image--but magnified.
Athena, the very mother of wisdom,
squabbled with Poseidon
like any human sibling
until their furious tempers 
made the sea writhe.

Zeus wore a crown
of lightning bolts one minute,
a cloak of feathers the next,
as driven by earthly lust
he prepared to swoop
down on Leda.
Despite their power,
frailty ran through them

like the darker veins
in the marble of these temples
we call monuments.
Looking at Jefferson now,
I think of the language
he left for us to live by.
I think of the slave
in the kitchen downstairs.





Exegesis of the First Words Spoken (Ishmael)
 

Scholar-on-waves, a water-gazer,
Call me

Ishmael. Re-enter my own life.
Waves: they murmur, babble, waves

Do not articulate what the ocean
Turning in its bed thinks: What must be said.

          Sing above or sing
          Below
          The knot in the plank, the cursive
          Pine-grain
          Of my life in the bow and my life

          Bay-less in the bowels
          Of the bow

I signed myself on as me
                                     to become more so
                                                                  myself--
A study, one volume of 36 signatures, 576 pages (9 blank for notes),
And became dispossessed of all
                                              but one mis-
                                              spoken leaf--
Pro- and epilogue both. Sign your mark. I do

Find the escape

Clause titled in fine print, watermarked, on condition

Of being or becoming: me

Tar-dark, thumbless or thumbed,
Ocean eats the nib of pen
But a nub dipped in pitch

          Sing above or sing below
          The wave's back
          Broken by another wave

          There is no air besides

A nub dipped in pitch
Can't help

But write, beneath the sea-hawk's wing
The sea-hawk's cry, Sign your mark

With a nail, a splinter, a harpoon
In the hand can't help

But
          Sing above and sing below
But write but
          What song strides surface tension
Help but write
          Thirst chokes and salt slakes
A contract for a name

Of being or becoming
Ink on the line, a name or a contract

For a name, a thumbprint, or I
Signed me on on my name alone: Now

Profit Now Leak Now Bury Now Speak.





Moby Dick
 

No reverie begs "light in the blind eye.
Reverie says: dig this depth-of-blank

Deeper. Dig deeper
With the Whale below the white-capped waves--

A twitch of his tail, a twitch of his white tail
Birthed from ocean-bed the wave

That broke calm water into each cracked plank
Of the harpooner's boat, made that man sway,

And cast him on the spear his arm meant to cast
At you. Beneath the sun's evil weight

Men burn nightwards but never darken
Past night. There's always the moon's hook

On still water to deny them.
But Whale, you dive down

Until the ocean's ground begs you solid, "Stop.
Whale, you do not stop.

You beat your head against the jagged rocks.
Blind in depths so dark light itself is blind,

You knock your head against the rocks to see
And scratch the god-itch from your thoughts.

Flame is jealous of flame, once lit, it ever
Reaches higher. You wait, match-tip, White Whale.

I see how you wait in silence for silence
To say: write it in, tell me who I am now.





Ishmael, or The Orphan
 

          Before the God-bullied hull, call me--
          Before the God-bullied hull buckles, before

          The red flag unfurled on water bucks and drowns,
          Before the sky-hawk dives down, before

          The nail drives through the sky-hawk's red-wing--
          Call me
                      the nail driven through the wing
          And call me the wing driven through.
                                                                A board
          On water is buoyant, I know: I cling to wood--
          A dictionary buckles and drowns. I know

          I do not drown: I'm abridged, afloat, call me--

Sir, when my book arrives, when each page
You've untied lets go the breath it held
That was my breath, then my breath will not be mine--
I think you'll know. I know when doors open
I mean to keep closed: study-door, desk-drawer.
My wife found the key I hid beneath the fern.
My pens she did not touch. She did not touch
The hundred pages I left blank to fill other days.
She took the cracked compass I keep for luck
(the needle's sharp, but stuck), took my green-glass
Ink-pot, and centering the compass on my desk,
Poured out each dark drop of ink unitl ink
Seeped through cracked glass and left the compass
Ink-full. The gold needle loosened, floated: a line.

          Bent back, I am taking you inside my head
          Turning back. Ahab bent

          The needle that refused North
                                                      back to a magnet's tow--
          Did, Ahab did, after
          The needle's faith answered our question: No.

          How do you point at a horizon? Ask me. I know.
          Needle out your arm: close eyes:

          And turn in a circle. Inscribe a zero on the wood-deck--
          The Equator on zero
                              latitudes lies. That is the truth, I know

Sir, what name that bay a last page carves
Out of no shore: ice? glacier? greenland?
strand, shoal-of-white-sand? an artic-calm?
How live, Sir, there--where I've been sailing?
Let me list for you, the cargo in my hold:
A brush, a mirror gilt-in-gold, a gold strand
Of wife's hair, a dirty plate, a sink with no water,
A white-sheeted bed, a finger with a ring
That the ring hates. Sir, these bound pages
Are bound for you. I've a compass
Full of ink. I see I need repair, plank
By plank, my boat, while ocean-bound, while afloat.

          I'm
          Orphan, Ishmael, Equator-Line:

          A man alone equals the wave before it crests,
          Wave, before crest, equals the needle turning,
          Needle turning equals the flinch of a hawk-wing,
          A hawk-wing's flinch is heaven turning

          Away. Men swallow water

Sir, I meant not to be so much myself
As I am. I meant to keep my mouth closed
When wife asked, "Should I go? and I said: "Go.
Bow-of-the-bed, empty bow. I'm captain,
I guess, now. I fold the blank sheet back
Each morning. There's a page I mean to read.
No hand wrote it. It's white. It hides white
Inside another page of white. How, Sir--
Open a page inside a page? How, Sir, do you
Read the page that was written so you could not
Read it. I know, I think I know. You sleep,
Or step, or slip beneath the surface of the bed
And learn to breathe as paper breathes: with other's breath.

          And then water swallows men. A grave-magnet
          Pulls them down. Fathom me--

          Editor, fathom me. I am a known depth. I'm a
          Definition easy: a man, a mortal man.

          A man with five needles on each hand
          Pointing heavenward. Heed me. I'm lost.






from The Poet Writes The Poem That Will Certainly Make Him Famous
 


                                       0.
 the first line? "blackface is sometimes the truth.
 the poet knows this will make fire.
  
 ponders performing in some dark room, squinting at the black type--
 red gel spots like laser sights from a rifle big as a bus.
 
but here, the sniper stirs herbal tea, has a cell phone,
the number of a woman the color of thrush wings.
  
 for now: the sniper with the cell phone will be he.
 
 he misses the next line beneath the spoon clanging in the mug
 like the clapper in a schooner's alarm bell. the third line,
  
 perhaps: ". . . the smoldering cork testifies . . . or ". . . the moldy corpse
   terrifies . . .
 he considers each. and wonders about the second line
  
--then about the girl he saw boarding the bus,
 what her name sounds like whispered in a dim room
  
 of red candles, a radio where the poet is. "--ncing and bucking.
 and the yes and suh . . .--he misses something else,
  
 the new line of little to do with corks or corpses--courts, maybe--
 and what's ". . . un a gold coin promise, layaway heaven with teeth and
   silence . . .?
  
 he is lost between a poem, a cell and a thrush's wing.
  
 so by this time the poet should probably place a refrain
 as this is going to be a long poem, long enough to make the poet famous.

what is the cork, still smelling of cheap wine, some doe-

cardboard under his left sock, the bootblack ache slithering out
above his ass, the bootblack cash kissed in waxy fingerprints
 
offered up, offered up to the waitress who won't smile for a "what this get?

fire gleaming off the platter
 like a breakfast of stars,
 burning cork
 
from Portugal, and cork
doesn't sink in rough waters,
 like fine schooners
 
from Portugal, and fire
 splits the blackness of dark
 like the fingers of sailors
 
from Portugal, whose tongues
teach new tongues to the lips
in the darkness of blacks
 
from Africa, and burn
 the sea into their faces
 like smoke in a blue lit
 
dressing room. and I
 close the magazine
 full of rappers swimming
 
in denim, ism smoke
and wait for the door

 a rusty bicycle is a copper skeleton against the mattress.
 through the chain link, children kneeling on the concrete
  
 look lined for butchering. chewed sedans bleed into the street,
 into sewer bellies.
  
 I've written these images too many times. DC is my ghetto--
 every black poet should have one, as every white poet should have
  
 a movie-house or a lake. white poets have attractions.
  
 black poets should also have grandmothers.
 
 I have grandmothers--one living, one not. neither mopped
 any floor but her own. if I stand on their memories, I am too tall
  
 to be jammed into a tenement. black birds peck at my journals. my fingers
 work grime into Elm Place in LeDroit Park, divine urine from Florida Ave
 
 and goad fiends from T Street's throat. these are not my muses.

I must imagine what might go on behind bricks, past the railing
 climbing up the stoops like wrought iron centipedes. the windows are open
 
sometimes at night. it was hot,
 one black grandmother had a pool. air conditioning. on days without smog,
 
 you could see the sea or someone riding a horse
past the liquor store. no one needs horses in Altadena. here,
 
horses are diamond necklaces. diamond necklaces that shit in crosswalks.
 in DC there is a different kind of horse, and I need it for poems as I need ink.
 
it is not my muse, nahmean? one black grandmother didn't sit in
 the back of buses. Raleigh lay before her, already mopped. the crows are waiting
 
at the edge of the page. see, the madhouse that seeped out into NE
before exploding into panhandlers stranded in phantom ants,
 
drifting mothers birthing flying dutchmen, that man who walked
 all the way to 6th Street swinging a golf club like a white woman dancing--
 
these are not my muses.
they aren't even mirrors.
 
they are cork awaiting flame.

Alameda Street
 

for Deshawn, Eric, Dallas, Jerome & Lerone
We brown boys
           play
                      stick games,
           say
                      nicknames
 like BIG D, EVIL E;
 and conjure Knievel
 with jigsawed dirt bikes
 and sewer curbs
 for asphalt launch pads.
           We all sweat
           to know flight
           for just
           a minute.

 We brown boys,
           hair
                      all knaps,  
           wear
                      ballcaps'
 broken brims. Broken rims
 from hungry slamdunks,
 pro-ball pipe dreams
 over ice cream man's
 "Pop Goes the Weasel.
           We all hunt
           change from cords',
           Bermudas
           and mamas.

 We brown boys--
           smack
                     talking
           slap
                     boxing--
 stay bragging and bagging,
 drinking summer from hoses
 and water bomb barrages.
 We throw rocks at garages
 making no dents.
          We all just
           trying to leave
           a mark.






The Poet as Setting
 

The jolt that comes to bones inside a tumbled streetcar

 is what the painter considers as she strokes her-
self into story. There is less to the jolt that
  
 comes as he shuts his eyes before the monitor, save

 what he imagines--a lightning bolt, a god tapping
the shoulder. He imagines the sky swelling
 
 with ceiling fans or the guano of extinct birds,
  
 a jolt riding from his shoulder
 blades to his eyelids, dropping with roller
  
 coaster clacks to his fingers. Here, he dreams of Frida

 Kahlo. Here, he says, let me spread my flesh out like a
 table linen, let my bones be silver that touches,
  
 making, again, that clack. My skull will be a glass,
  
 set properly, I have class enough. What jolt is
 it to chew over class, his body set before him as

 a reader sips (perhaps) a glass of something heady? We give
  
 books spines, we break them. The table will have
 its legs, its head. The body is upon us. Does the table have

 a stomach? Is it simply there to bear our hunger
 
without its own, like a eunuch bathing a stripper?
What is the poet without eyes or ears--reading, listening? He is
  
 a platform--a place to set, that to set it with. And if this is
 
all, what will he do when the reader finishes a glass,
rises from the poet's head, and passes
 
into the city? Covered with a linen, he is waiting for
  
 something to spill, perhaps a girl in Mexico rolling 
her ankle in a street-
  
 car.






The Orange Alert
 

Picture the upturned millipede, dead,
            and see the streets of Altadena:
 palm tree rows against the concrete, stiff
            to the horizon.
 There have been no birds big enough,
            we are comforted, to pluck
 the chitins from before our yards
            and vanish
 into the sun like dog-fighting MiGs.
            War bears litters of similes.

 Altadena, smog hugs the foothills like mustard gas
           where our rich peer through their blinds
 into ravines, Santa Anas sway the mustard plants, yuccas
            bob, some man--his cigarette,
 a full gas-can, an itch. We've known
            the orange alert, fires reaching for helicopters
 like cartoon cats clawing at panicked birds.
  
 Yesterday, fire engines and HAZMAT trucks
           jostled at Alameda and El Molino
like beetles eating a four-legged spider.
            That morning, radios warned of orange.
 Neighborhood kids watched officers climb in
            and out an open manhole,
 consulting the entrails of the great dead millipede.
            We watched the ground;
 the sun hotter than all year.
            The mountains hid Santa Anas,
 the smog went orange with dusk, the growing shadows
            of lingering birds.






The Only Portrait of Emily Dickinson
 

The straight neck held up out of the lace
 is bound with a black velvet band.
 She holds her mouth the way she chooses,
 the full underlip constrained by a small muscle.

 She doesn't blink or look aside,
 although her left eye is considering
 a slant. She would smile
 if she had time, but right now

 there is composure to be invented.
 She stares at the photographer.
 The black crepe settles. Emerging
 from the sleeve, a shapely hand

 holds out a white, translucent blossom.
 "They always say things which embarrass
 my dog, she tells the photographer.
She is amused, but not as much as he'd like.






Visiting My Gravesite: Talbott Churchyard, West Virginia
 

Maybe because I was married and felt secure and dead
 at once, I listened to my father's urgings about "the future

 and bought this double plot on the hillside with a view
 of the bare white church, the old elms, and the creek below. 

 I plan now to use both plots, luxuriantly spreading out
 in the middle of a big double bed. --But no,

 finally, my burial has nothing to do with marriage, this lying here
 in these same bones will be as real as anything I can imagine

 for who I'll be then, as real as anything undergone, going back
and forth to "the world out there, and here to this one spot

 on earth I really know. Once I came in fast and low
in a little plane and when I looked down at the church, 

the trees I've felt with my hands, the neighbors' houses
 and the family farm, and I saw how tiny what I loved or knew was, 

 it was like my children going on with their plans and griefs
 at a distance and nothing I could do about it. But I wanted

 to reach down and pat it, while letting it know
 I wouldn't interfere for the world, the world being 

 everything this isn't, this unknown buried in the known.






Wi-gi-e
 

Anna Kyle Brown. Osage.1896-1921. Fairfax, Oklahoma.

Because she died where the ravine falls into water. 

 Because they dragged her down to the creek.

 In death, she wore her blue broadcloth skirt.

 Though frost blanketed the grass she cooled her feet in the spring.

 Because I turned the log with my foot. 

 Her slippers floated downstream into the dam.

 Because, after the thaw, the hunters discovered her body.

  
 Because she lived without our mother.

 Because she had inherited head rights for oil beneath the land. 

 She was carrying his offspring.

 The sheriff disguised her death as whiskey poisoning.

 Because, when he carved her body up, he saw the bullet hole in her skull.

 Because, when she was murdered, the leg clutchers bloomed.

 But then froze under the weight of frost.

 During Xtha-cka Zhi-ga Tze-the, the Killer of the Flowers Moon.

 I will wade across the river of the blackfish, the otter, the beaver.

 I will climb the bank where the willow never dies.






Under the Dome
 

At times they will fly under. The dome
 contains jungles. Invent a sky under the dome.

 Creatures awake, asleep, at play, aglow:
 they float  unbottled genii  under the dome.

 Southern Belle, a splash of black, dusted with gold,
dissembles, assembling, acts shy under the dome.

 Cattleheart, Giant Swallowtail, Clipper:
 sail, navigate sky high under the dome.

 Like confetti  a wedding  bits of Rice
Paper: sheer mimicry under the dome.

 Magnificent Owl, in air, a pansy,
 it feeds, wings up, eye to eye, under the dome.
 
Name them: Monarch, then Queen, last Viceroy.
What will scientists deify under the dome?
 
Basking against a leaf: a Banded Orange,
displayed like a bowtie under the dome.

A living museum. Exist to be observed:
never migrate, but live, then die, under the dome.

Lips, lashes, eyes. From outside in,
do beings magnify under the dome?

Lepidoptera. From the Greek: Scale-wing.
Chrysalis. Stay, butterfly, under the dome.






The Story of Light
 

Think of the woman who first touched fire
to a hollow stone filled with seal oil,
 how she fiddled with fuel and flame
 until blue shadows before and after her
 filled her house, crowded
 the underground, then
 fled like sky-captains
 chasing the aurora's whale tale
 green beyond the earth's curve.
 Her tenth summer, the elders let her
 raise her issum, seal pup orphaned
 when hunters brought in her mother,
 their grins of plenty
 broad, red. The women
 slit the hard belly.
 Plopped among the ruby innards
 steaming on rough-cut planks
 blinked a new sea-child
 whose first sound
 came out a question
 in the old language, a question
 that in one throaty bark
 asked who, meaning What family
 is this? What comfort
 do you provide for guests?
 Do you let strangers remain
 strangers? The women rinsed the slick pup
 in cool water, crafted a pouch
 for her to suck. Then the young girl
 whose hands held light
 even when the room did not
 brought this new being
 beside her bed, let it scatter
 babiche and split birch
 gathered for snowshoes, let it
 nose the caribou neck hairs
 bearding her dance fans. They
 held up the fans to their foreheads,
 playing white hair, playing old.
 In the time when women do not sew
 the seal danced at her first potlatch.
 And when the lamps burned down,
 no one could see
 any difference between waves
 in rock, waves in sea.
 The pup lifted her nose, licked
 salt from seven stars, and slipped
 light back among silvers and chum
 light among the ghostly belugas
 swimming far north to offer themselves.






What to Count On
 

Not one star, not even the half moon          
       on the night you were born
 Not the flash of salmon
        nor ridges on blue snow
 Not the flicker of raven's
        never-still eye
 Not breath frozen in fine hairs
        beading the bull moose's nostril
 Not one hand under flannel
        warming before reaching
 Not burbot at home under Tanana ice
        not burbot pulled up into failing light
 Not the knife blade honed, not the leather sheath
 Not raw bawling in the dog yard
        when the musher barks gee
 Not the gnawed ends of wrist-thick sticks
        mounded over beaver dens
 Not solar flares scouring the earth over China
 Not rime crystals bearding a sleek cheek of snow
 Not six minutes more of darkness each day
 Not air water food words touch
 Not art
 Not anything we expect
 Not anything we expect to keep
 Not anything we expect to keep us alive

 Not the center of the sea
 Not the birthplace of the waves
 Not the compass too close to true north to guide us 

 Then with no warning
        flukes of three orcas
                  rise, arc clear of sea water






Indian Summer
 

There's a farm auction up the road.
Wind has its bid in for the leaves.
Already bugs flurry the headlights
between cornfields at night.
If this world were permanent,
I could dance full as the squaw dress
on the clothesline.
I would not see winter
in the square of white yard-light on the wall.
But something tugs at me.
The world is at a loss and I am part of it
migrating daily.
Everything is up for grabs
like a box of farm tools broken open.
I hear the spirits often in the garden
and along the shore of corn.
I know this place is not mine.
I hear them up the road again.
This world is a horizon, an open sea.
Behind the house, the white iceberg of the barn.

I feel your
absence in
the morning
& imagine your
instant mouth

I see wild wild wild

Keep letting the

Big fisherman
I love my
Friends.

I want to lean
my everything
with you
make home for your hubris
I want to read the words you circld over and over again
A slow skunk walking across the road
Yellow, just kind
of pausing
picked up the warm
laundry. I just saw a coyote
tippy tippy tippy
I didn't tell you about the creature with hair
long hair, it was hit by cars on the highway
Again and again. It had long grey hair
It must've been a dog; it could've been
Ours. Everyone loses their friends.

I couldn't tell anyone about this sight.
Each defeat
Is sweet.





Movie
 

You're like
a little fruit
you're like
a moon I want
to hold
I said lemon slope
about your 
hip
because it's one
of my words
about you
I whispered
in bed
this smoothing
the fruit &
then alone
with my book
but writing
in it the pages
wagging
against my knuckles
in the
light like a
sail.





Grief Calls Us to the Things of This World
 

The morning air is all awash with angels--Richard Wilbur, "Love Calls Us to the Things of This World

The eyes open to a blue telephone
In the bathroom of this five-star hotel.

I wonder whom I should call? A plumber,
Proctologist, urologist, or priest?

Who is blessed among us and most deserves
The first call? I choose my father because

He's astounded by bathroom telephones.
I dial home. My mother answers. "Hey, Ma,

I say, "Can I talk to Poppa? She gasps,
And then I remember that my father

Has been dead for nearly a year. "Shit, Mom,
I say. "I forgot he's dead. I'm sorry--

How did I forget? "It's okay, she says.
"I made him a cup of instant coffee

This morning and left it on the table--
Like I have for, what, twenty-seven years--

And I didn't realize my mistake
Until this afternoon. My mother laughs

At the angels who wait for us to pause
During the most ordinary of days

And sing our praise to forgetfulness
Before they slap our souls with their cold wings.

Those angels burden and unbalance us.
Those fucking angels ride us piggyback.

Those angels, forever falling, snare us
And haul us, prey and praying, into dust.





The Magic of Numbers
 

                                   The Magic of Numbers--1

How strange it was to hear the furniture being moved around in the apartment upstairs!
I was twenty-six, and you were twenty-two.


                                   The Magic of Numbers--2

You asked me if I wanted to run, but I said no and walked on.
I was nineteen, and you were seven.


                                   The Magic of Numbers--3

Yes, but does X really like us?
We were both twenty-seven.


                                   The Magic of Numbers--4

You look like Jerry Lewis (1950).


                                   The Magic of Numbers--5

Grandfather and grandmother want you to go over to their house for dinner.
They were sixty-nine, and I was two and a half.


                                   The Magic of Numbers--6

One day when I was twenty-nine years old I met you and nothing happened.


                                   The Magic of Numbers--7

No, of course it wasn't I who came to the library!
Brown eyes, flushed cheeks, brown hair. I was twenty-nine, and you were sixteen.


                                  The Magic of Numbers--8

After we made love one night in Rockport I went outside and kissed the road
I felt so carried away. I was twenty-three, and you were nineteen.


                                  The Magic of Numbers--9

I was twenty-nine, and so were you. We had a very passionate time.
Everything I read turned into a story about you and me, and everything I did was turned into a poem.





The Circus
 

I remember when I wrote The Circus
I was living in Paris, or rather we were living in Paris
Janice, Frank was alive, the Whitney Museum
Was still on 8th Street, or was it still something else?
Fernand Lger lived in our building
Well it wasn't really our building it was the building we lived in
Next to a Grand Guignol troupe who made a lot of noise
So that one day I yelled through a hole in the wall
Of our apartment I don't know why there was a hole there
Shut up! And the voice came back to me saying something
I don't know what. Once I saw Lger walk out of the building
I think. Stanley Kunitz came to dinner. I wrote The Circus
In two tries, the first getting most of the first stanza;
That fall I also wrote an opera libretto called Louisa or Matilda.
Jean-Claude came to dinner. He said (about "cocktail sauce)
It should be good on something but not on these (oysters).
By that time I think I had already written The Circus
When I came back, having been annoyed to have to go
I forget what I went there about
You were back in the apartment what a dump actually we liked it
I think with your hair and your writing and the pans
Moving strummingly about the kitchen and I wrote The Circus
It was a summer night no it was an autumn one summer when
I remember it but actually no autumn that black dusk toward the post office
And I wrote many other poems then but The Circus was the best
Maybe not by far the best Geography was also wonderful
And the Airplane Betty poems (inspired by you) but The Circus was the best.

Sometimes I feel I actually am the person
Who did this, who wrote that, including that poem The Circus
But sometimes on the other hand I don't.
There are so many factors engaging our attention!
At every moment the happiness of others, the health of those we know and our own!
And the millions upon millions of people we don't know and their well-being to think about
So it seems strange I found time to write The Circus
And even spent two evenings on it, and that I have also the time
To remember that I did it, and remember you and me then, and write this poem about it
At the beginning of The Circus
The Circus girls are rushing through the night
In the circus wagons and tulips and other flowers will be picked
A long time from now this poem wants to get off on its own
Someplace like a painting not held to a depiction of composing The Circus.

Noel Lee was in Paris then but usually out of it
In Germany or Denmark giving a concert
As part of an endless activity
Which was either his career or his happiness or a combination of both
Or neither I remember his dark eyes looking he was nervous
With me perhaps because of our days at Harvard.

It is understandable enough to be nervous with anybody!

How softly and easily one feels when alone
Love of one's friends when one is commanding the time and space syndrome
If that's the right word which I doubt but together how come one is so nervous?
One is not always but what was I then and what am I now attempting to create
If create is the right word
Out of this combination of experience and aloneness
And who are you telling me it is or is not a poem (not you?) Go back with me though 
To those nights I was writing The Circus.
Do you like that poem? have you read it? It is in my book Thank You
Which Grove just reprinted. I wonder how long I am going to live
And what the rest will be like I mean the rest of my life.

John Cage said to me the other night How old are you? and I told him forty-six
(Since then I've become forty-seven) he said
Oh that's a great age I remember.
John Cage once told me he didn't charge much for his mushroom identification course (at the New School)
Because he didn't want to make a profit from nature

He was ahead of his time I was behind my time we were both in time
Brilliant go to the head of the class and "time is a river
It doesn't seem like a river to me it seems like an unformed plan
Days go by and still nothing is decided about
What to do until you know it never will be and then you say "time
But you really don't care much about it any more
Time means something when you have the major part of yours ahead of you
As I did in Aix-en-Provence that was three years before I wrote The Circus
That year I wrote Bricks and The Great Atlantic Rainway
I felt time surround me like a blanket endless and soft
I could go to sleep endlessly and wake up and still be in it
But I treasured secretly the part of me that was individually changing
Like Noel Lee I was interested in my career
And still am but now it is like a town I don't want to leave
Not a tower I am climbing opposed by ferocious enemies

I never mentioned my friends in my poems at the time I wrote The Circus
Although they meant almost more than anything to me
Of this now for some time I've felt an attenuation
So I'm mentioning them maybe this will bring them back to me
Not them perhaps but what I felt about them
John Ashbery Jane Freilicher Larry Rivers Frank O'Hara
Their names alone bring tears to my eyes
As seeing Polly did last night
It is beautiful at any time but the paradox is leaving it
In order to feel it when you've come back the sun has declined
And the people are merrier or else they've gone home altogether
And you are left alone well you put up with that your sureness is like the sun
While you have it but when you don't its lack's a black and icy night. I came home
And wrote The Circus that night, Janice. I didn't come and speak to you
And put my arm around you and ask you if you'd like to take a walk
Or go to the Cirque Medrano though that's what I wrote poems about
And am writing about that now, and now I'm alone

And this is not as good a poem as The Circus
And I wonder if any good will come of either of them all the same.






On the Great Atlantic Rainway
 

I set forth one misted white day of June
Beneath the great Atlantic rainway, and heard:
"Honestly you smite worlds of truth, but
Lose your own trains of thought, like a pigeon.
Did you once ride in Kenneth's machine?
"Yes, I rode there, an old man in shorts, blind,
Who had lost his way in the filling station; Kenneth was kind.
"Did he fill your motionless ears with resonance and stain?
"No, he spoke not as a critic, but as a man.
"Tell me, what did he say? "He said,
My eyes are the white sky, the gravel on the groundway my sad lament.'
"And yet he drives between the two. . . . "Exactly, Jane,

And that is the modern idea of fittingness,
To, always in motion, lose nothing, although beneath the
Rainway they move in threes and twos completely
Ruined for themselves, like moving pictures.
"But how other? "Formulalessness, to go from the sun
Into love's sweet disrepair. He would fondly express
Rain trees'--which is not a poem, rain trees. . . .'
"Still, it is mysterious to have an engine
That floats bouquets! and one day in the rear-vision
Mirror of his car we vowed delight,
The insufficiency of the silverware in the sunlight,
The dreams he steals from and smiles, losing gain.

"Yet always beneath the rainway unsyntactical
Beauty might leap up! "That we might sing
From smiles' ravines, Rose, the reverse of everything,
May be profaned or talked at like a hat.'
"Oh that was sweet and short, like the minuet
Of stars, which would permit us to seem our best friends
By silver's eminent lights! For nature is so small, ends
Falsely reign, distending the time we did
Behind our hope for body-work, riding with Kenneth.
Their voicing ceased, then started again, to complain
That we are offered nothing when it starts to rain
In the same way, though we are dying for the truth.





To You
 

I love you as a sheriff searches for a walnut
That will solve a murder case unsolved for years
Because the murderer left it in the snow beside a window
Through which he saw her head, connecting with
Her shoulders by a neck, and laid a red
Roof in her heart. For this we live a thousand years;
For this we love, and we live because we love, we are not
Inside a bottle, thank goodness! I love you as a
Kid searches for a goat; I am crazier than shirttails
In the wind, when you're near, a wind that blows from
The big blue sea, so shiny so deep and so unlike us;
I think I am bicycling across an Africa of green and white fields
Always, to be near you, even in my heart
When I'm awake, which swims, and also I believe that you
Are trustworthy as the sidewalk which leads me to
The place where I again think of you, a new
Harmony of thoughts! I love you as the sunlight leads the prow
Of a ship which sails
From Hartford to Miami, and I love you
Best at dawn, when even before I am awake the sun
Receives me in the questions which you always pose.





The Brassiere Factory
 

Is the governor falling
From a great height?
Arm in arm we fled the brassiere factory,
The motion-boat stayed on the shore!
I saw how round its bottom was
As you walked into southern France--
Upon the light hair of an arm
Cigar bands lay!
I kissed you then. Oh is my bar
The insect of your will? The water rose,
But will the buffalo on
The nickel yet be still?
For how can windows hold out the light
In your eyes!
Darling, we fled the brassiere factory
In forty-eight states,
Arm in arm,
When human beings hung on us
And you had been arrested by the cloths
Were used in making, and I said, "The Goths
Know such delight, but still we fled, away
Into a dinner atmosphere
From all we knew, and fall asleep this day.
O maintenance men, with cruel eyes,
Then arm in arm we fled the listless factory!
The music changed your fingers' ends to pearl,
I punched you, you foolish girl,
For thanks to the metronome we got out alive, in the air
Where the sun filled us with cruelty!
There's what to do
Except despair, like pages! and laugh
Like prawns, about the sea!
Oh arm in arm we fled the industry
Into an earth of banks
And foolish tanks, for what bare breasts might be.





Fresh Air
 

                                                      I

 At the Poem Society a black-haired man stands up to say
 "You make me sick with all your talk about restraint and mature talent!
 Haven't you ever looked out the window at a painting by Matisse,
 Or did you always stay in hotels where there were too many spiders crawling on your visages?
 Did you ever glance inside a bottle of sparkling pop,
 Or see a citizen split in two by the lightning?
 I am afraid you have never smiled at the hibernation
 Of bear cubs except that you saw in it some deep relation
 To human suffering and wishes, oh what a bunch of crackpots!
 The black-haired man sits down, and the others shoot arrows at him.
 A blond man stands up and says,
 "He is right! Why should we be organized to defend the kingdom
 Of dullness? There are so many slimy people connected with poetry,
 Too, and people who know nothing about it!
 I am not recommending that poets like each other and organize to fight them,
 But simply that lightning should strike them.
 Then the assembled mediocrities shot arrows at the blond-haired man.
 The chairman stood up on the platform, oh he was physically ugly!
 He was small-limbed and boned and thought he was quite seductive,
 But he was bald with certain hideous black hairs,
 And his voice had the sound of water leaving a vaseline bathtub,
 And he said, "The subject for this evening's discussion is poetry 
 On the subject of love between swans. And everyone threw candy hearts
 At the disgusting man, and they stuck to his bib and tucker,
 And he danced up and down on the platform in terrific glee
 And recited the poetry of his little friends--but the blond man stuck his head
 Out of a cloud and recited poems about the east and thunder,
 And the black-haired man moved through the stratosphere chanting
 Poems of the relationships between terrific prehistoric charcoal whales,
 And the slimy man with candy hearts sticking all over him
 Wilted away like a cigarette paper on which the bumblebees have urinated,
 And all the professors left the room to go back to their duty,
 And all that were left in the room were five or six poets
 And together they sang the new poem of the twentieth century
 Which, though influenced by Mallarm, Shelley, Byron, and Whitman,
 Plus a million other poets, is still entirely original
 And is so exciting that it cannot be here repeated.
 You must go to the Poem Society and wait for it to happen.
 Once you have heard this poem you will not love any other,
 Once you have dreamed this dream you will be inconsolable,
 Once you have loved this dream you will be as one dead,
 Once you have visited the passages of this time's great art!


                                                      2

 "Oh to be seventeen years old
 Once again, sang the red-haired man, "and not know that poetry 
 Is ruled with the sceptre of the dumb, the deaf, and the creepy!
 And the shouting persons battered his immortal body with stones
 And threw his primitive comedy into the sea
 From which it sang forth poems irrevocably blue.
  
 Who are the great poets of our time, and what are their names?
 Yeats of the baleful influence, Auden of the baleful influence, Eliot of the baleful influence
 (Is Eliot a great poet? no one knows), Hardy, Stevens, Williams (is Hardy of our time?),
 Hopkins (is Hopkins of our time?), Rilke (is Rilke of our time?), Lorca (is Lorca of our time?), who is still of our time?
 Mallarm, Valry, Apollinaire, luard, Reverdy, French poets are still of our time,
 Pasternak and Mayakovsky, is Jouve of our time?
 
 Where are young poets in America, they are trembling in publishing houses and universities,
 Above all they are trembling in universities, they are bathing the library steps with their spit,
 They are gargling out innocuous (to whom?) poems about maple trees and their children,
 Sometimes they brave a subject like the Villa d'Este or a lighthouse in Rhode Island,
 Oh what worms they are! they wish to perfect their form.
 Yet could not these young men, put in another profession,
 Succeed admirably, say at sailing a ship? I do not doubt it, Sir, and I wish we could try them.
 (A plane flies over the ship holding a bomb but perhaps it will not drop the bomb,
 The young poets from the universities are staring anxiously at the skies,
 Oh they are remembering their days on the campus when they looked up to watch birds excrete,
 They are remembering the days they spent making their elegant poems.)
  
 Is there no voice to cry out from the wind and say what it is like to be the wind,
 To be roughed up by the trees and to bring music from the scattered houses
 And the stones, and to be in such intimate relationship with the sea
 That you cannot understand it? Is there no one who feels like a pair of pants?


                                                      3
  
 Summer in the trees! "It is time to strangle several bad poets.
 The yellow hobbyhorse rocks to and fro, and from the chimney
 Drops the Strangler! The white and pink roses are slightly agitated by the struggle,
 But afterwards beside the dead "poet they cuddle up comfortingly against their vase. They are safer now, no one will compare them to the sea.  

 Here on the railroad train, one more time, is the Strangler.
 He is going to get that one there, who is on his way to a poetry reading.
 Agh! Biff! A body falls to the moving floor.
 
 In the football stadium I also see him,
He leaps through the frosty air at the maker of comparisons
 Between football and life and silently, silently strangles him!
  
 Here is the Strangler dressed in a cowboy suit
Leaping from his horse to annihilate the students of myth!
 
 The Strangler's ear is alert for the names of Orpheus,
 Cuchulain, Gawain, and Odysseus,
 And for poems addressed to Jane Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald,
 To Ezra Pound, and to personages no longer living
 Even in anyone's thoughts--O Strangler the Strangler!
 
 He lies on his back in the waves of the Pacific Ocean.


                                                      4
  
 Supposing that one walks out into the air
 On a fresh spring day and has the misfortune
 To encounter an article on modern poetry 
 In New World Writing, or has the misfortune
 To see some examples of some of the poetry 
 Written by the men with their eyes on the myth
 And the Missus and the midterms, in the Hudson Review,
 Or, if one is abroad, in Botteghe Oscure,
 Or indeed in Encounter, what is one to do
 With the rest of one's day that lies blasted to ruins
 All bluely about one, what is one to do?
 O surely one cannot complain to the President,
 Nor even to the deans of Columbia College,
 Nor to T. S. Eliot, nor to Ezra Pound,
 And supposing one writes to the Princess Caetani,
 "Your poets are awful! what good would it do?
 And supposing one goes to the Hudson Review
 With a package of matches and sets fire to the building?
 One ends up in prison with trial subscriptions
 To the Partisan, Sewanee, and Kenyon Review!

  
                                                      5

 Sun out! perhaps there is a reason for the lack of poetry 
In these ill-contented souls, perhaps they need air! 

 Blue air, fresh air, come in, I welcome you, you are an art student,
 Take off your cap and gown and sit down on the chair.

 Together we shall paint the poets--but no, air! perhaps you should go to them, quickly, 
 Give them a little inspiration, they need it, perhaps they are out of breath,
 Give them a little inhuman company before they freeze the English language to death!
 (And rust their typewriters a little, be sea air! be noxious! kill them, if you must, but stop their poetry!
 I remember I saw you dancing on the surf on the Cte d'Azur,
 And I stopped, taking my hat off, but you did not remember me,
 Then afterwards you came to my room bearing a handful of orange flowers 
 And we were together all through the summer night!)

 That we might go away together, it is so beautiful on the sea, there are a few white clouds in the sky!
  
 But no, air! you must go . . . Ah, stay!

 But she has departed and . . . Ugh! what poisonous fumes and clouds! what a suffocating atmosphere!
 Cough! whose are these hideous faces I see, what is this rigor
 Infecting the mind? where are the green Azores,
 Fond memories of childhood, and the pleasant orange trolleys,
 A girl's face, red-white, and her breasts and calves, blue eyes, brown eyes, green eyes, fahrenheit
 Temperatures, dandelions, and trains, O blue?!
 Wind, wind, what is happening? Wind! I can't see any bird but the gull, and I feel it should symbolize . . .
 Oh, pardon me, there's a swan, one two three swans, a great white swan, hahaha how pretty they are! Smack!
 Oh! stop! help! yes, I see--disrespect for my superiors--forgive me, dear Zeus, nice Zeus, parabolic bird, O feathered excellence! white!
 There is Achilles too, and there's Ulysses, I've always wanted to see them,
 And there is Helen of Troy, I suppose she is Zeus too, she's so terribly pretty--hello, Zeus, my you are beautiful, Bang!
 One more mistake and I get thrown out of the Modern Poetry Association, help! Why aren't there any adjectives around?
 Oh there are, there's practically nothing else--look, here's grey, utter, agonized, total, phenomenal, gracile, invidious, sundered, and fused,
 Elegant, absolute, pyramidal, and . . . Scream! but what can I describe with these words? States!
 States symbolized and divided by two, complex states, magic states, states of consciousness governed by an aroused sincerity, cockadoodle doo!
 Another bird! is it morning? Help! where am I? am I in the barnyard? oink oink, scratch, moo! Splash! 
 My first lesson. "Look around you. What do you think and feel? Uhhh . . . "Quickly! This Connecticut landscape would have pleased Vermeer. Wham! A-Plus. "Congratulations! I am promoted.
 OOOhhhhh I wish I were dead, what a headache! My second lesson: "Rewrite your first lesson line six hundred times. Try to make it into a magnetic field. I can do it too. But my poor line! What a nightmare! Here comes a tremendous horse,
Trojan, I presume. No, it's my third lesson. "Look, look! Watch him, see what he's doing? That's what we want you to do. Of course it won't be the same as his at first, but . . . I demur. Is there no other way to fertilize minds?
 Bang! I give in . . . Already I see my name in two or three anthologies, a serving girl comes into the barn bringing me the anthologies,
 She is very pretty and I smile at her a little sadly, perhaps it is my last smile! Perhaps she will hit me! But no, she smiles in return, and she takes my hand.
 My hand, my hand! what is this strange thing I feel in my hand, on my arm, on my chest, my face--can it be . . . ? it is! AIR!
 Air, air, you've come back! Did you have any success? "What do you think? I don't know, air. You are so strong, air.
 And she breaks my chains of straw, and we walk down the road, behind us the hideous fumes!
Soon we reach the seaside, she is a young art student who places her head on my shoulder,
I kiss her warm red lips, and here is the Strangler, reading the Kenyon Review! Good luck to you, Strangler!
 Goodbye, Helen! goodbye, fumes! goodbye, abstracted dried-up boys! goodbye, dead trees! goodbye, skunks!
 Goodbye, manure! goodbye, critical manicure! goodbye, you big fat men standing on the east coast as well as the west giving poems the test! farewell, Valry's stern dictum!
 Until tomorrow, then, scum floating on the surface of poetry! goodbye for a moment, refuse that happens to land in poetry's boundaries! adieu, stale eggs teaching imbeciles poetry to bolster up your egos! adios, boring anomalies of these same stale eggs!
 Ah, but the scum is deep! Come, let me help you! and soon we pass into the clear blue water. Oh GOODBYE, castrati of poetry! farewell, stale pale skunky pentameters (the only honest English meter, gloop gloop!) until tomorrow, horrors! oh, farewell!

 Hello, sea! good morning, sea! hello, clarity and excitement, you great expanse of green--

 O green, beneath which all of them shall drown!






The History of Jazz
 

                                                       I

The leaves of blue came drifting down.
In the corner Madeleine Reierbacher was reading Lorna Doone.
The bay's water helped to implement the structuring of the garden hose.
The envelope fell. Was it pink or was it red? Consult Lorna Doone.
There, voyager, you will find your answer. The savant grapeade stands
Remember Madeleine Reierbacher. Madeleine Reierbacher says,
"If you are happy, there is no one to keep you from being happy;
Don't let them! Madeleine Reierbacher went into the racing car.
The racing car was orange and red. Madeleine Reierbacher drove to Beale Street.
There Maddy doffed her garments to get into some more comfortable clothes.
Jazz was already playing in Beale Street when Madeleine Reierbacher arrived there.
Madeleine Reierbacher picked up the yellow horn and began to play.
No one had ever heard anything comparable to the playing of Madeleine Reierbacher.
What a jazz musician! The pianist missed his beats because he was so excited.
The drummer stared out the window in ecstasy at the yellow wooden trees.
The orchestra played "September in the Rain, "Mugging, and "I'm Full of Love.
Madeleine Reierbacher rolled up her sleeves; she picked up her horn; she played "Blues in the Rain.
It was the best jazz anyone had ever heard. It was mentioned in the newspapers. St. Louis!
Madeleine Reierbacher became a celebrity. She played with Pesky Summerton and Muggsy Pierce.
Madeleine cut numerous disks. Her best waxings are "Alpha Beta and Gamma
And "Wing Song. One day Madeleine was riding on a donkey
When she came to a yellow light; the yellow light did not change.
Madeleine kept hoping it would change to green or red. She said, "As long as you have confidence,
You need be afraid of nothing. Madeleine saw the red smokestacks, she looked at the thin trees,
And she regarded the railroad tracks. The yellow light was unchanging. Madeleine's donkey dropped dead
From his mortal load. Madeleine Reierbacher, when she fell to earth,
Picked up a blade of grass and began to play. "The Blues! cried the workmen of the vicinity,
And they ran and came in great numbers to where Madeleine Reierbacher was.
They saw her standing in that simple field beside the railroad track
Playing, and they saw that light changing to green and red, and they saw that donkey stand up
And rise into the sky; and Madeleine Reierbacher was like a clot of blue
In the midst of the blue of all that sky, and the young farmers screamed
In excitement, and the workmen dropped their heavy boards and stones in their excitement,
And they cried, "O Madeleine Reierbacher, play us the Lead Flint Blues' once again!

O railroad stations, pennants, evenings, and lumberyards!
When will you ever bring us such a beautiful soloist again?
An argent strain shows on the reddish face of the sun.
Madeleine Reierbacher stands up and screams, "I am getting wet! You are all egotists!
Her brain floats up into the lyric atmosphere of the sky.
We must figure out a way to keep our best musicians with us.
The finest we have always melt in the light blue sky!
In the middle of a concert, sometimes, they disappear, like anvils.
(The music comes down to us with sweet white hands on our shoulders.)
We stare up in surprise; and we hear Madeleine's best-known tune once again,
"If you ain't afraid of life, life can't be afraid for you.
Madeleine! Come back and sing to us!


                                                      2

Dick looked up from his blackboard.
Had he really written a history of the jazz age?
He stared at his television set; the technicolor jazz program was coming on.
The program that day was devoted to pictures of Madeleine Reierbacher
Playing her saxophone in the golden age of jazz.
Dick looked at his blackboard. It was a mass of green and orange lines.
Here and there a red chalk line interlaced with the others.
He stared attentively at the program.

It was a clear and blue white day. Amos said, "The calibration is finished. Now there need be no more jazz.

In his mountain home old Lucas Dog laughed when he heard what Amos had said.
He smilingly picked up his yellow horn to play, but all that came out of it was steam.






Requiem for a Nest
 

the winged thang built her dream palace
amid the fine green eyes of a sheltering bough
she did not know it was urban turf
disguised as serenely delusionally rural
nor did she know the neighborhood was rife
with slant-mawed felines and those long-taloned
swoopers of prey. she was ignorant of the acidity & oil
that slowly polluted the earth, and was never
to detect the serpent coiled one strong limb below

following her nature she flitted and dove
for whatever blades twigs and mud
could be found under the humming blue
and created a hatchery for her spawn
not knowing all were doomed





from The Congo: Section 1
 

I. THEIR BASIC SAVAGERY 

Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room, 
Barrel-house kings, with feet unstable, 
Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table, 
Pounded on the table, 
Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom, 
Hard as they were able, 
Boom, boom, BOOM, 
With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom, 
Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM. 
THEN I had religion, THEN I had a vision. 
I could not turn from their revel in derision. 
THEN I SAW THE CONGO, CREEPING THROUGH THE BLACK, 
CUTTING THROUGH THE FOREST WITH A GOLDEN TRACK. 
Then along that riverbank 
A thousand miles 
Tattooed cannibals danced in files; 
Then I heard the boom of the blood-lust song 
And a thigh-bone beating on a tin-pan gong. 
And "BLOOD screamed the whistles and the fifes of the warriors, 
"BLOOD screamed the skull-faced, lean witch-doctors, 
"Whirl ye the deadly voo-doo rattle, 
Harry the uplands, 
Steal all the cattle, 
Rattle-rattle, rattle-rattle, 
Bing. 
Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM, 
A roaring, epic, rag-time tune 
From the mouth of the Congo 
To the Mountains of the Moon. 
Death is an Elephant, 
Torch-eyed and horrible, 
Foam-flanked and terrible. 
BOOM, steal the pygmies, 
BOOM, kill the Arabs, 
BOOM, kill the white men, 
HOO, HOO, HOO. 
Listen to the yell of Leopold's ghost 
Burning in Hell for his hand-maimed host. 
Hear how the demons chuckle and yell 
Cutting his hands off, down in Hell. 
Listen to the creepy proclamation, 
Blown through the lairs of the forest-nation, 
Blown past the white-ants' hill of clay, 
Blown past the marsh where the butterflies play: -- 
"Be careful what you do, 
Or Mumbo-Jumbo, God of the Congo, 
And all of the other 
Gods of the Congo, 
Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you, 
Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you, 
Mumbo-Jumbo will hoo-doo you.





The Light the Dead See
 

There are many people who come back
After the doctor has smoothed the sheet
Around their body
And left the room to make his call.

They die but they live.

They are called the dead who lived through their deaths,
And among my people
They are considered wise and honest.

They float out of their bodies
And light on the ceiling like a moth,
Watching the efforts of everyone around them.

The voices and the images of the living
Fade away.

A roar sucks them under
The wheels of a darkness without pain.
Off in the distance
There is someone
Like a signalman swinging a lantern.

The light grows, a white flower.
It becomes very intense, like music.

They see the faces of those they loved,
The truly dead who speak kindly.

They see their father sitting in a field.
The harvest is over and his cane chair is mended.
There is a towel around his neck,
The odor of bay rum.
Then they see their mother
Standing behind him with a pair of shears.
The wind is blowing.
She is cutting his hair.

The dead have told these stories
To the living.





Abandoned Farmhouse
 

He was a big man, says the size of his shoes
on a pile of broken dishes by the house; 
a tall man too, says the length of the bed
in an upstairs room; and a good, God-fearing man,
 says the Bible with a broken back
on the floor below the window, dusty with sun;
but not a man for farming, say the fields
cluttered with boulders and the leaky barn.

A woman lived with him, says the bedroom wall
papered with lilacs and the kitchen shelves
covered with oilcloth, and they had a child,
says the sandbox made from a tractor tire.
Money was scarce, say the jars of plum preserves
and canned tomatoes sealed in the cellar hole.
And the winters cold, say the rags in the window frames.
It was lonely here, says the narrow country road.

Something went wrong, says the empty house
in the weed-choked yard. Stones in the fields
say he was not a farmer; the still-sealed jars
in the cellar say she left in a nervous haste.
And the child? Its toys are strewn in the yard
like branches after a storm--a rubber cow,
a rusty tractor with a broken plow,
a doll in overalls. Something went wrong, they say.





Names We Sing in Sleep & Anger
 

Like fishermen at dusk, the soldiers returned
from war with stories slumped over their shoulders;
their fingers firm at the knot, the netting, thick
and tangled with the names of the dead.

None could explain how the flood of life all around
them escaped like water from between cupped hands,
how the bodies of men they loved began to crust
the earth like salt, how destruction danced slapdash
and unashamed everywhere, and still they survived.

When I came home from college proud, my educated
mouth agape, a tackle box of words, slick and glossy
and I saw the names of my friends, the young men
I fought with, learned to drink with, and left behind

Lil' Rocc, Pumpkin, Ulysses, Junebug, Aghoster
names spray-painted throughout our neighborhood
in memoriam, I couldn't understand how a god
could make one life possible and strip the world
clean of so many, or how, like high-watermarks
the dead remind the living of the coming of storms.





I Wasnt One of the Six Million: And What Is My Life Span? Open Closed Open
 

    I
My life is the gardener of my body. The brain--a hothouse closed tight
with its flowers and plants, alien and odd
in their sensitivity, their terror of becoming extinct.
The face--a formal French garden of symmetrical contours
and circular paths of marble with statues and places to rest,
places to touch and smell, to look out from, to lose yourself
in a green maze, and Keep Off and Don't Pick the Flowers.
The upper body above the navel--an English park
pretending to be free, no angles, no paving stones, naturelike,
humanlike, in our image, after our likeness,
its arms linking up with the big night all around.
And my lower body, beneath the navel--sometimes a nature preserve,
wild, frightening, amazing, an unpreserved preserve,
and sometimes a Japanese garden, concentrated, full of
forethought. And the penis and testes are smooth
polished stones with dark vegetation between them,
precise paths fraught with meaning 
and calm reflection. And the teachings of my father
and the commandments of my mother
are birds of chirp and song. And the woman I love
is seasons and changing weather, and the children at play
are my children. And the life my life.

     2
I've never been in those places where I've never been
and never will be, I have no share in the infinity of light-years and dark-years,
but the darkness is mine, and the light, and my time
is my own. The sand on the seashore--those infinite grains
are the same sand where I made love in Achziv and Caesarea.
The years of my life I have broken into hours, and the hours into minutes
and seconds and fractions of seconds. These, only these, 
are the stars above me
that cannot be numbered.

     3
And what is my life span? I'm like a man gone out of Egypt:
the Red Sea parts, I cross on dry land,
two walls of water, on my right hand and on my left.
Pharaoh's army and his horsemen behind me. Before me the desert, 
perhaps the Promised Land, too. That is my life span.

     4
Open closed open. Before we are born, everything is open
in the universe without us. For as long as we live, everything is closed
within us. And when we die, everything is open again. 
Open closed open. That's all we are.

    5
What then is my life span? Like shooting a self-portrait.
I set up the camera a few feet away on something stable
(the one thing that's stable in this world),
I decide on a good place to stand, near a tree,
run back to the camera, press the timer,
run back again to that place near the tree,
and I hear the ticking of time, the whirring
like a distant prayer, the click of the shutter like an execution.
That is my life span. God develops the picture
in His big darkroom. And here is the picture:
white hair on my head, eyes tired and heavy,
eyebrows black, like the charred lintels
above the windows in a house that burned down.
My life span is over.

     6
I wasn't one of the six million who died in the Shoah,
I wasn't even among the survivors.
And I wasn't one of the six hundred thousand who went out of Egypt.
I came to the Promised Land by sea.
No, I was not in that number, though I still have the fire and the smoke
within me, pillars of fire and pillars of smoke that guide me
by night and by day. I still have inside me the mad search
for emergency exits, for soft places, for the nakedness
of the land, for the escape into weakness and hope,
I still have within me the lust to search for living water
with quiet talk to the rock or with frenzied blows.
Afterwards, silence: no questions, no answers.
Jewish history and world history
grind me between them like two grindstones, sometimes
to a powder. And the solar year and the lunar year
get ahead of each other or fall behind,
leaping, they set my life in perpetual motion.
Sometimes I fall into the gap between them to hide,
or to sink all the way down.

    7
I believe with perfect faith that at this very moment
millions of human beings are standing at crossroads
and intersections, in jungles and deserts,
showing each other where to turn, what the right way is,
which direction. They explain exactly where to go,
what is the quickest way to get there, when to stop
and ask again. There, over there. The second
turnoff, not the first, and from there left or right,
near the white house, by the oak tree.
They explain with excited voices, with a wave of the hand
and a nod of the head: There, over there, not that there, the other there,
as in some ancient rite. This too is a new religion.
I believe with perfect faith that at this very moment.





Hayden
 

What did I know, what did I know
Of gazing silences and terrored stone

Brilliances; beauty of what's hardbitten
The auroral darkness which is God

Then you arrived, meditative, ironic
My head gripped in bony vice

Mouth of agony shaping a cry it cannot utter
What did I know, what did I know

Of a changing permanence
The stains and dirty tools of struggle

Weaving a wish and a weariness together
Years before your time. Years and years

I gaze through layered light
Within the rock of the undiscovered suns

I see, I walk with you among
The landscape lush, metallic, flayed

Behind us, beyond us now
The very sunlight here seems flammable





Big City
 

He promises a canary dress, white gloves,
says they'll eat chops, thick as her thighs,
that they'll order doubles of the "finest,
see all the Big Names when they arrive.
But it's the thought of them dead:
half of what they own draped around them,
her head against his chest, his back slack
against the headboard, all their letters unopened,
bills not paid, long knocks, the notices tacked
outside their door. It's not knowing
whether some smell would introduce them
to their neighbors or a landlord wheeling
them out into the hallway; the highboy
he chipped on the drive up, the silver
she inherited from her mother, her hatboxes,
stacked high next to them like a wedding cake
waiting to be buried. He heard that "up there
the wind had talons sharp enough to hook
a grown man beneath his collarbone and carry
him a full city block. He heard that you learned
the months by measuring the length of their shadows
and even summer was like a quality of night.





The Amen Stone
 

On my desk there is a stone with the word "Amen on it,
a triangular fragment of stone from a Jewish graveyard destroyed
many generations ago. The other fragments, hundreds upon hundreds,
were scattered helter-skelter, and a great yearning,
a longing without end, fills them all:
first name in search of family name, date of death seeks
dead man's birthplace, son's name wishes to locate
name of father, date of birth seeks reunion with soul
that wishes to rest in peace. And until they have found
one another, they will not find a perfect rest.
Only this stone lies calmly on my desk and says "Amen.
But now the fragments are gathered up in lovingkindness
by a sad good man. He cleanses them of every blemish,
photographs them one by one, arranges them on the floor
in the great hall, makes each gravestone whole again,
one again: fragment to fragment,
like the resurrection of the dead, a mosaic,
a jigsaw puzzle. Child's play.





Burlesque
 

Watch the fire undress him,
how flame fingers each button,
rolls back his collar, unzips him
without sweet talk or mystery.

See how the skin begins to gather
at his ankles, how it slips into
the embers, how it shimmers
beneath him, unshapen, iridescent

as candlelight on a dark negligee.
Come, look at him, at all his goods,
how his whole body becomes song,
an aria of light, a psalm's kaleidoscope.

Listen as he lets loose an opus,
night's national anthem, the tune
you can't name, but can't stop humming.
There, he burns brilliant as a blue note.





Aesthetics
 

we must know a forcegreater than our weaknesses            --Jean Toomer

like most boys, ignorant
or fearful of beauty, we
pinned back the wings

of butterflies and plucked
off their legs, and watched
and watched them tumble

from leaves like pinecones
wheeling from rooftops;
and we laughed.

we crumbled alka-seltzer
for the pigeons, "those
flying rats my mother's 

ex-husband once called.
their bodies floundering like
toys flung from a window.

white foam from their mouths
stark against the asphalt
framing their artless convulsions

and we laughed
with open-mouths until
tears dripped from our

chins and our throats
were raw with the rightness
of god.





Remembering Frost at Kennedys Inauguration
 

Even the flags seemed frozen
to their poles, and the men 
stamping their well-shod feet
resembled an army of overcoats.

But we were young and fueled
by hope, our ardor burned away
the cold. We were the president's,
and briefly the president would be ours.

The old poet stumbled
over his own indelible words,
his breath a wreath around his face:
a kind of prophecy.





Seventh Street
 

          Money burns the pocket, pocket hurts,
          Bootleggers in silken shirts,
          Ballooned, zooming Cadillacs,
          Whizzing, whizzing down the street-car tracks.


   Seventh Street is a bastrad of Prohibition and the War. A crude-boned, soft-skinned wedge of nigger life breathing its loafer air, jazz songs and love, thrusting unconscious rhythms, black reddish blood into the white and whitewashed wood of Washington. Stale soggy wood of Washington. Wedges rust in soggy wood. . . Split it! In two! Again! Shred it! . . the sun. Wedges are brilliant in the sun; ribbons of wet wood dry and blow away. Black reddish blood. Pouring for crude-boned soft-skinned life, who set you flowing? Blood suckers of the War would spin in a frenzy of dizziness if they drank your blood. Prohibition would put a stop to it. Who set you flowing? White and whitewash disappear in blood. Who set you flowing? Flowing down the smooth asphalt of Seventh Street, in shanties, brick office buildings, theaters, drug stores, restaurants, and cabarets? Eddying on the corners? Swirling like a blood-red smoke up where the buzzards fly in heaven? God would not dare to suck black red blood. A Nigger God! He would duck his head in shame and call for the Judgement Day. Who set you flowing?


          Money burns the pocket, pocket hurts,

Rises from their anguish and their power,

                                       Harriet Tubman,

                                       woman of earth, whipscarred,
                                       a summoining, a shining

                                       Mean to be free

          And this was the way of it, brethren brethren,
          way we journeyed from Can't to Can.
          Moon so bright and no place to hide,
          the cry up and the patterollers riding,
          hound dogs belling in bladed air.
          And fear starts a-murbling, Never make it,
          we'll never make it. Hush that now,
          and she's turned upon us, levelled pistol
          glinting in the moonlight:
          Dead folks can't jaybird-talk, she says;
          you keep on going now or die, she says.

Armed and known to be Dangerous

          mailed Jehovah coming to deliver me?

Hoot-owl calling in the ghosted air,
five times calling to the hants in the air.
Shadow of a face in the scary leaves,
shadow of a voice in the talking leaves:

          Come ride-a my train

          Oh that train, ghost-story train
          through swamp and savanna movering movering,
          over trestles of dew, through caves of the wish,
          Midnight Special on a sabre track movering movering,
          first stop Mercy and the last Hallelujah.

          Come ride-a my train

                   Mean mean mean to be free.





Her Head
 

Near Ekuvukeni,
in Natal, South Africa,
a woman carries water on her head.
After a year of drought,
when one child in three is at risk of death,
she returns from a distant well,
carrying water on her head.

The pumpkins are gone,
the tomatoes withered,
yet the woman carries water on her head.
The cattle kraals are empty,
the goats gaunt--
no milk now for children,
but she is carrying water on her head.

The engineers have reversed the river:
those with power can keep their power,
but one woman is carrying water on her head.
In the homelands, where the dusty crowds
watch the empty roads for water trucks,
one woman trusts herself with treasure,
and carries water on her head.

The sun does not dissuade her,
not the dried earth that blows against her,
as she carries the water on her head.
In a huge and dirty pail,
with an idle handle,
resting on a narrow can,
this woman is carrying water on her head.

This woman, who girds her neck
with safety pins, this one
who carries water on her head,
trusts her own head to bring to her people
what they need now
between life and death:
She is carrying them water on her head.





War Bird: A Journal
 

                      Poets' Anti-War Rally, 12 Feb. 2003
The massed and pillared wings of
the White House never fly--
        whitewashed yearly, they stand
impervious

        to metaphor,

to hawk and dove, and red armies
of ants. Only the halting squirrels
        investigate, creeping past the arrowhead
gates to scratch

        the Midas lawns

for treasure--On the street, commentators
wander like boys in a story too simple
        to explain. The political message,
a hat

        punched inside out:

once, the Nazis got word that Churchill
would visit Roosevelt "in Casa Blanca":
        U-Boats bobbed near the Potomac,
waiting for him...

        but Churchill,

as he said, was sailing to Morocco.
Reagan protesters splashed the Pentagon
        walls daily with cow blood--
soldiers waxed

        the plaster, and triremes

of rats licked the bloody grass;
the EPA sent health goons to stomp
        them, and the pacifists, away--
Then rats stormed

        the National Zoo:

urbane, patient inheritors of the earth,
they snapped prairie dogs like wishbones;
        vigilante zookeepers laced the ground
with poison,

        Carthage delenda est,

and killed the hippo. (Here, in the
New World Order, penguin and polar bear
        soak up ozone, and Nation shall
beat them both

        into ploughshares....)

Hawks and fat cats disdained
the White House squirrels, their proconsul
        Chevy Suburban nosed us aside:
we spoke

        against the war,

and for the cameras, spelled our names
on Chinese Radio--Elder poets shrewdly
        loitered at the lobbiest bar,
read first,

        then left us

to the falange of Secret Servicemen,
chatting like critics into their black
        lapels at every bungled line:
this was no

        singing school,

no falcon heard our crows and warbles...
Emily, our modest leader, rapped the gate:
        "Mrs. Bush wanted American poems--
I brought

        3,000,

all against the war. Can you take them?"
Gulping, the pimply guard asked his shirt
        for help; older hands hustled up,
"The Great Oz

        cannot see you..." etc.

Will four and twenty blackbirds fill
a cowboy hat? Bunkered belowdecks,
        the President goes for the burn,
racing the

        cut tongue

of his treadmill to a dead heat.
Even Nixon met the enemy once,
        strode with his staff into a red sea
of hippies--

        they didn't part,

and he burbled about baseball...
from his desk, he liked to watch
        the sightseers through a gap
in the hedges;

        peaceniks

learned this and blocked his view,
stood there day and night for years:
        Nixon, nightmare reality shanking
through his eyes,

        knelt with Kissinger:

Henry, he moaned, what do they want?....
Days from now, how many days,
        the Valentine "Woo at the Zoo" begins.
A hand-raised

        falcon bows,

and shares meat with its master....
He bows in turn, and eats;
        both softly whisper ee-chu,
ee-chu,

        a duet

heard only on abstract and crumbling
cliffs--if a man were to stand or
        sing there, he'd fall. The master
straps on a

        a falcon feathered

courtesan's hat and turns away--
Flapping wildly, the falcon claws
        the head-shape, squawking,
gyrating to

        hold on,

imperial lunge and lunge,
biting at the skull it fed, as
        semen slowly drips into a
rubber dam.








Monuments
 



           Today the moon sees fit to come between a parched earth
    and sun, hurrying the premature darkness. A rooster in the yard
            cuts off its crowing, fooled into momentary sleep.
               And soon the Perseid showers, broken bits
         of the ancient universe, will pass through the skin of our
            atmosphere. Time and space are alive over our city.
 
       Final eclipse of the sun, last of this millennium, our city's
        brightness broken off. We have known other dark hours:
            Here, coffin that slowly passes, I give you my sprig
        of lilac--Lincoln's death, winding procession toward sleep.
          We have known slave coffles and holding pens in yards
       not half a mile from our Capitol, wooden palings sunk in earth
 
       to guarantee none would escape. In this freest city. Oh if earth
              could talk. Earth does talk in the neatly framed yards
                where death thinks to lay us down to rest. Asleep,
                the marker stones. But not the voices, jagged bits
                of memory, shards of poems. Sterling Brown. Our
           human possessions and all they've left us. This whole city
 
                  sings their songs. Say their names. In this city
               they are our monuments: Frederick Douglass, our
             Rayford Logan, Alain Locke, Franklin Frazier, Georgia
       Douglas Johnson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, May Miller: Not sleep
        but garlands left to us. Montague Cobb, William Hastie. Yards
                 of names. And here, the place where we unearth
 
             an immigrant father of seven. He leans down--no earthly
           reason for his choice--to pick up his nearest child. A yard-long
             rack of brooms behind him, a bin of apples. Not the sleep
                   of cold, but autumn in Washington. 1913 or a bit
               later. He stands awkwardly on 4 1/2 Street, S. W. Our
                street photographer, who's just come by with his city
 
              chatter, ducks beneath a dark cloth. Monuments of the city
         behind him, he leans over his black box camera in time to capture
                       that moment when the child will play her bit
      part, pushing away from her father like a boat from shore. In the sleep
         of winter, years later, she will become my mother. What yardstick
                 by which to measure importance? To measure earthly
 
     agency? Each of us has monuments in the bone case of memory. Earth-    
 bound, I take my sac of marble and carry it down lonely city streets where our
generals on horseback and a tall bearded man keep watch over all their citizens.

 





My Fathers Left Hand
 

Sometimes my old man's hand flutters over his knee, flaps
in crazy circles, and falls back to his leg. 

Sometimes it leans for an hour on that bony ledge. 

And sometimes when my old man tries to speak, his hand waggles
in the air, chasing a word, then perches again

on the bar of his walker or the arm of a chair.

Sometimes when evening closes down his window and rain
blackens into ice on the sill, it trembles like a sparrow in a storm.

Then full dark falls, and it trembles less, and less, until it's still.





Urban Renewal XVIII.
 

How untouchable the girls arm-locked strutting
up the main hall of Central High unopposed
for decades looked. I flattened myself against
the wall, unnerved by their cloudsea of lan,
which pounced upon any timid girl regrettably
in their way, their high-wattage lifting slow motion
like curls of light strands of honey. The swagger
behind their blue-tinted sunglasses and low-rider
jeans hurt boys like me, so vast the worlds
between us, even the slightest whiff of recognition,
an accidental side glance, an unintended tongue-piercing
display of Juicy Fruit chew, was intoxicating
and could wildly cast a chess-playing geek into
a week-long surmise of inner doubts, likelihoods,
and depressions. You might say my whole life led
to celebrating youth and how it snubs and rebuffs.
Back then I learned to avoid what I feared
and to place my third-string hopes on a game-winning
basketball shot, sure it would slow them to a stop,
pan their lip-glossed smiles, blessing me with their cool.





The End and the Beginning
 

After every war
someone has to clean up.
Things won't
straighten themselves up, after all.

Someone has to push the rubble
to the side of the road,
so the corpse-filled wagons
can pass.

Someone has to get mired
in scum and ashes,
sofa springs,
splintered glass,
and bloody rags.

Someone has to drag in a girder
to prop up a wall.
Someone has to glaze a window,
rehang a door.

Photogenic it's not,
and takes years.
All the cameras have left
for another war.

We'll need the bridges back,
and new railway stations.
Sleeves will go ragged
from rolling them up.

Someone, broom in hand, 
still recalls the way it was.
Someone else listens
and nods with unsevered head.
But already there are those nearby
starting to mill about
who will find it dull.

From out of the bushes
sometimes someone still unearths
rusted-out arguments
and carries them to the garbage pile.

Those who knew
what was going on here
must make way for
those who know little.
And less than little.
And finally as little as nothing.

In the grass that has overgrown
causes and effects,
someone must be stretched out
blade of grass in his mouth
gazing at the clouds.





Sabbath lie
 

On Friday, at twilight of a summer day
While the smells of food and prayer rose from every house
And the sound of the Sabbath angels' wings was in the air,
While still a child I started to lie to my father:
"I went to another synagogue.

I don't know if he believed me or not
But the taste of the lie was good and sweet on my tongue
And in all the houses that night
Hymns rose up along with lies
To celebrate the Sabbath.
And in all the houses that night
Sabbath angels died like flies in a lamp,
And lovers put mouth to mouth,
Blew each other up until they floated upward,
Or burst.

And since then the lie has been good and sweet on my tongue
And since then I always go to another synagogue.
And my father returned the lie when he died:
"I've gone to another life.





Manifest
 

Sir star, Herr Lenz, white season body
master snapping masts in half, absent
winds' workmanship: what window
will I look you through, what brook, stream

creaking past fretwork weeds, clouds
in the context of cold? Lord knot
to be untied, skiff hard alee ill winds:
a hiss of wish and cinders and I

am warm, crossing dazed oceans by hand
to sow the doubtful sea with drought. Mine
of rain and seize and sluice, you change

your mind again, a rage for green waves'
open vowels, undrinkable. No talking
to the weeds, no talking with the snow.





The Appaloosa
 

The one horse you gave me
you took back when she went insane,
when she began to chew wood
instead of the expensive grain
we bought from the feed store,
the grain that had the sweet smell
of molasses and was good for even
us to chew. She turned into
an ugly thing with her wild thoughts,
and I forgot about the beauty
expected of her when her blanket 
filled out and complemented
her chestnut body and the name
the Nez Perc gave her. She rotted
and began to stink of promises 
gone wrong, of gods avenging
their defilement. A man who knew
what to do with useless horses
came and took her away in
a wooden trailer she tried to chew,
and my tears welled up in huge drops
before they splattered on the ground,
as I trembled and realized I would have
to give up her own ghost for her,
ghost which she did not have, ghost
which she came here beautifully without.






Eating Poetry
 

Ink runs from the corners of my mouth.
There is no happiness like mine.
I have been eating poetry.

The librarian does not believe what she sees.
Her eyes are sad
and she walks with her hands in her dress.

The poems are gone.
The light is dim.
The dogs are on the basement stairs and coming up.

Their eyeballs roll,
their blond legs burn like brush.
The poor librarian begins to stamp her feet and weep.

She does not understand.
When I get on my knees and lick her hand,
she screams.

I am a new man.
I snarl at her and bark.
I romp with joy in the bookish dark.





New Endymion
 

She visits still too much, dressed in aromas
of fir needles, mango, mold: I still get lost
knowing she's close, me not getting younger
or more conscious. Sometimes I fantasticate
I'm broad awake: her witchy presence waits
for me to jump into her arms, but then she's just 
an incoherent ache in sleep's freaked scenes.
I feel her frosty nitrogenous hands and wrists 
vaporing nooses around my head and feet
and genitals, conjuring my drab hair 
into a party bowl of oiled, desirable locks.
She makes me nervous, but what would I do
without her? So long as I can't have her,
I want her and this alarming manic frequency.
Then again, who wants to wake to change,
its pulped, smelly suit of meat, drawing flies?
My night-watch hot girl, moon-maiden, mom,
let me get just one night's sleep without regret,
released from your foxy ticklish fondlings,
your latest smell of windblown fresh-cut grass.






Renovations
 

going on everywhere
in summer's cold wind
winging through hollies.
Banana plants flap 
like canvas sails
above a dugout cellar
where Latino boys shoulder
cans of dirt, rocks.
Three doors down
more or less . . .
things feel approximate
like my window draft haunted
by Un'aura amorosa
I've listened and whistled to
too much this morning
that renews me bitterly
sweet like the mug
on the pit bull 
neighborhood kids adore,
recovering from surgery 
while his owner Mike or Fred
three doors down
lays Italian tiles
on his rebuilt stoop.
There's a small tremble
in the familiar orders
that keep us, that we keep,
the ocean's big breath
through high treetops,
then lower down
a housepainter's billowing
black nets suck and mash
above those Michoacns
digging a duplex foundation
for New World gold:
all those respirations
in the pushy nonstop wind
thrown like a threshold
between us and the trench,
us and whatever's there
underworld or overworld
where certain friends say
they will, at the end
of the things of this world,
be laid to rest,
but (I say) what rest?






The Ash Bringer
 

A grainy predawn dark, early Expressway traffic 
bleeding arterial tail lights across gray water 
and its blue heart. Under Lemon Hill, 
grunts from Boathouse Row, woodshop clunks, 
young men's voices too loud for a day 
exhaling into starless skies, bad boys
after keg night, hungover, push long sculls
into the water and slice its marcelled run, 
a marbled peacock wake behind each stroke
and coxswain counting that muscled steadiness
past the Water Works, Spring Garden Street Bridge
then Girard Avenue Bridge, where on the bank
Eakins sketches Max Schmitt in a single scull,
his light like this, tinfoil blue, where the crews sweat off
last night's lost time but won't row too far north 
to river canals, Manayunk Reach, its towpath,
mules and barges and anthracite from Point Carbon 
to feed stoves and Bessemers in Harrisburg, Pittsburgh . . .
Downriver, behind the boats and finny tracks: 
League Island, where cheats and pimply teens parked
and tricked fingers through nipple hairs, satiny tufts,
the shut-down Navy Yard, once staggering shore leave 
for so many thousands dead, how many more since,
in the rivers, of the rivers, like the girl 
at a bend near the Museum gazebo: she tips
a throe of ashes from a brassy urn,
kneeling, not pious, just there, slanting her head 
as if to speak to the passing, do it right,
shrug fine ores into the river--it takes so long
to cast away so little left of kin or friend
to Schuylkill, Delaware, Chesapeake, Atlantic, 
someone she knew, walked gardens with, and must have loved.






The Hen Swallows a Worm or Slug
 

We scratch at the backyard together
through leaf mould, worm casings she kicks off
in a fan behind her. I use a stick
to dig, to find for her what she's shown me
near the roots, at the edge of a step--sticky
slug on the underside of a hosta's leaf.
How complicated she is and how resigned.
Between her beak and my outstretched hand,
the worm's writhing. Then the long slick going
down. It fills the throat, like all that's swallowed.
        Her head chucks it back,
        for the worm again dark.
        The hen's pupil dilates.
        She wends and follows.

Her queries, sighs, low gurgles, the hastening
click of her nails on pavement then hungry
again into the grass. Grubs are larger
than pale yellow larvae I prize from inside
chestnuts. These mucousy blind wanderers
she eats right from my palm. Nevertheless I am
repulsed by my husband's embrace. I turn
now from his thick belly, breasts, his interests.
A body I had clambered over, loved.
I scrabble, struggle. I cover myself.
        Another sticky truth dug up
        that I must re-bury--
        sorry on hands and knees,
        hungry and wary.






Atmosphere
 

The canals of Mars
beseech various oxides, vast
dust storms
of a dulled red,
a daytime warmth
that only reaches so far.

Let's call these fissures canals
so we'll think of Venice
looking through our telescope
as Mars comes this close

in this our anniversary year
with its thin atmosphere
and, to be probed,
its extreme cold.






Foreword
 

I was conceived in the cruelest month
in whatever spring California could muster.
A little rain--with some more likely.
And the buckeyes were they yet on the ground?
Damn my father's smooth stone eyes,
other prevailing enticements and what Eliot called
the female stench. Damn the oaks, 
their histrionics, struggling in the fog.
Spiderwebs lay in the grass, misted
and looking like misspent galaxies.
I cry into and out of this moment.
Pound told Eliot: strike this and this.
What was weak got dropped, and the poem
stood stronger without it.





Painting over Aya Sofia
 

A lot of the painting here is painting over.
Can everyone at the back hear over everyone?
Everyone is a blast of light seeping across the film.
All day high toothy windows whiten in flashlight.

We are much like we were: five times a day.
Things don't change that much in five centuries.
For ten centuries before it was faces.
Those were faces, yes. They were angels.

The gold mosaic is as fine as an angel's velvet wing.
The Christian building is spongy yellow, ochre, gold.
The Islamic additions are sheer yellow, baby blue, black and gold.
Red crosses seep through baby blue.

A woman kisses her cross and crosses herself.
Another is kissed by a pink polo shirt and camera.
A camera will not put the rest of Christ back in.
It will not take away the crowd around Christ's toes.

The crowded reference image accompanying the fragments.
Pigeons wing through the high windows and up in fragments.
Christ's toes; Christ's fingertips; Christ's thigh; Christ on high.
Sandals expose toes in the highlights.






Language is her caravan
 

Frosty, green through gray rising steeply,
top of the bank a big top, red with a sign,
misty, fantastical on the walk to school.

"My sister can't express herself properly. 

Imagine if those performers
were stuck in their caravans
forever. If round the back of the big top
the doors were locked. That's her.

She's a trapeze artist, lion tamer,
cramped clean-faced clown
drinking tea, practicing tricks,
movement through frosted windows.

Language is her caravan on bricks,
with tiny little windows in.

At the weekend he and his sister
stood on the frosty bank
beside his metaphor. She read the poster
carefully, got them sat down in good time and at the back.

The trapeze artist, lion tamer, freshly-made-up clown
filled the top with a noise he could go on translating forever.

Walking home she opened her chest:
"I liked the mime best.






The Mission
 

Back there then I lived
         across the street from a home

for funerals--afternoons
         I'd look out the shades

& think of the graveyard
         behind Emily Dickinson's house--

how death was no
         concept, but soul

after soul she watched pour
         into the cold

New England ground.
         Maybe it was the sun

of the Mission,
         maybe just being

more young, but it was less
         disquiet than comfort

days the street filled with cars
         for a wake--

children played tag
         out front, while the bodies

snuck in the back. The only hint
         of death those clusters

of cars, lights low
         as talk, idling dark

as the secondhand suits
         that fathers, or sons

now orphans, had rescued
         out of closets, praying

they still fit. Most did. Most
         laughed despite

themselves, shook
         hands & grew hungry

out of habit, evening
         coming on, again--

the home's clock, broke 
         like a bone, always

read three. Mornings or dead
         of night, I wondered

who slept there & wrote letters 
         I later forgot

I sent my father, now find buoyed up 
         among the untidy

tide of his belongings.
         He kept everything

but alive. I have come to know 
         sorrow's

not noun
         but verb, something

that, unlike living, 
         by doing right

you do less of. The sun 
         is too bright.

Your eyes
         adjust, become

like the night. Hands
         covering the face--

its numbers dark
         & unmoving, unlike

the cars that fill & start
         to edge out, quiet

cortge, crawling, half dim, till
         I could not see to see--





The Cellar
 

Under the locked grille, the animals are crying.

You hear them while you wait and when the bus pulls up,

Finally, and you get on. That was many years ago.

The cellar is given over to new shopkeepers, one after the other,

Who fail and are replaced. Even the selfish brother,

The crazed neighbor, the criminal in his cell, face of blue

Tattoos, has never allowed a living thing to starve

As you have. Who knows this except for you and the laughing

African with his flashing gold teeth and padlock key.





On rain washed paper dried, ink
 

On rain washed paper dried, ink
still blurs. But all words
are stains. The paper's rippled
lunar, mountain and crater, 

and seas on the moon, misnomer 
of plains that looked like 
water once, no-end-to-it shadows, 
fractal to fractal. The telescope's eye 

fooled the eye. From there, does 
earth rise and set? Or a thrush, 
would it sing its trouble backward?--
the most private tremor first, then

the public part, famously 
melodic but fierce, really it's
fierce: stay   the fuck   away. I know
that lie, Sea of Tranquility.






Some dreamily smoke cigarettes, some track
 

Some dreamily smoke cigarettes, some track 
toddlers who walk like drunks. Buzzy,
the picnic grounds, noisy, sun-crazed, how 
forks and spoons don't exactly lie flat. 

A mountain's here, a famous overlook 
from which you'd see none of this. Like that 
first daguerreotype, its moving carriages 
and those who strolled never picked up 

in the long exposure, a Paris street emptied 
by the camera, only houses and lamp posts 
gone eternal. Or the one who stopped 
for a shoe shine, the one who knelt to the task. 

At the picnic--a commotion. A large man 
to a younger man. I don't know you! he's hugging 
and laughing. I don't know who you are, 
he shouts over and over a stillness so immense.





In a Beautiful Country
 

A good way to fall in love
is to turn off the headlights 
and drive very fast down dark roads.

Another way to fall in love
is to say they are only mints 
and swallow them with a strong drink.

Then it is autumn in the body.
Your hands are cold.
Then it is winter and we are still at war.

The gold-haired girl is singing into your ear
about how we live in a beautiful country.
Snow sifts from the clouds

into your drink. It doesn't matter about the war.
A good way to fall in love
is to close up the garage and turn the engine on,

then down you'll fall through lovely mists
as a body might fall early one morning 
from a high window into love. Love,

the broken glass. Love, the scissors
and the water basin. A good way to fall
is with a rope to catch you.

A good way is with something to drink
to help you march forward.
The gold-haired girl says, Don't worry

about the armies, says, We live in a time
full of love. You're thinking about this too much. 
Slow down. Nothing bad will happen.






Glass of Water Encounter
 

She dances only in her necklace,
scotch-lit surely. He touches his glasses.

Nightie-less, dugs whipping, hair sprung,
some music inside, out, wet tongue

tip at her lip, no mere palsied shuffle,
both bony feet lifted, elbows awful.

Shakespeare's banshee of wailing parts,
a woman with hair, a woman with warts.

He's fixed to the floor. Dear Heloise:
do other presumed-sane mothers do this--

wait in the dark after the ball
to strip for their sons at the end of the hall?

A dream, insists his sister
but his first wife knows better.





Human Lot
 

I'm amazed we haven't crawled off by now.
Later we could go back and cross things out,
that way we wouldn't know where we came from,
the shapes we asked to be bent into.
Sinatra'd be okay again,
mother the same distal approximation,
the sea still trying to spit it out.
Sometimes your sleep is different than mine.
I can't catch up.
I don't know--there are voices tangled outside.
Wind wants to make me correct something,
the refrigerator says something needs to be pushed
further from the sun.
Out where the sunset ends, they've installed a graveyard
and where it rises, some automatons bash together
mellifluous metal tubing
imparting a festive contusion
to the usual calm disaster of getting out of bed.
To find out why life has this glass sparkle
at the end of a dark hall.
To find out why the paper skeleton holds its hands
demurely over its crotch. Did it fall that way?
To find out how we fell.
There is a name to wake into and music to sleep through.
To find out where the blood comes from on the towels.
Old friends, I believe your betrayals were inadvertent.
To find out if my heart is unruined.
Father, are you out there
or was your corpse accurate?
Something happened to me when I was young
that I don't want to happen again
but I remember the first smell of ocean
when the family got out of the car in Jersey
to buy peaches. Spark thrust, spark dust.
The road was sand. 






To Those of You Alive in the Future
 

who somehow have found a sip of water,
on this day in the past four syndicated
series involving communication with the dead
were televised and in this way we resembled
our own ghosts in a world made brief with flowers.
To you, our agonies and tizzies
must appear quaint as the stiff shoulders
of someone carrying buckets from a well
or the stung beekeeper gathering honey.
Why did we bother hurrying from A to B
when we'd get no further than D, if that?
On Monday, it sleeted in Pennsylvania
while someone's mother was scoured further
from her own mind. A son-in-law smoked
in the parking lot, exhaling white curses
torn apart by the large invisible indifference.
The general anesthetic wore off
and someone else opened her eyes to the results.
In this way our world was broken and glued.
But why did we bother shooing away the flies?
Did we think we could work our way
inside a diamond if we ground more pigment
into the paper's tooth, tried to hold fire
on our tongues, sucked at the sugars of each other?
Many the engagement rings in the pawnshop.
Many the empties piled at the curbs.
A couple paused on a bridge to watch
chunks of ice tugged by bickering currents.
One who slept late reached out
for one who wasn't there. Breads, heavy
and sweet, were pulled from wide infernos
of stone ovens. My name was Dean Young,
I wrote it on a leaf. Sometimes
I could still manage to get lost,
there was no guidance system wired inside me yet.
Laughter might have come from a window
lit far into the night, others were dark
and always silent.






L Equals Look
 

At a book of details
Of all the moments when knowledge is acquired.

A sort of expanded balloon
Sighs and says, "We are what came before.

"The storm in the window of the mind,
The sleeping sister says while she's walking around

Wonderland watching
A cat touching down and talking.

Not a car in sight. A cemetery seen from the air.
All the obelisks you could ever ask for.






Today
 

Today a celebrity chimpanzee went postal,
tearing up a woman's face in Connecticut.
And as the Taliban were given the suburbs
of Swat in which to stone to death women
taken in adultery, a Muslim in New York 
whose radio station promoted Islam
as the most humane religion cut off 
his wife's head. Tomorrow, of course,
will be another day, but we live one day
at a time. Yesterday I uncovered the ribbon
snake in the woodpile, stiff and cold
in its winter sleep. A new urgency for spring:
I put the split log back and took my wood
from the farther end of the last stack.

What's with the chimp? I wondered,
driving between filthy snowbanks past stark 
trees like bony hands clawing up out
of the frozen earth to grab a gray heaven.
My wife thinks it's all that wireless buzz
hissing unbeknownst through everyone's
brains. I lean more toward toilet training. 

For sure, it began to go bad one unknown day
before history when the last man 
was browbeaten to step beyond a globe 
of golden firelight to drain his dragon 
in outer darkness. But we can't dwell 
in the past, can we? "To spring out on 
we call hereabouts the firewood we wade
through crusted snow to cut in March.
Someone just might have to wake up
early this year. But, then, let's just try 
to stay in the day, shall we?






Betrayal
 

It's now all about money 
about which poetry rarely reaches 
transcendence. But love must still fester 
even under that. Everyone I know
frets if poetry can still matter,
but what about love? It's all become
too much for them, and they're all 
on the soma. It makes sense 
with these pills when the someone
they thought they loved for years
by never thinking about it says, 
"I don't love you anymore,
but let's stay friends in that mellow
woebegone way poetry now 
sings without singing. Of course, 
they're always asking "What is poetry?
and then answering by saying 
it's what Boethius was thinking about
when they squished his head
until his eyes popped out, 
or anything barbaric enough to get
everyone to stop eating for a bit
and reach for a moment past 
a chatty moment. Sort of a solution 
to awkward goodbyes. How money 
becomes a sort of welcome 
relief that defuses the poetry 
charging tense moments. "Interesting,
someone remarks between bites, 
"to be right here in the moment
yet also out there watching 
some once-in-a-lifetime sublimity 
unfold, as if living as if already 
dead. As if standing in a dream far up 
in the stars somewhere with Scipio
and seeing how little love matters, 
or poetry for that matter, 
considering how glory endures 
only in glittering plunder. But best 
of all, all of it stays just sort of 
as if.






Fragments
 

An old man with a new hat
is running out of pride.
I want to tell the truth
but I don't know how.
The wind is our best pen
and it blows poetry out of the water.

I wait for days and weeks to enter
a feeling that's had years to leave.
The ocean keeps throwing questions
it has all the answers to.
A candle lights a room
and dims the stars.

When all that consoled consoles no longer
loneliness finds a room inside the one it knows.
I am shrinking from the light
and turning into space.
An old man with a new hat
wears his smile in the dark.





Meditation on a Grapefruit
 

To wake when all is possible
before the agitations of the day
have gripped you
                    To come to the kitchen
and peel a little basketball
for breakfast
              To tear the husk
like cotton padding        a cloud of oil
misting out of its pinprick pores
clean and sharp as pepper
                             To ease
each pale pink section out of its case
so carefully       without breaking
a single pearly cell 
                    To slide each piece
into a cold blue china bowl
the juice pooling       until the whole
fruit is divided from its skin
and only then to eat
                  so sweet
                            a discipline
precisely pointless       a devout
involvement of the hands and senses
a pause     a little emptiness

each year harder to live within
each year harder to live without





Blackbird Etude
 

For Craig
The blackbird sings at
the frontier of his music.
The branch where he sat

marks the brink of doubt,
is the outpost of his realm,
edge from which to rout

encroachers with trills
and melismatic runs sur-
passing earthbound skills.

It sounds like ardor,
it sounds like joy. We are glad
here at the border

where he signs the air
with his invisible staves,
"Trespassers beware--

Song as survival--
a kind of pure music which
we cannot rival.





Joy in the Woods
 

There is joy in the woods just now,
       The leaves are whispers of song,
And the birds make mirth on the bough
       And music the whole day long,
And God! to dwell in the town
       In these springlike summer days,
On my brow an unfading frown
       And hate in my heart always--

A machine out of gear, aye, tired,
Yet forced to go on--for I'm hired.

Just forced to go on through fear,
       For every day I must eat
And find ugly clothes to wear,
       And bad shoes to hurt my feet
And a shelter for work-drugged sleep!
       A mere drudge! but what can one do?
A man that's a man cannot weep!
       Suicide? A quitter? Oh, no!

But a slave should never grow tired,
Whom the masters have kindly hired.

But oh! for the woods, the flowers
       Of natural, sweet perfume,
The heartening, summer showers
       And the smiling shrubs in bloom,
Dust-free, dew-tinted at morn,
       The fresh and life-giving air,
The billowing waves of corn
       And the birds' notes rich and clear:--

For a man-machine toil-tired
May crave beauty too--though he's hired.





The Flash Reverses Time
 

DC Comics, November 1990, #44"Never Look Back, FlashYour Life Might Be Gaining On You

When I'm running across the city
on the crowded streets
to home, when, in a blur,
the grass turns brown
beneath my feet, the asphalt
steams under every step
and the maple leaves sway
on the branches in my wake,
and the people look,
look in that bewildered way,
in my direction, I imagine
walking slowly into my past
among them at a pace
at which we can look one another in the eye
and begin to make changes in the future
from our memories of the past--
the bottom of a bottomless well,
you may think, but why not dream a little:
our past doesn't contradict our future;
they're swatches of the same fabric
stretching across our minds,
one image sewn into another,
like the relationship between a foot and a boot, 
covariant in space and time--
one moves along with the other,
like an actor in a shadow play--
like a streak of scarlet light
across the skyline of your city
sweeping the debris, which is simply confetti,
candy wrappers, a can of soda,
all the experience of a day discarded
and now picked up
even down to the youthful screams of play
that put smiles on the faces of the adults
who hear remnants of their own voices
through a doorway leading back
to a sunrise they faintly remember.





"Que Sera Sera
 

In my car, driving through Black Mountain,
North Carolina, I listen to what
sounds like Doris Day shooting
heroin inside Sly Stone's throat.

One would think that she fights 
to get out, but she wants to stay
free in this skin. Fresh,
The Family Stone's album,

came out in '73, but I didn't make sense
of it till '76, sixth grade for me,
the Bicentennial, I got my first kiss that year,
I beat up the class bully; I was the man.

But for now, in my head, it's only '73
and I'm a little boy again, listening
to Sly and his Family covering Doris's hit,
driving down I-40;

a cop pulls me over to ask why
I'm here, in his town, with my Yankee tags.
I let him ask a series of questions
about what kind of work I do,

what brings me to town--you know
the kind of questions that tell you
this has nothing to do with driving a car.
My hands want to ball into fists.

But, instead, I tell myself to write a letter
to the Chief of Police, to give him something 
to laugh at over his morning paper,
as I try to recall the light in Doris Day's version

of "Que Sera Sera--without the wail
troubling the notes in the duet
of Sly and Cynthia's voices.
Hemingway meant to define
courage by the nonchalance you exude
while taking cover within your flesh,
even at the risk of losing
what some would call a melody;
I call it the sound of home.
Like when a song gets so far out
on a solo you almost don't recognize it,
but then you get back to the hook, you suddenly

recognize the tune and before you know it,
you're putting your hands together; you're on your feet--
because you recognize a sound, like a light,
leading you back home to a color:

rust. You must remember
rust--not too red, not too orange--not fire or overnight
change, but a simmering-summer
change in which children play till they tire

and grown folks sit till they grow edgy
or neighborhood dogs bite those not from your neigborhood
and someone with some sense says Down, Boy,
or you hope someone has some sense

who's outside or who owns the dog and then the sky
turns rust and the streetlights buzz on
and someone's mother, must be yours, says
You see those streetlights on don't you,

and then everybody else's mother comes out and says
the same thing and the sky is rust so you know
you got about ten minutes before she comes back out
and embarrasses you in front of your friends;

ten minutes to get home before you eat and watch
the Flip Wilson Show or Sanford and Son and it's time for bed.
And it's rust you need to remember
when the cop asks, What kind of work you do?

It's rust you need to remember: the smell
of summer rain on the sidewalk
and the patina on wrought-iron railings on your front porch
with rust patches on them, and the smell

of fresh mowed grass and gasoline and sweat
of your childhood as he takes a step back
when you tell him you're a poet teaching
English down the road at the college,

when he takes a step back--
to assure you, know, that this has nothing to do with race,
but the rust of a community he believes
he keeps safe, and he says Have a Good One,

meaning day as he swaggers back to his car,
and the color of the day and the face behind sunglasses
and the hands on his hips you'll always remember
come back gunmetal gray

for the rest of this rusty afternoon.
So you roll up the window
and turn the music back on,
and try to remember the rust caught in Sly's throat--

when the song came out in '73,
although I didn't get it till '76,
sixth grade for me, the Bicentennial;
I got my first kiss that year.

I beat up the class bully.
I was the man.





A quiet skin
 

Thinking has a quiet skin. But I feel the break and fled of things inside it.
    Blue hills most gentle in calm light, then stretches of assail
And ransack. Such tangles of charred wreckage, shrapnel-bits
    Singling and singeing where they fall. I feel the stumbling gait of what I am,
The quiet uproar of undone, how to be hidden is a tempting, violent thing--
    Each thought breaking always in another.

All the unlawful elsewheres rushing in.





No summer as yet
 

And no summer as yet, but it will come with its bright pieces of whatever,
    Sorted by the eye yet still uncaptured,
Greenly branched and various with promise. I'd like to watch it long enough,
    Held fast by the laws of its sequencings and shapings, and be so carried, the way the mind goes in
Search of an after that will temper what has come before,

Or sometimes not--: Did I tell you of the man I visited last week, who hasn't lost the ability
    To move his tongue, his lips, to laugh or cry or sing or use his voice, yet is unable
To utter any words, just a few unintelligible syllables,
    And recognizing this, stares into the fact of it
As at the eggs in an opened anthill? I don't know how to think of him. We are so rawly made,
    So carried into the harsh and almost-dark.

As if stung in the throat. As if seared by a narrow wire-like blaze
    Sharply upon the air and always.





The Things in Black Mens Closets
 

on the top shelf
of the closet
in the hat my father
wears on special occasions
it rests next to the large jar
he saves pennies in

his head is always bare
when i see him walking
in the street

i once sat in his bedroom
watching him search
between sweaters and suits
looking for something missing
a tie perhaps

then he stopped
and slowly walked to the closet
took the hat from the shelf

i sat on the bed
studying his back
waiting for him to turn
and tell me who died





Marathon
 

it's a strange time which finds me jogging
in early morning
the deadness of sleep alive in this world
the empty parks filled with unloved strangers
buildings grey with solitude
now near the end of another decade
i am witness to the loss of my twenties
a promise invisible
i run without purpose
far from the north star
i run with the sound of barking dogs closing in
i have lost count of the miles
i am older and nothing much matters 
or has changed





Mississippi
 

death surrounds itself with the living
i watch them take the body from the house
i'm a young kid maybe five years old
the whole thing makes no sense to me
i hear my father say
          lord jesus what she go and do this for
i watch him walk out the backdoor of the house
i watch him walk around the garden
kick the dirt
stare at the flowers
& shake his head  shake his head
he shakes his head all night long

yazoo
jackson
vicksburg
we must have family in almost every city
i spent more time traveling than growing up
guess that's why i'm still shorter than my old man
he don't like to stay in one place much
he tell me
soon as people get to know your last name
seem like they want to call you by your first
boy    if someone ask you your name
tell them to call you mississippi
not sippi or sip but mississippi

how many colored folks you know name mississippi

none see

now you can find a whole lot of folks whose
name is canada
just like you can find 53 people in any phone book
whose name is booker t. washington

your mother she was a smart woman
gave you a good name
not one of them abolitionist names

what you look like with a name like
john brown or william lloyd garrison
that don't have no class

your mother she named you after the river
cause of its beauty and mystery
just like my mother named me nevada
cause she didn't know where it was





Malcolm X, February 1965
 

i will die this month. how
i do not know. still there
is much work to be done. i 
am afraid not for myself but
for betty and the girls. some
nights i stay awake looking
out the window, a gun in my
hand. i know how cruel people
can be. i have known hatred and
blindness. there are brothers
waiting to do me harm. i will
die for them. i will love them
as only i can. may allah be my
witness.





Baldwin
 

you lie in bed listening,
waiting, fearing the moment
your father returns home. you
listen to voices talking in the
next room and wonder why you are
still afraid of the dark. his voice
in the other room you would love to
kiss. you cannot see your face in the
dark but the blackness is there, like
his back. if only he would
open the door and look at you. maybe
the light would be in his eyes,
his voice.





Port-Au-Prince
 

inside the car
franois and i
could see the light
coming from the
cigarette michele
duvalier was smoking
her husband
declared president
for life looked like
a fat chauffeur
sitting beind the
wheel

franois 
and i smiled

the small
procession of cars
slipping past us
in the dark

we did not know
that a few miles
away people were
already celebrating
nor could we see
joy on the faces
of the men who ran
holding knives and
sticks to the place
where papa doc
was buried
tonight even
ghosts will die
as franois and i
walk barefoot
at the center 
of port-au-prince

sometimes the deaf
hear better than the blind

heard her sing

were only attracted

Ode on Indolence
 

They toil not, neither do they spin.'
One morn before me were three figures seen, 
    With bowd necks, and joind hands, side-faced; 
And one behind the other stepp'd serene, 
    In placid sandals, and in white robes graced; 
        They pass'd, like figures on a marble urn, 
    When shifted round to see the other side; 
They came again; as when the urn once more 
        Is shifted round, the first seen shades return; 
    And they were strange to me, as may betide 
With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore.

How is it, Shadows! that I knew ye not? 
    How came ye muffled in so hush a mask? 
Was it a silent deep-disguisd plot 
    To steal away, and leave without a task 
        My idle days? Ripe was the drowsy hour; 
    The blissful cloud of summer-indolence 
Benumb'd my eyes; my pulse grew less and less; 
        Pain had no sting, and pleasure's wreath no flower: 
    O, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense 
Unhaunted quite of all but--nothingness?

A third time pass'd they by, and, passing, turn'd 
    Each one the face a moment whiles to me; 
Then faded, and to follow them I burn'd 
    And ached for wings, because I knew the three; 
        The first was a fair Maid, and Love her name; 
    The second was Ambition, pale of cheek, 
And ever watchful with fatigud eye; 
        The last, whom I love more, the more of blame 
    Is heap'd upon her, maiden most unmeek,-- 
I knew to be my demon Poesy.

They faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings: 
    O folly! What is Love? and where is it? 
And for that poor Ambition! it springs 
    From a man's little heart's short fever-fit; 
        For Poesy!--no,--she has not a joy,-- 
    At least for me,--so sweet as drowsy noons, 
And evenings steep'd in honey'd indolence; 
        O, for an age so shelter'd from annoy, 
    That I may never know how change the moons, 
Or hear the voice of busy common-sense!

 And once more came they by:--alas! wherefore? 
     My sleep had been embroider'd with dim dreams; 
 My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o'er 
     With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams: 
        The morn was clouded, but no shower fell, 
     Tho' in her lids hung the sweet tears of May; 
The open casement press'd a new-leaved vine, 
     Let in the budding warmth and throstle's lay; 
        O Shadows! 'twas a time to bid farewell! 
Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.

So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise 
    My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass; 
For I would not be dieted with praise, 
    A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce! 
        Fade softly from my eyes, and be once more 
    In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn; 
Farewell! I yet have visions for the night, 
    And for the day faint visions there is store; 
Vanish, ye Phantoms! from my idle spright, 
    Into the clouds, and never more return!





The Thorn
 

                              I
"There is a Thorn--it looks so old,
In truth, you'd find it hard to say
How it could ever have been young,
It looks so old and grey.
Not higher than a two years' child
It stands erect, this aged Thorn;
No leaves it has, no prickly points;
It is a mass of knotted joints,
A wretched thing forlorn.
It stands erect, and like a stone
With lichens is it overgrown.

                             II
"Like rock or stone, it is o'ergrown,
With lichens to the very top,
And hung with heavy tufts of moss,
A melancholy crop:
Up from the earth these mosses creep,
And this poor Thorn they clasp it round
So close, you'd say that they are bent
With plain and manifest intent
To drag it to the ground;
And all have joined in one endeavour
To bury this poor Thorn for ever.

                             III
"High on a mountain's highest ridge,
Where oft the stormy winter gale
Cuts like a scythe, while through the clouds
It sweeps from vale to vale;
Not five yards from the mountain path,
This Thorn you on your left espy;
And to the left, three yards beyond,
You see a little muddy pond
Of water--never dry,
Though but of compass small, and bare
To thirsty suns and parching air.

                             IV
"And, close beside this aged Thorn,
There is a fresh and lovely sight,
A beauteous heap, a hill of moss,
Just half a foot in height.
All lovely colours there you see,
All colours that were ever seen;
And mossy network too is there,
As if by hand of lady fair
The work had woven been;
And cups, the darlings of the eye,
So deep is their vermilion dye.

                              V
"Ah me! what lovely tints are there
Of olive green and scarlet bright,
In spikes, in branches, and in stars,
Green, red, and pearly white!
This heap of earth o'ergrown with moss,
Which close beside the Thorn you see,
So fresh in all its beauteous dyes,
Is like an infant's grave in size,
As like as like can be:
But never, never any where,
An infant's grave was half so fair.

                             VI
"Now would you see this aged Thorn,
This pond, and beauteous hill of moss,
You must take care and choose your time
The mountain when to cross.
For oft there sits between the heap,
So like an infant's grave in size,
And that same pond of which I spoke,
A Woman in a scarlet cloak,
And to herself she cries,
Oh misery! oh misery!
Oh woe is me! oh misery!'

                             VII
"At all times of the day and night
This wretched Woman thither goes;
And she is known to every star,
And every wind that blows;
And there, beside the Thorn, she sits
When the blue daylight's in the skies,
And when the whirlwind's on the hill,
Or frosty air is keen and still,
And to herself she cries,
Oh misery! oh misery!
Oh woe is me! oh misery!' 

                            VIII
"Now wherefore, thus, by day and night,
In rain, in tempest, and in snow,
Thus to the dreary mountain-top
Does this poor Woman go?
And why sits she beside the Thorn
When the blue daylight's in the sky
Or when the whirlwind's on the hill,
Or frosty air is keen and still,
And wherefore does she cry?--
O wherefore? wherefore? tell me why
Does she repeat that doleful cry?

                             IX
"I cannot tell; I wish I could;
For the true reason no one knows:
But would you gladly view the spot,
The spot to which she goes;
The hillock like an infant's grave,
The pond--and Thorn, so old and grey;
Pass by her door--'tis seldom shut--
And if you see her in her hut--
Then to the spot away!
I never heard of such as dare
Approach the spot when she is there.

                              X
"But wherefore to the mountain-top
Can this unhappy Woman go,
Whatever star is in the skies,
Whatever wind may blow?
"Full twenty years are past and gone
Since she (her name is Martha Ray)
Gave with a maiden's true good-will
Her company to Stephen Hill;
And she was blithe and gay,
While friends and kindred all approved
Of him whom tenderly she loved.

                             XI
"And they had fixed the wedding day,
The morning that must wed them both;
But Stephen to another Maid
Had sworn another oath;
And, with this other Maid, to church
Unthinking Stephen went-- 
Poor Martha! on that woeful day
A pang of pitiless dismay
Into her soul was sent;
A fire was kindled in her breast,
Which might not burn itself to rest.

                             XII
"They say, full six months after this,
While yet the summer leaves were green,
She to the mountain-top would go,
And there was often seen.
What could she seek?--or wish to hide?
Her state to any eye was plain;
She was with child, and she was mad;
Yet often was she sober sad
From her exceeding pain.
O guilty Father--would that death
Had saved him from that breach of faith!

                            XIII
"Sad case for such a brain to hold
Communion with a stirring child!
Sad case, as you may think, for one
Who had a brain so wild!
Last Christmas-eve we talked of this,
And grey-haired Wilfred of the glen
Held that the unborn infant wrought
About its mother's heart, and brought
Her senses back again:
And, when at last her time drew near,
Her looks were calm, her senses clear.

                             XIV
"More know I not, I wish I did,
And it should all be told to you;
For what became of this poor child
No mortal ever knew;
Nay--if a child to her was born
No earthly tongue could ever tell;
And if 'twas born alive or dead,
Far less could this with proof be said;
But some remember well,
That Martha Ray about this time
Would up the mountain often climb.

                             XV
"And all that winter, when at night
The wind blew from the mountain-peak,
'Twas worth your while, though in the dark,
The churchyard path to seek:
For many a time and oft were heard
Cries coming from the mountain head:
Some plainly living voices were;
And others, I've heard many swear,
Were voices of the dead:
I cannot think, whate'er they say,
They had to do with Martha Ray.

                             XVI
"But that she goes to this old Thorn,
The Thorn which I described to you,
And there sits in a scarlet cloak,
I will be sworn is true.
For one day with my telescope,
To view the ocean wide and bright,
When to this country first I came,
Ere I had heard of Martha's name,
I climbed the mountain's height:--
A storm came on, and I could see
No object higher than my knee.

                            XVII
" 'Twas mist and rain, and storm and rain:
No screen, no fence could I discover;
And then the wind! in sooth, it was
A wind full ten times over.
I looked around, I thought I saw
A jutting crag,--and off I ran,
Head-foremost, through the driving rain,
The shelter of the crag to gain;
And, as I am a man,
Instead of jutting crag, I found
A Woman seated on the ground.

                            XVIII
"I did not speak--I saw her face;
Her face!--it was enough for me;
I turned about and heard her cry,
Oh misery! oh misery!'
And there she sits, until the moon
Through half the clear blue sky will go;
And when the little breezes make
The waters of the pond to shake,
As all the country know,
She shudders, and you hear her cry,
Oh misery! oh misery!' 

                             XIX
"But what's the Thorn? and what the pond?
And what the hill of moss to her?
And what the creeping breeze that comes
The little pond to stir?
"I cannot tell; but some will say
She hanged her baby on the tree;
Some say she drowned it in the pond,
Which is a little step beyond:
But all and each agree,
The little Babe was buried there,
Beneath that hill of moss so fair.

                             XX
"I've heard, the moss is spotted red
With drops of that poor infant's blood;
But kill a new-born infant thus,
I do not think she could!
Some say, if to the pond you go,
And fix on it a steady view,
The shadow of a babe you trace,
A baby and a baby's face,
And that it looks at you;
Whene'er you look on it, 'tis plain
The baby looks at you again.

                             XXI
"And some had sworn an oath that she
Should be to public justice brought;
And for the little infant's bones
With spades they would have sought.
But instantly the hill of moss
Before their eyes began to stir!
And, for full fifty yards around,
The grass--it shook upon the ground!
Yet all do still aver
The little Babe lies buried there,
Beneath that hill of moss so fair.

                            XXII
"I cannot tell how this may be,
But plain it is the Thorn is bound
With heavy tufts of moss that strive
To drag it to the ground;
And this I know, full many a time,
When she was on the mountain high,
By day, and in the silent night,
When all the stars shone clear and bright,
That I have heard her cry,
Oh misery! oh misery!
Oh woe is me! oh misery!' 






Aubade
 

"Take me with you 
my mother says 
standing in her nightgown 
as, home from college, 
I prepare to leave 
before dawn. 
The desolation 
she must face 
was once my concern 
but like a bobber 
pulled beneath  
the surface 
by an inedible fish 
she vanished 
into the life 
he offered her. 
It stopped occurring 
to me she might return. 
"I'll be back I say 
and then I go.

Love and a Question
 

A Stranger came to the door at eve, 
   And he spoke the bridegroom fair. 
He bore a green-white stick in his hand, 
   And, for all burden, care. 
He asked with the eyes more than the lips 
   For a shelter for the night, 
And he turned and looked at the road afar 
   Without a window light. 

The bridegroom came forth into the porch 
   With, Let us look at the sky, 
And question what of the night to be, 
   Stranger, you and I.'
The woodbine leaves littered the yard, 
   The woodbine berries were blue, 
Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind; 
   Stranger, I wish I knew.'

Within, the bride in the dusk alone 
   Bent over the open fire, 
Her face rose-red with the glowing coal 
   And the thought of the heart's desire. 
The bridegroom looked at the weary road, 
   Yet saw but her within, 
And wished her heart in a case of gold 
   And pinned with a silver pin. 

The bridegroom thought it little to give 
   A dole of bread, a purse, 
A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God, 
   Or for the rich a curse; 
But whether or not a man was asked 
   To mar the love of two 
By harboring woe in the bridal house, 
   The bridegroom wished he knew.






Mowing
 

There was never a sound beside the wood but one,
And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.
What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,
Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound--
And that was why it whispered and did not speak.
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,
Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:
Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,
Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers
(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.
The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.





Isla
 

In Los Angeles I grew up watching The Three Stooges,
The Little Rascals, Speed Racer, and the Godzilla movies,

those my mother called "Los monstruos, and though I didn't
yet speak English, I understood why such a creature would,

upon being woken up from its centuries-long slumber, rise
and destroy Tokyo's buildings, cars, people--I understood

by the age of twelve what it meant to be unwanted, exiled,
how you move from one country to another where nobody

wants you, nobody knows you, and I sat in front of the TV,
transfixed by the snow-fizz on our old black and white,

and when Godzilla bellows his eardrum-crushing growl,
I screamed back, this victory-holler from one so rejected

and cursed to another. When the monster whipped its tail
and destroyed, I threw a pillow across my room; each time

my mother stormed into the room and asked me what,
what I thought I was doing throwing things at the walls.

"Ese monstruo, esa isla! she'd say. That monster, that island,
and I knew she wasn't talking about the movie. She meant

her country, mine, that island in the Caribbean we left behind,
itself a reptile-looking mass on each map, on my globe,

a crocodile-like creature rising again, eating us so completely.

                                                              --for Jarret Keene





Old Lem
 

I talked to old Lem
and old Lem said:
          "They weigh the cotton
          They store the corn

                To work the rows;

          To git out the county
          He didn't take it.
          He said Come and get me.'
          They came and got him
                       And they came by tens.
          He stayed in the county--
          He lays there dead.

                       They don't come by ones
                       They don't come by twos
                       But they come by tens.






Early Cinema
 

According to Mister Hedges, the custodian
who called upon their parents
after young Otwiner and young Julia
were spotted at the matinee
of Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik
at the segregated Knickerbocker Theater
in the uncommon Washington December
of 1922, "Your young ladies
were misrepresenting themselves today,
meaning, of course, that they were passing.
After coffee and no cake were finished
and Mister Hedges had buttoned his coat
against the strange evening chill,
choice words were had with Otwiner and Julia,
shame upon the family, shame upon the race.

How they'd longed to see Rudolph Valentino,
who was swarthy like a Negro, like the finest Negro man.
In The Sheik, they'd heard, he was turbaned,
whisked damsels away in a desert cloud.
They'd heard this from Lucille and Ella
who'd put on their fine frocks and French,
claiming to be "of foreign extraction
to sneak into the Knickerbocker Theater
past the usher who knew their parents
but did not know them.
They'd heard this from Mignon and Doris
who'd painted carmine bindis on their foreheads
braided their black hair tight down the back,
and huffed, "We'll have to take this up with the Embassy
to the squinting ticket taker.
Otwiner and Julia were tired of Oscar Michaux,
tired of church, tired of responsibility,
rectitude, posture, grooming, modulation,
tired of homilies each way they turned,
tired of colored right and wrong.
They wanted to be whisked away.

The morning after Mister Hedges' visit
the paperboy cried "Extra! and Papas
shrugged camel's hair topcoats over pressed pajamas,
and Mamas read aloud at the breakfast table,
"No Colored Killed When Roof Caves In
at the Knickerbocker Theater
at the evening show
from a surfeit of snow on the roof.
One hundred others dead.

It appeared that God had spoken.
There was no school that day,
no movies for months after.






Ars Poetica #100: I Believe
 

Poetry, I tell my students,
is idiosyncratic. Poetry

is where we are ourselves
(though Sterling Brown said

"Every I' is a dramatic I'),
digging in the clam flats

for the shell that snaps,
emptying the proverbial pocketbook.

Poetry is what you find
in the dirt in the corner,

overhear on the bus, God
in the details, the only way

to get from here to there.
Poetry (and now my voice is rising)

is not all love, love, love,
and I'm sorry the dog died.

Poetry (here I hear myself loudest)
is the human voice,

and are we not of interest to each other? 






Hole
 

One morning 
they dig up the sidewalk and leave.
No sign of the truck,
only the large,
dark shadow digging and digging,
piling up sludge with a hand shovel
beside the only tree.
Two o'clock I come by
and he's slumbering in the grass beside rat holes.
Three and he's stretched across a jagged stonewall,
folded hands tucked beneath one ear--
a beautiful young boy smiling,
not the heavy, large shadow who can't breathe.
Four-thirty and the August heat
takes one down here.
He's pulled up an elbow joint
some three feet round.
At seven I head home for the night,
pass the fresh gravel mound,
a soft footprint near the manhole
like the "x abuelo would place beside his name
all the years he couldn't write.






Visits to St. Elizabeths
 

This is the house of Bedlam.

This is the man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.

This is the time 
of the tragic man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.

This is a wristwatch
telling the time
of the talkative man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.

This is a sailor 
wearing the watch
that tells the time
of the honored man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.

This is the roadstead all of board
reached by the sailor
wearing the watch
that tells the time
of the old, brave man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.

These are the years and the walls of the ward,
the winds and clouds of the sea of board
sailed by the sailor
wearing the watch
that tells the time
of the cranky man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.

This is a Jew in a newspaper hat
that dances weeping down the ward
over the creaking sea of board
beyond the sailor
winding his watch
that tells the time
of the cruel man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.

This is a world of books gone flat.
This is a Jew in a newspaper hat
that dances weeping down the ward
over the creaking sea of board
of the batty sailor
that winds his watch
that tells the time
of the busy man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.

This is a boy that pats the floor
to see if the world is there, is flat,
for the widowed Jew in the newspaper hat
that dances weeping down the ward
waltzing the length of a weaving board
by the silent sailor
that hears his watch
that ticks the time
of the tedious man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.

These are the years and the walls and the door
that shut on a boy that pats the floor
to feel if the world is there and flat.
This is a Jew in a newspaper hat
that dances joyfully down the ward
into the parting seas of board
past the staring sailor
that shakes his watch
that tells the time
of the poet, the man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.

This is the soldier home from the war.
These are the years and the walls and the door
that shut on a boy that pats the floor
to see if the world is round or flat.
This is a Jew in a newspaper hat
that dances carefully down the ward,
walking the plank of a coffin board
with the crazy sailor
that shows his watch
that tells the time
of the wretched man
that lies in the house of Bedlam.





The Fifth Fact
 

For Ben's project he must research five facts
about his African-American hero and write them 
on posterboard. He chooses Harriet Tubman,
whose five facts are: Her father's name was Ben.
Her mother's name was Old Rit. She was born
in 1820 and died in 1913. She was born in Maryland
and died in New York. Ben asks for advice
about his fifth fact and I suggest: She led more than
300 people to freedom. Ben sighs the way he does
now and says, Everyone knows that, Mom.

So I try to remember the book we read yesterday,
search for the perfect fact, the one that will match
his four facts and satisfy his almost-seven mind.
Remember, I ask, she was a spy for the North 
during the Civil War? It's a hit! He writes it:
Harriet Tubman was a spy for the north during 
the civil war. It was a war between the north
which is where the slaves were trying to get
and the south which is where they were.
Before the war, Abraham Lincoln signed a form
that said All the slaves everywhere are free!
which is one of the reasons they were fighting.

On summer mornings, Lincoln rode his horse
to work down the Seventh Street Turnpike 
close to my new home. Down Georgia Avenue
past The Hunger Stopper and Pay Day 2 Go and liquor
stores and liquor stores. Past Cluck-U-Chicken
and Fish in the 'Hood and Top Twins Faze II 
Authentic African Cuisine and the newish Metro station
and all those possibilities gleaming in developers' eyes.

There goes Lincoln's horse down Georgia Avenue
from the Soldier's Home to the White House 
much cooler up here in the country, in the neighborhood,
at the hospital. And there's Walt Whitman, the sworn poet
of every dauntless rebel the world over, hanging around
his street corner every morning to bow to the president 
at Thomas Circle by the homeless guys. It's 100 years now 
since any president summered at the Soldier's Home. 
But I was born only 50 years after Harriet Tubman died, 
all these centuries we drag into the next century and the next. 

And sometimes I see the ghosts of Harriet Tubman 
and Lincoln and Uncle Walt and the true stories 
and sometimes our own despair like Washington's 
summer malaria, her 40 war hospitals, Whitman moving 
from bed to bed, stroking the hair of so many dying boys.

Head north up Georgia Avenue now to our own 
soldiers' home  Walter Reed  where the boys and now 
girls too mourn the ghosts of their own legs and arms
and capacity for love. Where is their sworn poet? 
I write here in my new neighborhood, the city old
and new around me, Harriet Tubman born so close,
all these heroes under our feet.






Snookie Johnson Goes Down to the Recruiters Office Near Benning Road & Starts Some Shit
 

it was right about the time they started drafting for the iraqi war
snookie came to sign up but he didn't walk through the door,

instead he leaped like a madman right through the plate glass
& kicked the recruiting sergeant square in his no-good ass

he said, "i wanna go to the desert, kill some arab chump
& drink his hot blood like water from a barnyard pump

i wanna get bit on my nose by a scorpion wit a bad attitude
i wanna smoke twelve packs a day & eat snake heart for food

i wanna drink poison gas with a side order of sand
& dance with a nuclear missile while digging the junkyard band

i wanna jump in an oil well & get real slick
then have me a party with some them mooslim chicks

cause i'm snookie johnson from a bad neighborhood
& when i get ciced up i don't mean nobody good

so sign me up sergeant & sign me up fast
i'm just raring to kick me some motherfuckin ass

the sergeant looked at snookie with nothing but disgust
knowing he was the kind of nigga can't nobody trust

"you too damn crazy for the military, the sarge said wit a frown
snookie gave him a sheet of paper & said, "yo man, write dat down.






No Images
 

She does not know
her beauty,
she thinks her brown body
has no glory.

If she could dance
naked
under palm trees
and see her image in the river,
she would know.

But there are no palm trees
on the street,
and dish water gives back 
no images.






Take Me Out to the Go-Go
 

Nikita zips across stage
Trailed by a troop of white-gloved
One-wheelers: Killer Joes, 
The 12 & Under Crew
In disguise. 

A sixth sense guides him
Beyond darkness. An 
Inner voice says when,
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop,
I'll tell you when. 

A constellation of funeral homes. 
Jumpsuits. Red & white
Ribbons in the sky. The total 
Groove, a carnival of roses
Circling the moon. 

Mere call & response
Never knocked socks this way,
Lifting nicknames & dates
From the faces of tombstones
And mere call & response never will. 

God climbs inside, 
Asking for souls--
Something we weren't taught to share.





The Gift Outright
 

The land was ours before we were the land's.
She was our land more than a hundred years
Before we were her people. She was ours
In Massachusetts, in Virginia,
But we were England's, still colonials,
Possessing what we still were unpossessed by,
Possessed by what we now no more possessed.
Something we were withholding made us weak
Until we found out that it was ourselves
We were withholding from our land of living,
And forthwith found salvation in surrender.
Such as we were we gave ourselves outright
(The deed of gift was many deeds of war)
To the land vaguely realizing westward,
But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced,
Such as she was, such as she would become.






American Wedding
 

In america,
I place my ring 
on your cock 
where it belongs.
No horsemen 
bearing terror, 
no soldiers of doom
will swoop in 
and sweep us apart.
They're too busy 
looting the land 
to watch us.
They don't know 
we need each other 
critically.
They expect us to call in sick, 
watch television all night,
die by our own hands. 
They don't know 
we are becoming powerful. 
Every time we kiss 
we confirm the new world coming.

What the rose whispers
before blooming
I vow to you.
I give you my heart, 
a safe house. 
I give you promises other than
milk, honey, liberty.
I assume you will always
be a free man with a dream.
In america,
place your ring
on my cock 
where it belongs.
Long may we live
to free this dream.






Common Dust
 

And who shall separate the dust 
What later we shall be: 
Whose keen discerning eye will scan 
And solve the mystery?

The high, the low, the rich, the poor, 
The black, the white, the red, 
And all the chromatique between, 
Of whom shall it be said:

Here lies the dust of Africa; 
Here are the sons of Rome; 
Here lies the one unlabelled, 
The world at large his home!

Can one then separate the dust? 
Will mankind lie apart, 
When life has settled back again 
The same as from the start?






July in Washington
 

The stiff spokes of this wheel
touch the sore spots of the earth.

On the Potomac, swan-white
power launches keep breasting the sulphurous wave.

Otters slide and dive and slick back their hair,
raccoons clean their meat in the creek.

On the circles, green statues ride like South American
liberators above the breeding vegetation--

prongs and spearheads of some equatorial
backland that will inherit the globe.

The elect, the elected . . . they come here bright as dimes,
and die dishevelled and soft.

We cannot name their names, or number their dates--
circle on circle, like rings on a tree--

but we wish the river had another shore,
some further range of delectable mountains,

distant hills powdered blue as a girl's eyelid.
It seems the least little shove would land us there,

that only the slightest repugnance of our bodies
we no longer control could drag us back.





Why Is It Greek Omelet and Not Puerto Rican?
 

Every morning
I look for you
on the menu.

Where are
your eyes and lips,
my side order of thighs?

I'm so hungry for the
sauce of you and the
way your blouse opens

like a flame.






At the Air and Space Museum
 

When I was
nearly six my

father
opened his magic

doctor bag:
two

tongue depressors fastened by
a rubber

band;
one flick

of his hairy wrist
and lo!

we invented
flight.





Holocaust Museum
 

We filed through the exhibits,
Charlotte and I taking turns
reading captions to Andy.
Herded into a freight elevator,
we rode to the top floor,
to the beginning of the War

where we were on our own,
descending floor by floor, 
year by year, into history
growing darker, ceilings
lowering, aisles narrowing
to tunnels like the progress

of Andy's vision over the years. 
In Warsaw, his family owned
Maximillian's Fur Salon
like a little Bergdorf Goodman's,
doorman and French elevator, 
furs draped on the Persian carpet,

over the blue velvet Empire chairs.
Andy was one of the lucky ones, 
a Jewish boy escaping Poland
the day before the border closed; 
playing card games with his cousin
in the backseat of the family Packard

as they inched through peasant villages,
trading mink coats for gasoline.
If his German shepherd guide dog,
Topper, isn't there, it's hard to tell
that Andy is blind, Andy's blue eyes
look normal, and he stares

directly at you when you speak. 
His bearded face, grave, listening,
as Charlotte and I stood to the side
describing photographs or reading
softly, quickly, in monotones, 
so as not to attract attention,

casually, as if reading selections
from a menu. Guards warned us
that there were so many things to see--
thousands of bits of information,
photographs, newsreels, movies--
it would take us days to read it all.

That morning, I had dressed
in a black sweater and black pants,
black coat and black boots, 
and Charlotte and Andy had, too,
mourners attending a mass funeral.
I knew that, eventually,

something had to break me down--
the cattle car, the crematorium door, 
the confiscated valises of Jews
piled high and dramatically lit
as in a department store display,
or the room filled with nothing

but shoes--mountains of shoes--
each shoe still shaped to the human
foot it had once belonged to, 
a man's shoe, a woman's shoe, 
a left or a right shoe, its mate
lost in a pile somewhere;

dusty, scuffed boots and pumps,
heels worn down to the shank,
shoes that appeared to have walked
miles and miles to arrive here.
The odd thing was--
the room smelled like feet.

I managed not to cry.
Until a small snapshot of a girl
shot dead, lying beside her family
on a cobbled street--her hair
as long as my eight-year-old's, 
her coat, my daughter's size--

stopped my words, and by then
Charlotte had started crying
and Andy was crying, too.
I didn't ask what had triggered 
each private grief. 
When I couldn't read, Charlotte

would continue mid-sentence,
when she choked up and had to stop,
I stepped in. We started developing
a rhythm, Andy's hand placed
on Charlotte's or my arm to guide him
through room after room of empty air. 

Around us, weeping strangers
detoured around our little group
moving far too slow for them;
and as they passed they stared
openly at Andy
knowing he couldn't stare back,

but they smiled at Topper straining
against his leash and metal harness,
they chuckled when Topper flopped
down sighing and nodding off
in the dark at Andy's feet
each time we stopped to read. 

A woman asked permission to pet him. 
After those nightmare photographs
of snarling, muzzled, killer dogs,
what a relief to see
an ordinary one,
and something that wasn't human.

Three o'clock. We were starved,
but nobody felt like eating.
Charlotte and I went to the ladies room
leaving Topper and Andy in the lobby
by the cloakroom, near a black family
putting on their coats. 

The husband wanted to pet Topper,
and struck up a conversation 
with Andy. "I see you're blind,
he said politely. "Do you understand this
any better than I do? And Andy
shook his head and told him no. 






Groovin Low
 

my swing is more mellow
these days: not the hardbop drive
i used to roll but more of a cool
foxtrot. my eyes still close
when the rhythm locks; i've learned
to boogie with my feet on the floor
i'm still movin', still groovin'
still fallin' in love

i bop to the bass line now. the trap set
paradiddles ratamacues & flams
that used to spin me in place still set me 
off, but i bop to the bass line now
i enter the tune from the bottom up
& let trumpet & sax wheel above me

so don't look for me in the treble
don't look for me in the fly
staccato splatter of the hot young horn
no, you'll find me in the nuance
hanging out in inflection & slur
i'm the one executing the half-bent
dip in the slow slowdrag
with the smug little smile
& the really cool shades





The Wound-Dresser
 

1

An old man bending I come among new faces,
Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,
Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,
(Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war,
But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd myself,
To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)
Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,
Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave;)
Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,
Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?
What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,
Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?


2

O maidens and young men I love and that love me,
What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls,
Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and dust,
In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the rush of successful charge,
Enter the captur'd works--yet lo, like a swift running river they fade,
Pass and are gone they fade--I dwell not on soldiers' perils or soldiers' joys,
(Both I remember well--many of the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content.)

But in silence, in dreams' projections,
While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,
So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,
With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up there,
Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)

Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,
Straight and swift to my wounded I go,
Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,
Where their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground,
Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital,
To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,
To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,
An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,
Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill'd again.

I onward go, I stop,
With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,
I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,
One turns to me his appealing eyes--poor boy! I never knew you,
Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that would save you.


3

On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)
The crush'd head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away,)
The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through I examine,
Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life struggles hard,
(Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!
In mercy come quickly.)

From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,
I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood,
Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and side falling head,
His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the bloody stump,
And has not yet look'd on it.

I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,
But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,
And the yellow-blue countenance see.

I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,
Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so offensive,
While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.
 
I am faithful, I do not give out,
The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,
These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast a fire, a burning flame.)


4

Thus in silence in dreams' projections,
Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,
The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,
I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,
Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,
(Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and rested,
Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)






1926
 

The porchlight coming on again,
Early November, the dead leaves
Raked in piles, the wicker swing
Creaking. Across the lots
A phonograph is playing Ja-Da.

An orange moon. I see the lives
Of neighbors, mapped and marred
Like all the wars ahead, and R.
Insane, B. with his throat cut,
Fifteen years from now, in Omaha.

I did not know them then.
My airedale scratches at the door.
And I am back from seeing Milton Sills
And Doris Kenyon. Twelve years old.
The porchlight coming on again.





Lands End
 

A day all blue and white, and we
Came out of woods to sand
And snow-capped waves. The sea
Rose with us as we walked, the land
Built dunes, a lighthouse, and a sky of gulls.

Here where I built my life ten years ago,
The day breaks gray and cold;
And brown surf, muddying the shore,
Deposits fish-heads, sewage, rusted tin.
Children and men break bottles on the stones.
Beyond the lighthouse, black against the sky,
Two gulls are circling where the woods begin.





A Late History
 

To Herbert Cahoon
1.
Black, under the candlesticks, moving in harness
To a slow music, we hang the sepulchre
And hear the herald angels sing, "He is not here.
It is mid-November. The first snows
Have fallen silently over the town. I eat
Black pudding at the altar while a dove
Descends from the flaming tower. Later,
Dr. Rashdall, behind whose scholarship
A generation's knowledge burns, will unmask
Newman. But now it is mid-November.
I eat black pudding and the dove descends.

2.
In a hollow tree by the bridge, an owl awaits.
The moon is full and white. The stars are out.
Tall elms surround the statue of a nymph
Where old Etonians, festive in Norfolk jackets,
Commemorate D. G. Rossetti with a plaque.
I relish the scene, remembering old Watts-Dunton
Boasting, "Dogs have never bitten me! that day
We talked about Rossetti. Later, attacks of gout,
That horrible baby that looked like Gosse, a wheelchair
Wobbling on toward Trinity, webs covering my eyes.
But tonight the moon is full, and white. Thus 1904 begins.

 3.
 Of the far end of Marseilles and the islands: 
 A dwarf climbing where the waves are luminous
 With phosphorescent lights, where foam bursts into flower,
 And the slow rise and fall of the ocean
 Rocks the world. Moving like a crab over the sand,
 He murmurs, "We can never praise the beauty of 
 The world enough, my friend. Later, death by starvation;
 Until the end, swinging on a trapeze for an hour
 Every day, longing to be tall.  He left
 Some wonderful paintings. I walk beside him now
 At the far end of Marseilles, toward the islands.
  
 4.
 Now, now, if ever, love opening your eyes,
 The great blind windows lifted toward the sun, the doors
 Thrown open wide.  I said to my heart, 
 Do I wake or sleep?--Soon, soon, these closings start
 Where mornings held the garden captive; and early dusk,
 Laden with mist and smoke, drift upward from the grass.
 The wind dies. The scraping leaves are still. I said to my heart,
 Ravaged by darkness, "Now, Soon, and Later have become 
 Each other--doors all closed, the windows blocked and barred for good--
 All and sink down together to the bottom of the sea.
 Do I wake or sleep? It is late tonight as it will ever be.








The Beach in August
 

The day the fat woman
In the bright blue bathing suit
Walked into the water and died,
I thought about the human
Condition. Pieces of old fruit
Came in and were left by the tide.

What I thought about the human
Condition was this: old fruit
Comes in and is left, and dries
In the sun. Another fat woman
In a dull green bathing suit
Dives into the water and dies.
The pulmotors glisten. It is noon.

We dry and die in the sun
While the seascape arranges old fruit,
Coming in and the tide, glistening
At noon. A woman, moderately stout,
In a nondescript bathing suit,
Swims to a pier. A tall woman
Steps toward the sea. One thinks about the human
Condition. The tide goes in and goes out.





The Paleontologists Blind Date
 

You have such lovely bones, he says,
holding my face in his hands, 
 
and although I can almost feel
the stone and the sand 
 
sifting away, his fingers
like the softest of brushes, 
 
I realize after this touch
he would know me 
 
years from now, even
in the dark, even 
 
without my skin.
Thank you, I smile-- 
 
then I close the door
and never call him again.





Sweet Romanian Tongue
 

Drew down the curse of heaven on her umbrella
furled and smelling of wet cigarettes,
Jo ran off in rain one pitchy night,
one bloody a.m. found her staring, snoring.

"Why do we all stay up so late? Jo queried.
"Though I don't stay up so late as my friends.
She tripped the little bomb of wasps.
They got her.

Tears for Jo, four, each perfect, waspish.
A silver tongue and piss-blond hair
decants a funeral oblation for the mouse.
"She was a rare sight, a winning wonder.
Jo cultivates her toothaches elsewhere.





Light Night
 

1

A tree, enamel needles, 
owl takeoffs shake,
flapping a sound and smell
of underwing, like flags,
the clothy weight of flags.
A cone of silence stuck
with diamonds, the watch
she hunts, the frayed band
broke. It was a black night.
Dawn walked on it, the sun
set its heel. She won't
find: a boundary of marsh,
the island in the wood.

               2

Stoop, dove, horrid maid,
spread your chiffon on our
wood rot breeding the
Destroying Angel, white,
lathe-shapely, trout-lily
lovely. Taste, and have it.

               3

In a rain-dusk dawn, the
clearing edge, the wood's
fangs, the clear crystal
twist of a salival stream,
announce you hence. Tear
free of me, mountain, old
home bone, down sheer fear
tears mossed boulders
bound me, pool, deceptive,
trout-full, laugh and
chatter of finch and pecker,
gargle my liquor skin I
catch your face on. Scar
a look and leave. A rust
plush daycoach unfathers
me. A field of crosses. Let
iron clang iron.

Unnumbered Ward
 

And accustomed ungentle hands of two blue-uniformed attendants
wrap the patient in suffering's white bed gown
sewn with bright invisible emblems of virtues,
or pinned with them, as with fraternity pins, or mosaic pins,
meaning travel. Has he always only just arrived?
Really suffering, within and without his head
burn hot wires of pain: "I cannot bear this: and does,
and does the time and place outwardly expound
what is within? To be well, to wear new clothes,
to decimate his wage for a necktie, a scarf or gloves, love
"your magic spell scabbed his fevered lips, lay
no cold cloths, though to be him bent on him
eyes of those called to selflessness, lonely for more selfish days.






Foreign Parts
 

Meat-eater, salt-licker, piped spring
dribble-sucker, an exiled Bolshevik's

villa at Viareggio. The beach sheep
shit crumby money, munificent marks,

lire, dollars, Dolorous Daintyfoot,
Proudass, Chinadoll, a three-way clut-

ter, the piazza pizzeria. Mrs. Smith-
Jones, rich, gonged aground a pissoir.

At three the imprisoned poisoner's tea
tells her rice-cake fortune, it is it.

Who to who? You yew alley ewes knew
goatsuckers in Swedish horse-hide hid

the boathouse key, locked the oarlock,
sung Sam's nutsy song, Sin Fleet, at

night. Night, ketchup cup, pepper-pot,
bid bound Belinda break her bracelets:

the dirty photographs apostrophize mon-
soons. Swimming snakes shake the lake.






Destitute Peru
 

For John Ashbery
We pullmaned to Peoria. Was
Gladys glad, Skippy missed
Sookie so. So Peru-ward, home.
"I'll sew buttons on dresses yet.

Nike's peach-knife nicked little
finger Chinese straw finger-cuffed
to Minna's Siamesed. Hartford,
how are your wheres, our whens?

Or extirpated traumas' gifted
guilt smothered aboard a club
car. Lake Ontario spilled
Jo Jo's knapsack: "Pasternak.

An alligator ate an alligator-
trapping monkey. We ate because
"it's dark, it's air-conditioned
like lurching to the movies,

shot marbles in lobbies. What
interests? Takes? Escapes? Eat,
moth-light, part and apart, slowly
we slow waiters serve hot plates.






Tears, Oily Tears . . .
 

Crying is a habit with me.
You mustn't mind: onions make me
smog
headlines in the Daily News,
not getting enough sleep
going to the movies and not going.
Fear of getting bawled out by people shorter than me,
animals in zoos,
deserted buses late at night,
teargas, hunger, frustration
sob
and, oh, yes,
superfluous lines of verse and great beauty
move me to tears,
sliding out of me like oil
out of an over-oiled electric fan






Address
 

Right hand graced with writing,
my left arm my secondhand new
suit bestrode, from the auto I
say, "Antinous, perched like a
parakeet cracking sunflower seeds
in a hot ice cave or cage,
you're an apogee. Acid pennies
will fill your mouth, your head
bowl at a soldiers' revel. Fly
the safety you despise and seek,
a butcher with a butcher's knife
peers. The lice are fast. Ta ta.






Poem (The day gets slowly started)
 

The day gets slowly started.
A rap at the bedroom door,
bitter coffee, hot cereal, juice
the color of sun which
isn't out this morning. A
cool shower, a shave, soothing
Noxzema for razor burn. A bed
is made. The paper doesn't come
until twelve or one. A gray shine
out the windows. "No one
leaves the building until
those scissors are returned.
It's that kind of a place.
Nonetheless, I've seen worse.
The worried gray is melting
into sunlight. I wish I'd
brought my book of enlightening
literary essays. I wish it
were lunch time. I wish I had
an appetite. The day agrees
with me better than it did, or,
better, I agree with it. I'll
slide down a sunslip yet, this
crass September morning.





They Are Human After All
 

They are human after all, you think,
as the waiter steps up to a table
out of sight of you,
reserved, corner table--
they too are thin-skinned and pleasure-seeking,
with their own feelings and their own sufferings.

You're not so all alone
in your mess, your restlessness, your shakes,
they too will be full of doubt, dither, shilly-shallying, 
even if it's all about making deals,
the universal-human
albeit in its commercial manifestations,
but present there too.

Truly, the grief of hearts is ubiquitous 
and unending,
but whether they were ever in love
(outwith the awful wedded bed)
burning, athirst, desert-parched
for the nectar of a faraway 
mouth,
sinking, drowning
in the impossibility of a union of souls--

you won't know, nor can you
ask the waiter,
who's just ringing up
another bock,
always avid for coupons
to quench a thirst of another nature,
though also deep.





The Young Hebbel
 

You carve and sculpt, the deft chisel
in a soft shapely hand.
I beat my head against the marble
to knock it into shape,
my hands work for a living. 

I am still a long way from myself,
but I want to become Me!
There is someone deep in my blood
who cries out for homemade
Olympuses and worlds for humans.

My mother is such a poor wretch,
you'd laugh if you saw her,
we live in a tight annex,
built onto the end of the village.

My youth is like a scab:
under it there is a wound
that every day leaks blood.
It disfigures me.

I don't need sleep,
food just enough to keep from starving.
An implacable struggle
and the world bristling with sword points.
Each one hungers for my heart.
Each one, I, unarmed,
must melt in my blood. 





Jena
 

"Jena before us in the lovely valley
thus my mother on a postcard
from a walking holiday on the banks of the Saale,
she was spending a week at the spa of Kosen;
long forgotten now, the ancestor no more,
her script a subject for graphology,
years of becoming, years of illusion,
only those words I'll never forget.

It wasn't a great picture, no class,
there was not enough blossom
to justify lovely, poor paper, no pulp-free mass,
also the hills weren't green with vineyards,
but she was from back-country hovels,
so the valleys probably did strike her as lovely,
she didn't need laid paper or four-color print,
she supposed others would see what she had seen.

It was something said at a venture,
an exaltation had prompted it,
the landscape had moved her,
so she asked the waiter for a postcard,
and yet--vide supra--the ancestor went on,
as will we all, including even those--
years of becoming, years of illusion--
who see the town in the valley today.





Static Poems
 

Deafness to imperatives
is profundity in the wise man,
children and grandchildren
don't bother him,
don't alarm him.

To represent a particular outlook,
to act,
to travel hither and yon
are all signs of a world
that doesn't see clearly.
In front of my window
--wise man says--
is a valley
where shadows pool,
two poplars mark a path,
leading you will know where to.

Perspective
is another word for stasis:
you draw lines,
they ramify
like a creeper--
tendrils explode--
and they disburse crows in swarms
in the winter red of early dawns

then let them settle--

you will know--for whom.





Gladioli
 

A bunch of glads,
certainly highly emblematic of creation,
remote from frills of working blossom with hope of fruit:
slow, durable, placid,
generous, sure of kingly dreams.

All else is natural world and intellect!
Over there the mutton herds:
strenuous ends of clover and daggy sheep--
here friendly talents,
pushing Anna to the center of attention,
explaining her, finding a solution!

The glads offer no solution:
being--falling--
you mustn't count the days--
fulfillment
livid, tattered, or beautiful.





from "Late
 

Feel it--but remember, millennia have felt it--
the sea and the beasts and the mindless stars
wrestle it down today as ever--

think it--but remember, the most exalted
are wallowing in their own bow-wave,
are no more than the yellow of the buttercup,
while other colors too play their game--

remember and endure the hour,
there was never one like it, all are like it,
people and angels and cherubim,
black-winged, bright-eyed,
none was yours--
was ever yours.





Finis Poloniae
 

Finis Poloniae--
a phrase/figure of speech,
that apart from its literal historical meaning
stands in for
the end of empires.

Charged atmosphere,
everything breathes damply,
epicene air--if it could think anything
it would think un-European things like monsoons
and yellow seas.

Greatness bears itself to death,
says its last words to itself,
a foreign-sounding swansong, generally misunderstood,
sometimes tolerated--

Finis Poloniae--
perhaps on a rainy day, bummer, 
but in this instance a sound of happiness
followed by solo horn,
and then a hydrangea, most placid of flowers,
capable of standing out in the rain into November,
dropped softly into the grave.





Whats Bad
 

Not reading English,
and hearing about a new English thriller
that hasn't been translated.

Seeing a cold beer when it's hot out,
and not being able to afford it.

Having an idea
that you can't encapsulate in a line of Hlderlin,
the way the professors do.

Hearing the waves beat against the shore on holiday at night,
and telling yourself it's what they always do.

Very bad: being invited out,
when your own room at home is quieter,
the coffee is better,
and you don't have to make small talk.

And worst of all:
not to die in summer,
when the days are long
and the earth yields easily to the spade.





"Zeh was a pharmacist
 

Zeh was a pharmacist,
or claimed to be,
times were tranquil, people didn't ask too many questions,
but when a new broom came along, it was duly "established that etc.
and it all contributed to his downfall.

Zeh was an incomparable magician
shelves full of powders and tinctures
not that he had to sell them to you
you were persuaded of their efficacy
in advance.

Zeh had mixed up a slimming-cure
called Zeean that you hardly even needed to take
it worked in your pocket
you straightaway started to reduce.
He had stuck that preparation
       in one of the pharmacy windows.

Among other things you could see there
herbal teas, pestles and mortars, chatty tips
for di- and nocturnal events of an untoward nature
all of it defying description--
unrivaled in their suggestiveness
from a psychosomatic point of view

his like would never be found again
children (not likely!) desunt,
long since turfed out of his grave. 






Plumblossom
 

The spine is a slide of human marvels; it is a hierarchy of white florets; it is a cult of secret brothers; it is a deliberate list; so look how the spineless relax in their unblushing banality. I lose my patience in Greensboro where no discoveries are ever made and the only inner lavishment is the bar, occasionally. The spineless aspire to incessant interludes that never arrive anywhere and that can't remember wherefrom they came. Mary is slightly spineless, for instance: her dress is cream her skin is cream her creamy mind is fine and her life will end finely--how sad is that to think of, the finery of a cream life? It is the saddest of all truths that can be read on a person's face in a decorous garden that person has planted themselves and of which they are explaining to you the intricacies and expense: "notice how in the light; "three pallets shipped last week; "have complementary attitudes when it comes to soil-type and moisture. She isn't wicked; but, also, she destroys the art of her life.





Plumblossom
 

Out here in the desert, everything is one thing: the desert. What god but the One God, exotic in his reachless amount casting love over our encampment beside the nervy water of Jordan? John, you have a little gristle when you speak and what's left of you is the scrape of a year starved on grasshoppers. It is touching to see the basin of your devoted body. A little bit east, whole lambs were smeared on the temple. The city was coiled, white within its walls (violet), its muscles twisting over muscles. The temple, sleek at the top, smiled with music--it might've lifted for a second.I was just there. The priests wore such tall hats, heavenly bodies dropped behind their eyes. The mothers of Jerusalem suggested curtains tattering down from the markets that whirred with the songs of bargaining, parting one from the other, laughing home.The dust lifted into the hair of the peaceful citizens and was shaken out. The land was socializing. The invalids were blind as stars; the children plaited their hair in a manner pleasing to mountain lions: the boys; the trumpets bellowed like lonely bulls--they were distressed, despite their red velvet dresses; the widows were wrapping themselves in silk as their sons carried nearby stones outside the city; mules were begging to be beaten with softer sticks; a yellowing vine was making love to a young tree; grape skins were staining the feet of dancers; merchant's fingers became little bodies which wrapped themselves around each coin; cups of hot tea startled the mouths of the idle; a tangle of serpents tried to choose just one mate; the lit membrane of a sheet hung in a window to dry, itself a heavenly body. I could go on, John, but why leave the sheet? What sermon on hope or virtue can you make that is more convincing than it?Leaving the city was a wrenching kind of death, but lying here by you, John, in rocks and flat dirt--Heaven is unexpected. 





Spring
 

Mother tried to take her life. 
The icicles thawed. 
The house, a wet coat 
we couldn't put back on. 

Still, the garden quickened, 
the fields were firm. 
Birds flew from the woods'
fingertips. Among the petals 

and sticks and browning fruit, 
we sat in the grass and 
bickered, chained daisies, prayed. 
All that falls is caught. Unless 

it doesn't stop, like moonlight,
which has no pace to speak of,
falling through the cedar limbs,
falling through the rock. 





Dress Rehearsal
 

Branches etch the film of ice
on the studio window. A crow looks in,
hopping and shrieking when I dance
in my black tutu, trimmed with silver. 

The ballet master says, you are its mother.
But in a crow's sky-knowing mind
could I be so misconstrued? 
Out of the blackest

cold-wet air, the crow seems molded. 
The stars will not wake up to guide it 
back to the creek of shadows
where it was formed. Practice, practice. 

I am smoke in darkness, climbing away
from a burning hut, in an otherwise empty field
on which the fire is slight and low, 
and the rest of it is snow. 






Lascaux
 

Struck a pair of stones to start off. Left behind
ten men curled like scythes round the fire.
Left behind the bracing moon. Passed a pack
of ibex, passed the mammoth. Left the carious
canines before the rath, left the scapula--
freed space for petal dyes, for fixatives.
Passed (in a dream) Chauvet. Alsace. Lorraine.
Past the scree, past the wolf standing sentinel, her
mouth. Struck two stones to hearten the blaze,
sped up; pulled from the sack the manganese, the gilt
mixture of ochre and ore, the animal fat,
the deer bristle. The hare I speared fresh
for better reds. Mash of berries in a rolled frond.
Looked back--still breathing, still lone, set
bone to the bare wall: summoned up the aurochs
in a dervish turn, flank hot with lashes, all hot with dying and kneeling
down. Then nothing. Then the quiet
credit of our kind.





Among Elks
 

Woke in the brume,
lilacs like turf stars.

The late fawn
standing in his syrups;

bucks down the swale
chewing sedge.

We move south
to slopes of sleeping poppy,

past the white alder,
bending heads to scent

of calx--in natural dark
a man tries his hand

at belonging. He
with greave of hide, a born

hood, lay with three
spikes in the clay, green

peak in the breeze.
He whose breathing

wrongs the still.
You stir now to mend,

to redress?
To be one of us, after all this?





J. Finds in His Pocket Neither Change nor Small Bills
 

                      Griffith Park, Los AngelesEvery living heart . . . all over this broad land, will yet swell . . . , when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.                      --Abraham Lincoln
Because the body now and its organs suggest nothing
     but those pathologies in which we've been instructed,
Because the gutter's black as new blood, a Petri dish
     of piss and teeth knocked loose at the root,
Because our walking here's scared up pigeons and the air's
     thick with their disease, because, therefore, we're holding
Our breath in silent prayer, Good People of Los Angeles,
     for our immune systems, for hand sanitizer,
For swift and decisive return of the sun's irradiating
     grace, I can hardly say I even know you much
Beyond the turnstile's slick in the discount supermarket,
     the sidewalk's chewing gum and tuberculosis.
But I've been thinking of you, of your eyes darting behind
     the tinted lenses which minimize exposure to UV, to God-
Knows-what, even though it's dark this morning, cold, cold,
     at least, by our way of thinking: frond-tips glimpsed
Through fog-bank, a dew so lightly acidic we've forgotten
     it's the cause of these few more leaves dropped
From evergreens, the rasp at the back of the throat.
     Members of the Taxpayer's Association, divorce
Attorneys, Good People of Bel Air, you who keep eyes dead
     ahead at the top of freeway off-ramps, who refuse guilt,
That scrap cardboard hungry sign slung over a stack of bones,
     entrance within the Town Car's four doors, the pure, leather-
Scented air there, I've been thinking about those
     other ones, the thousands of indigents and itinerants,
Formerly among us and suffering the debit card's curse
     on the panhandler, who today, because it is December
And dark, because after cremation they've gone so long
     unclaimed, will be buried in mass anonymity somewhere
Far from here, Boyle Heights or East LA, somewhere
     unremarkable: flatland, barred windows, chain-link.
There's a minimum of ceremony. A short benediction
     and half a handful of city employees. Dogs watch
From a distance. It takes a certain kind of distraction,
     a remarkable forgetfulness to not recognize
In those nameless something of that little tyrant, The Self,
     to let history and language fail, let the world outside
Dissolve, a mentholated lozenge on the tongue.
     The taste it leaves is the inability to taste anything else,
And at bottom of the park's southern slope, beneath
     the Hollywood Hills and their Attendant, Contempt, one
Who's wandered a few too many blocks from the halfway
     house's steadying three-times-daily belts into Los Feliz
Boulevard's early rush a few bars of O Lord,
     won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz? before schizophrenia
Changes key again into abject terror's primal screech.
     What's remarkable then is the passing jogger's scandalized
I could just die and the morning's usual by-the-numbers.
     All over the basin pyschotherapists await the DSM-V's
New-phone-book thud on the doorstep, and grave shift
     cryogenicists make the last rounds, check temps, check
The corresponding boxes on log sheets while we continue
     in our unrelenting interrogation of the body: Liver!
How do you plot against me today? Brain! you've gone soft. As if
     deep-within's crowded tissues could confess the knowledge
We most desire, as if we'd not already allowed our private
     pandemic to order our days as on a clear plastic pill case,
As if, I mean, to function were synonymous with to live.
     Right down to it, we all know Death's no more likely
To knock and announce than the LAPD, and though
     he may be gentler, he will not, in the end, read perfunctorily
From a list of rights meant to protect us. Everything
     we've said has always been used against us. Los Feliz:
The Happy Ones. We mispronounce. Force a rhyme
     with Felix. Mispronounce and counteract even irony's
Potential side effects. Los Feliz. The Homeless. The Lesser
     and Underprivileged. The Disturbed. May they all someday
Rest in peace. Good night, Sweet Paupers. Abstraction's
     its own little crime against humanity, but euphemism
Is still a lovely word to say aloud. Los ngeles.
     But what angel is this? Stretched half across the footpath,
Its body's a grotesque, everywhere swollen
     and withered at once. It's gone septic, it's gone
Almost entirely. And what worthless paper is that man
     fumbling with as he approaches? A thinning five maybe,
Lincoln's etched face a gaunt pockmark, beard and ears,
     or else the "Elegy for Sky & Gooseflesh penciled
On an expired bus transfer? It's a worthless scene:
     a man in headphones and an angel which actually appears
To be something much more like a beggar, except
     that it's passed out and so freed of the beggar's contractual
Obligations. Starved and curled into itself, it looks
     freed even of this world, like something almost not
There at all, a fact the man uses as excuse to keep walking,
     his step timed to the beat, his eyes scanning ahead
For needles, slivered glass, the more subtle sort of dangers.
     What else could he possibly do? Kneel down
And slip stealthily something into the blistered palm
     of its hand? Cover its body with the fallen fronds
Which we can't now help but imagine as resembling wings
     because we're thinking instead of a man slowly dying
In a public park about a real angel and so The Eternal
     and so the failing health of our own souls, a disorder
For which the FDA has yet approved no treatment. Disorder,
     as if it were simply a matter of finding the right arrangement
Of bodies in space. But what can we do, all exactly mad
     with grief for ourselves or hobbled with debt's deep
Tissue bruise? Because in mourning we are to gather
     together, Shoppers of the Miracle Mile, Day Traders,
Night Watchmen, but we're all just standing here
     like fools, unable to look each other in the eyes,
Unable to believe in anything at the unchanging core
     of being but a phantom limb's complete and constant
Wing-ache, because we are what multiplies, the desert
     as it reaches towards even you, Citizens of the Once Frozen
North. In mourning we are to remember, but memory's
     emaciated; there was something supposed to become more
Perfect, something else about what always comes of tyrants,
     but who knows? In mourning we meet in need,
But here in a circle at last, tell me what ridiculous things
     we could possibly ask of each other. Spare a buck?
Sing a little prayer for me? The overcast buckles
     under the weight of a singed and empty sky. Because
There's next to nothing left, America, call our
     name; please, won't you please lay on your hands?





This Gentle Surgery
 

Once more the bright blade of a morning breeze
glides almost too easily through me,

and from the scuffle I've been sutured to
some flap of me is freed: I am severed

like a simile: an honest tenor
trembling toward the vehicle I mean

to be: a blackbird licking half notes
from the muscled, sap-damp branches

of the sugar maple tree . . . though I am still 
a part of any part of every particle

of me, though I'll be softly reconstructed
by the white gloves of metonymy,

I grieve: there is no feeling in a cut
that doesn't heal a bit too much.





Sifting in the Afternoon
 

Some people might describe this room as spare:
a bedside table and an ashtray and an antique

chair; a mattress and a coffee mug;
an unwashed cotton blanket and a rug

my mother used to own. I used to have
a phone. I used to have another

room, a bigger broom, a wetter sponge.
I used to water my bouquet

of paper clips and empty pens, of things
I thought I'd want to say if given chance;

but now, to live, to sit somehow, to watch
a particle of thought dote on the dust

and dwindle in a little grid of shadow 
on the sunset's patchy rust seems like enough.





I Speak to the Girl Some Dim Boy Loves
 

(after Hugo)

It takes the table girl a week to learn the route:
The patient spray of table tops, the swirl of cloth
The food to scrap and dishes on the belt become
Her world--students at their complicated books

Are of another life--but in six months
A year or less, she'll have their manners down:
A little splash of color to her polyester dress
A flick of wrist or hair, a lipstick smear and
She'll be more like one of them than any of them dates.

This is the state solution--employing her kind
Here among the population who decides
The number of any kind a society can abide.
We are the learned few, the two or three

Who make the rules, who read the books
That tell us how humane we've made this life:
The charity of how we grow polite enough
To pin the handicapped to our routines.

The table girl keeps thirty tables clean
And speaks only to the boy who works the dishes
From conveyer belt to sink, who elevates and leaves
Her hopeful as her dyed blonde hair.

But her face will not grow beyond its flat despair
And I believe I've fathomed all of this alone as dishes
Slip across the belt's rubber sheet, until one day
I place humanity beside my Goodwill stare and ask:

How goes your day? She says: "Monday, Clive dropped
The baby on its head--things ain't been the same since.
Birds seem louder--the stream is down to a trickle.
I 'spect we'll bury the baby tomorrow. My cup falls over.
She clatter-bangs more dishes on the belt.





You and Me and Veronica Lake
 

I used to smoke before they opened
my chest and surgery filled the dark
clouds roiling and rain turned acid.
My best friend died lungs full of ashes
her hula skirts dry grass rustling
in the corner  then another
friend and poems scattered on pages
like incomplete love letters
sprinkles from old pipes.
I used to smoke after lost loves

and Johnny-come-lately's
some rings singalling the best
sex or the worst  the room
clouded blue under a moon gone bad
tabacco sweat leather apple smell
into sunrise stink of an old shoe.
I used to hold up my finger to find
the moon  the end stained yellow
smoke rings dancing above my head
like haloes of broken moons.
I smoked past several husbands

and loyal friends  lungs charred
black and sliced on a surgeon's plate
from the burning kiss and coffin nails
voice lost in phlegm blooming cloudy
white to yellow. I smoked afternoons
thinking I think I believe smoking
makes anything possible  the sexiest
come-hither look or wise pause
taking you straight to the stroke
of the pen. I smoked with silver
holsters  the best tobaccos  coughs

levelling the field. I smoked
with gangsters and preachers
and mothers waiting for diapers
and fitted sheets  oh we were
the best in those days when
the best could be measured easily
by filters and name brands and what's
up front that counts. I smoked
when glory days were good days
and mystery was repartee in a bar
snappy lines thrown by some old

Viceroy leading man to the nearest
femme fatale. I smoke happily
gloriously helter-skelter
and pell-mell. I smoked when suzy
parker was The Face  dionne
warwick crooned for bacharach and cadillacs
had fins. I smoked to live
fast love hard die young and rise
again like a fresh face from celluloid
heaven waiting beside a smoky piano
spotlight a blurred moon behind blue clouds
and me singing torch songs forever.





Some Are Dead and Some Are Living
 

ima gonna tattoo me on you for ever
leave my creases inside you creases
    --SONIA SANCHEZ

1. Senesta

St. Louis evenings spoiling under electric lights
We leaned out the window above the tavern roof.
Her name better than any song on the juke box. 
I'd say: Senesta, Look! That one and That. 
The sights male and musk: new smells inside some
Teenage fantasy and no one more surprised 
Than us when the answer--deep as Wardell's
Cool bass jazz--floated up through the window
And grabbed us by the scruff.
Left us feeling bad as any tough girl
Worse even--knowing we could never be.
And the lights flickering Bud Bud Budweiser
And the night inching toward dawn
And the two of us hanging forever over the sill.


2. Kay Frances

Led that prairie town around by the nose she did
As if her tar paper house wasn't built right
On Kansas tracks and kinky hair wasn't a dead give-away
Even with light skin, grey eyes and all.
She was townie queen and I rose to her summons, floating
With the others from college across double iron rails.
Left me singing: Don't the moon look lonesome
When passing trains rattled the wallpaper pattern.
And I pretended not to hear the Great Northern
Or Eastern Flyer shaking coffee cups filled with gin
While bidwhist plays danced on the Naugahyde table.
Ice cubes slammed against my teeth like home runs
And mulatto-boned Kay behind a sweet curtsey smile
Watched me play, shivering in the tunnel of sounds.


3. Margaret

No doubt we always thought of leaving
That town reeking of beef on the hoof
The heel and toe of rundown cowboy boots
12th and Vine littered in bad blues.
We said we had plans to cross more lines
Than the packing house bridge separating states.
We wanted to make it big in some place
Where colors meant more than they appeared
And prairies were no more permanent than celluloid.
Now I hear pregnant with baby boys you turned
Almost religious--could have sworn--nearly did
After I skipped town singing: Rocky Raccoon.
I held your voice miles away and that last
Phone call so far so close to my ear.


4. Snow

Behind your back we said it was your attitude
But something more elusive made us marvel 
At the stance you took, feet toed out and ready
With the part of you that was hoodlum trapped 
In a crazy mix of caprice and avarice.
If there had been tracks down the middle
Of this town, I would have met you crossing
And no matter what, asked whether 
I was going the wrong way--Let me guess
You never needed anyone to tell you
It's tough out here and nobody dared 
Call you half-pint even with that gravelly 
Voice and nail hard way you don't touch, your skin
Velvet shadows as we reach and you turn away.


5. Toni Cade

Even when I tell you Seattle rolls up
At midnight you won't take no for an answer.
Hell, you couldn't take no for a question.
So we drive miles for the sake of Ethiopian 
Cowpeas, kifto and spongy bread served 
Under fading posters of drylongso countries.
By word of mouth we stay alive, you say
Out here, you say, justice wears a newspaper hat
A single word in print dissolves whole families.
Over your shoulder, sidama stones rise from a poster.
We talk about moods and shrugs and why paths cross.
It's the stories, you say, the stories and I watch
You wet your finger in a bowl of rough salt
Lick it clean and say: sometimes even this is sweet.


6. Jennie

Perhaps in your half-sleep world
You are still dancing in the living room
Rug thrown back to the quick kiss
Of your feet on bare wood floors.
Perhaps each visit merely interrupts
A day you remember best wordless
Behind the slow flutter of eyelids.
Perhaps you still guide us half-grown
Girls through hours of etiquette on how
To pour the proper rise of champagne
In water glasses or how right to find
Four leaves on clover growing in gutters.
Perhaps sweet Auntie the moon you taught me
To dream is still lovely and you remember to believe.


7. Fingerprints

Marked by a time when there were sidewalk games
And boundaries of the heart and home, we broke
Rules: don't cross the tracks, step on the cracks.
What our mothers didn't know didn't hurt them.
We grew like Topsy into women, no roads to pave
Our way, no looking back. I'd like to say we never
Attended to skin color, slapping palms for Mary Mack
Pick-up sticks and Jacks. I'd like to say I recall
Your faces clear as the day I tore my seersucker dress
Climbing the fence or took my first kiss under a night
Sky full of fireflies. I need to tell you this:
How memory served up in bits and pieces and yesterdays
Becomes so dj-vu, I swear I almost see all of you
Standing there in the corner of the room.






A Crown of Autumn Leaves
 

For Mabon (fall equinox), Sept. 21
Our voices press 
from us 
and twine
around the year's 
fermenting wine

Yellow fall roars
Over the ground.
Loud, in the leafy sun that pours
Liquid through doors,
Yellow, the leaves twist down


as the winding
of the vine
pulls our curling
voices--

Glowing in wind and change,
The orange leaf tells

How one more season will alter and range,
Working the strange
Colors of clamor and bells

In the winding 
of the vine
our voices press out 
from us 
to twine

When autumn gathers, the tree
That the leaves sang
Reddens dark slowly, then, suddenly free,
Turns like a key,
Opening air where they hang

and the winding
of the vine
makes our voices
turn and wind
with the year's
fermented wine

One of the hanging leaves,
Deeply maroon,
Tightens its final hold, receives,
Finally weaves
Through, and is covered soon

in the winding
of the vine--

Holding past summer's hold,
Open and strong,
One of the leaves in the crown is gold,
Set in the cold
Where the old seasons belong.

Here is my crown
Of winding vine,
Of leaves that dropped,
That fingers twined,
another crown
to yield and shine
with a year's
fermented wine.







Chain of Women
 

These are the seasons Persephone promised
as she turned on her heel--
the ones that darken, till green no longer
bandages what I feel.

Now touches of gold stipple the branches,
promising weeks of time
to fade through, finding the footprints
she left as she turned to climb.






Samhain
 

(The Celtic Halloween)
In the season leaves should love,
since it gives them leave to move
through the wind, towards the ground
they were watching while they hung,
legend says there is a seam
stitching darkness like a name.

Now when dying grasses veil
earth from the sky in one last pale
wave, as autumn dies to bring
winter back, and then the spring,
we who die ourselves can peel
back another kind of veil

that hangs among us like thick smoke.
Tonight at last I feel it shake.
I feel the nights stretching away
thousands long behind the days
till they reach the darkness where
all of me is ancestor.

I move my hand and feel a touch
move with me, and when I brush
my own mind across another,
I am with my mother's mother.
Sure as footsteps in my waiting
self, I find her, and she brings

arms that carry answers for me,
intimate, a waiting bounty.
"Carry me." She leaves this trail
through a shudder of the veil,
and leaves, like amber where she stays,
a gift for her perpetual gaze.






Another Reluctance
 

Chestnuts fell in the charred season,
Fell finally, finding room
In air to open their old cases
So they gleam out from the gold leaves,
In the dusk now, where they dropped down.

I go watch them, waiting for winter,
Their husks open and holding on.
Those rusted rims are rigid=hard
And cling clean to the clear brown,

And the fall sun sinks soon,
And the day draws to its dark end,
.and the feet give up the gray walk,
no longer lingering, light gone,
and I am here and do not go home.

Hollow gifts to cold children:
The chestnuts they hid in small caches
Have gone hollow, their gleam gone,
Their grain gone, and the children are home.






Final Autumn
 

Maple leaves turn black in the courtyard.
Light drives lower and one bluejay crams
our cold memories out past the sun,

each time your traces come past the shadows
and visit under my looking-glass fingers
that lift and block out the sun.

Come--I'll trace you one final autumn,
and you can trace your last homecoming
into the snow or the sun.






Moon From the Porch
 

Moon has dusks for walls,
October's days for a floor,
crickets for rooms, windy halls.
Only one night is her door.

When I was thirteen she found me,
spiralled into my blood like a hive.
I stood on a porch where she wound me
for the first time, tight and alive,

till my body flooded to find her:
to know I would not be alone
as I moved through the tides that don't bind her
into womanhood, like a flung stone.

With each curve that waxed into fullness
I grew to her, ready and wild.
I filled myself up like her priestess.
I emptied myself like her child.

Flooding, ready, and certain,
I hid her--full, fallow, or frail--
beneath each long summer's rich curtain.
It covered her face--the thin grail

that delivers me now. Now I'm with her.
All cast shadows come home.
I stand in these shadows to kiss her;
I spin in her cool, calming storm.

Now as I move through my own beauty
and my shadow grows deeper than blood,
oh triple, oh goddess, sustain me
with your light's simple opening hood.






$$$Expensive Magic$$$
 

            I stumble down        around torn peaks
                          "Fit the right suit

Simple Gift
 

              The mouth of the cavern
is cut along the top like snowy peaks
in cartoons--it zigzags. I sweat onto
my violet shirt in the shape
of a heart, lock that away
behind varnish, a hidden floor
between stalactites
               (long trick knives)
                    A lady of Falconbridge & lady
of Dorset
           torn back
through the center & made quiet
A paper cut black branch set
on a red field. A horse
draws the carriage past a lake
of blue & all the kids
            are laid down
in the forest to live
                   tilt their heads back,
                   Don't think of stopping
your shooting, more drinking!
These are to be
                       among the permanent
            (wrong) colors
Ice rats in stairwells, above us
centaurs smack their heads
into light bulbs. They get excited
          over massacre
Who were once
     the innocents who never hoped
to live out unspoken prayer. A country
that laid so dark so long
                                 Pyramids send word
     to the painted mountains
               don't try to lie down
as it gets late. stay on guard
study your drums & then tighten, pound back
          a few shots more
                  ash on the sea floors
Don't you scrape away too many organs
or paint over.
                   Do not temper the spirit.

Oxford
 

Homeless and never sadder,
dragging bags, spending money,
leaning over luggage,
suddenly saying, "Without you, God,
I can't continue. Who was that?

And then I lift it and walk 
to find one book.

Up Iffley Turn to the Hawkwell and Tree Inns
and down over a lock
into an extended filthy river
through the Thames Valley
and over a meadow into town:
two fats,
one fishing and one man on a bike
swerving through Cotswold cow pads.
I ask:
"Do you know the fastest way
to City Centre?

No, yes, no!
Circle Magdalen College, and the mall, the High,
Broad Street, po and Headington Hill,
Brookside and Christ Church,
cross big pavement stones and cobbles
to Holywell
and down North Parade, Maison Blanc, Browns,
the Phoenix Cinema on Walton Street
where you can bring your wine into the film.
Asbestos,
white dust, condiments, Pret Manger,
T.S. Eliot, Philip Larkin, smelly markets, buskers 
on a harp
and a xylophone, buses and bicycles.
Red-faced riotously quiet British. . . .
Earl green carpets and rotten wood frames,
lavender, and buttery daisies,
flagelot beans, bar food, the stink of perfumes
over toilets, Blackwell has none,
St. Philips does, what are you looking for:

Thomas Merton.

(There are so many mental ways
and Abbot Patrick in his cassock stands high above
and smiles and says You see? It's all right
the church is in ruins.)

The devil runs the world was Adam's discovery
and now it is time to pray
before Blake's engravings of the double bind.
I made this fruit for you. Don't eat it! 

"Do you carry The Seven Storey Mountain?

No.
Everything you see is finished.
Even the ground underfoot and ahead.  
The stars and the dancing planets--over.
A grand finale unfolds across the lens.
There is no present.  
The book is out of print.






My Mother Would Be a Falconress
 

My mother would be a falconress,
And I, her gay falcon treading her wrist,
would fly to bring back
from the blue of the sky to her, bleeding, a prize, 
where I dream in my little hood with many bells 
jangling when I'd turn my head.

My mother would be a falconress, 
and she sends me as far as her will goes. 
She lets me ride to the end of her curb 
where I fall back in anguish.
I dread that she will cast me away, 
for I fall, I mis-take, I fail in her mission.

She would bring down the little birds. 
And I would bring down the little birds. 
When will she let me bring down the little birds, 
pierced from their flight with their necks broken, 
their heads like flowers limp from the stem?

I tread my mother's wrist and would draw blood.
Behind the little hood my eyes are hooded.
I have gone back into my hooded silence,
talking to myself and dropping off to sleep.

For she has muffled my dreams in the hood she has made me, 
sewn round with bells, jangling when I move.
She rides with her little falcon upon her wrist. 
She uses a barb that brings me to cower. 
She sends me abroad to try my wings 
and I come back to her. I would bring down 
the little birds to her
I may not tear into, I must bring back perfectly.

I tear at her wrist with my beak to draw blood, 
and her eye holds me, anguisht, terrifying. 
She draws a limit to my flight.
Never beyond my sight, she says.
She trains me to fetch and to limit myself in fetching.
She rewards me with meat for my dinner.
But I must never eat what she sends me to bring her.

Yet it would have been beautiful, if she would have carried me, 
always, in a little hood with the bells ringing,
at her wrist, and her riding 
to the great falcon hunt, and me
flying up to the curb of my heart from her heart 
to bring down the skylark from the blue to her feet, 
straining, and then released for the flight.

My mother would be a falconress, 
and I her gerfalcon raised at her will, 
from her wrist sent flying, as if I were her own 
pride, as if her pride
knew no limits, as if her mind 
sought in me flight beyond the horizon.

Ah, but high, high in the air I flew. 
And far, far beyond the curb of her will, 
were the blue hills where the falcons nest. 
And then I saw west to the dying sun--
it seemd my human soul went down in flames.

I tore at her wrist, at the hold she had for me,
until the blood ran hot and I heard her cry out,
far, far beyond the curb of her will

to horizons of stars beyond the ringing hills of the world where the falcons nest
I saw, and I tore at her wrist with my savage beak.
I flew, as if sight flew from the anguish in her eye beyond her sight,
sent from my striking loose, from the cruel strike at her wrist,
striking out from the blood to be free of her.

My mother would be a falconress,
and even now, years after this,
when the wounds I left her had surely heald,
and the woman is dead,
her fierce eyes closed, and if her heart 
were broken, it is stilld

I would be a falcon and go free.
I tread her wrist and wear the hood,
talking to myself, and would draw blood.





Structure of Rime XXVIII: In Memoriam Wallace Stevens
 

"That God is colouring Newton doth shew--William Blake
          Erecting beyond the boundaries of all government his grand Station and Customs, I find what I have made there a Gate, a staking out of his art in Inconsequence.  I have in mind a poetry that will frame the willingness of the heart and deliver it over to the arrest of Time, a sentence  as if there could stand some solidity  most spacial in its intent against the drifts and appearances that arise and fall away in time from the crude events of physical space.  The Mind alone holds the consequence of the erection to be true, so that Desire and Imagination usurp the place of the Invisible Throne.

          It is an angel then, weeping and yet ever attending the betrayal of the Word I mean to come to in the end.  For my sake, the blood must be somewhere in time and in its own naming of place actual, and death must be  as my own awaits me  immediate to undo from its reality the physical body, all there is of the matter of me that is mine from me.  The would-be dialecticians--Inquisitors of the New Dispensation in Poetry and Historians of Opprobrium, the Realists and Materialists--come forward to hold the party line against his ideality.  There are too many listeners.  There are too many voices in the one line.  They must enter the Ideal to do so, for he has changed his mind, as if the Eternal existed only momentarily and went out with him.  The Chairman of the Politbureau gets his number  and moves to isolate his heresy.  The number is no longer the same.  He has gone back into the exchange of numbers.  The phone continues ringing in the pattern of the message they strive to listen  to report to the Bureau of Poetic Numbers and Approved Measures.

          This is to say to the month of April and the rainbow dancer, I am with you.  I belong to the company without number.  I shall live one hundred years and then be gone.  Here and now  only I from this life can come forward to impersonate the necessity of his being here.  His, the horizon.  His, the perspectives and outlines.  His, the regulation of the relevant.  I will willingly assume his numbers among my own.

          The rest is all Asia, the astral miasma, the Undoing we came from, my version of Who-He-Is-In-Reality, the domain of colouring invading the Responsible.

Dog
 

The dog trots freely in the street
and sees reality
and the things he sees
are bigger than himself
and the things he sees
are his reality
Drunks in doorways 
Moons on trees
The dog trots freely thru the street
and the things he sees
are smaller than himself
Fish on newsprint
Ants in holes
Chickens in Chinatown windows
their heads a block away
The dog trots freely in the street
and the things he smells
smell something like himself
The dog trots freely in the street
past puddles and babies
cats and cigars
poolrooms and policemen
He doesn't hate cops
He merely has no use for them
and he goes past them
and past the dead cows hung up whole
in front of the San Francisco Meat Market
He would rather eat a tender cow
than a tough policeman
though either might do
And he goes past the Romeo Ravioli Factory
and past Coit's Tower
and past Congressman Doyle
He's afraid of Coit's Tower
but he's not afraid of Congressman Doyle
although what he hears is very discouraging
very depressing
very absurd
to a sad young dog like himself
to a serious dog like himself
But he has his own free world to live in
His own fleas to eat
He will not be muzzled
Congressman Doyle is just another
fire hydrant
to him
The dog trots freely in the street
and has his own dog's life to live
and to think about
and to reflect upon
touching and tasting and testing everything
investigating everything 
without benefit of perjury

with a real tale to tell
and a real tail to tell it with

                                                               and how to hear it
with his head cocked sideways
                                       at streetcorners
as if he is just about to have 
                                       his picture taken

                 with its wondrous hollow horn
                         which always seems
                     just about to spout forth
                                                      some Victorious answer

from Dante tudes: Book Three: In My Youth Not Unstaind
 

[tude from the Fourth Treatise of the Convivio, Chapter XXVII]

In my youth, not unstaind
and in much ignoble;   in manhood,
struggling to ring true   yet
knowing often my defection from
these graces Dante lists
proper to Man:   temperance, courage,
love, courtesy,
and loyalty.   I speak still
to sustain his meaning in my own.
And, in you, whatever I have known
of grace comes through to me.

Now, upon old age:   "Our life
has a fixt course and a simple path
I would not avoid, "that of our right nature
--then Dante adds, himself quoting:
"and in every part of our life
 place is given for certain things:

a memory of the good of things before,
a knowledge of good things present,
and foresight of things yet to be made good--

ennobling song, truth's clarion,
beauty renderd lasting in the mind,
obedience to our common cause
       stirrd once again,
that music that to orders larger than
       mankind
restoreth man.





Flowers by the Sea
 

When over the flowery, sharp pasture's
edge, unseen, the salt ocean

lifts its form--chicory and daisies
tied, released, seem hardly flowers alone

but color and the movement--or the shape
perhaps--of restlessness, whereas

the sea is circled and sways
peacefully upon its plantlike stem





At the Justice Department November 15, 1969
 

Brown gas-fog, white
beneath the street lamps.
Cut off on three sides, all space filled
with our bodies.
       Bodies that stumble
in brown airlessness, whitened
in light, a mildew glare,
       that stumble
hand in hand, blinded, retching.
Wanting it, wanting
to be here, the body believing it's
dying in its nausea, my head
clear in its despair, a kind of joy,
knowing this is by no means death,
is trivial, an incident, a
fragile instant.    Wanting it, wanting
          with all my hunger this anguish,
          this knowing in the body
the grim odds we're
up against, wanting it real.
Up that bank where gas
curled in the ivy, dragging each other
up, strangers, brothers
and sisters.    Nothing
will do but 
to taste the bitter
taste. No life
other, apart from.





Wedding-Ring
 

My wedding-ring lies in a basket
as if at the bottom of a well.
Nothing will come to fish it back up
and onto my finger again.
                                      It lies
among keys to abandoned houses,
nails waiting to be needed and hammered
into some wall,
telephone numbers with no names attached,
idle paperclips.
                      It can't be given away
for fear of bringing ill-luck
                      It can't be sold
for the marriage was good in its own
time, though that time is gone.
                      Could some artificer
beat into it bright stones, transform it
into a dazzling circlet no one could take
for solemn betrothal or to make promises
living will not let them keep? Change it
into a simple gift I could give in friendship?





At a Solemn Musick
 

Let the musicians begin,
Let every instrument awaken and instruct us
In love's willing river and love's dear discipline:
We wait, silent, in consent and in the penance
Of patience, awaiting the serene exaltation 
Which is the liberation and conclusion of expiation. 

Now may the chief musician say:
"Lust and emulation have dwelt amoung us
Like barbarous kings: have conquered us:
Have inhabited our hearts: devoured and ravished
--With the savage greed and avarice of fire--
The substance of pity and compassion.

Now may all the players play:
"The river of the morning, the morning of the river
Flow out of the splendor of the tenderness of surrender.

Now may the chief musician say:
"Nothing is more important than summer.

And now the entire choir shall chant:
"How often the astonished heart, 
Beholding the laurel,
Remembers the dead,
And the enchanted absolute,
Snow's kingdom, sleep's dominion.

Then shall the chief musician declare:
"The phoenix is the meaning of the fruit,
Until the dream is knowledge and knowledge is a dream.

And then, once again, the entire choir shall cry, in passionate unity,
Singing and celebrating love and love's victory,
Ascending and descending the heights of assent, climbing and chanting triumphantly:
Before the morning was, you were:
Before the snow shone,
And the light sang, and the stone,
Abiding, rode the fullness or endured the emptiness,
You were: you were alone.






Darkling Summer, Ominous Dusk, Rumorous Rain
 

                                               1

A tattering of rain and then the reign 
Of pour and pouring-down and down,
Where in the westward gathered the filming gown
Of grey and clouding weakness, and, in the mane
Of the light's glory and the day's splendor, gold and vain,
Vivid, more and more vivid, scarlet, lucid and more luminous,
Then came a splatter, a prattle, a blowing rain!
And soon the hour was musical and rumorous:
A softness of a dripping lipped the isolated houses,
A gaunt grey somber softness licked the glass of hours.


                                               2

Again, after a catbird squeaked in the special silence,
And clouding vagueness fogged the windowpane
And gathered blackness and overcast, the mane
Of light's story and light's glory surrendered and ended
--A pebble--a ring--a ringing on the pane,
A blowing and a blowing in: tides of the blue and cold
Moods of the great blue bay, and slates of grey
Came down upon the land's great sea, the body of this day 
--Hardly an atom of silence amid the roar
Allowed the voice to form appeal--to call:
By kindled light we thought we saw the bronze of fall.






In the Green Morning, Now, Once More
 

In the green morning, before
Love was destiny,
The sun was king,
And God was famous.

The merry, the musical, 
The jolly, the magical,
The feast, the feast of feasts, the festival
Suddenly ended
As the sky descended
But there was only the feeling,
In all the dark falling,
Of fragrance and of freshness, of birth and beginning.





October
 

O hushed October morning mild,
Thy leaves have ripened to the fall;
Tomorrow's wind, if it be wild,
Should waste them all.
The crows above the forest call;
Tomorrow they may form and go.
O hushed October morning mild,
Begin the hours of this day slow.
Make the day seem to us less brief.
Hearts not averse to being beguiled,
Beguile us in the way you know.
Release one leaf at break of day;
At noon release another leaf;
One from our trees, one far away.
Retard the sun with gentle mist;
Enchant the land with amethyst.
Slow, slow!
For the grapes' sake, if they were all,
Whose leaves already are burnt with frost,
Whose clustered fruit must else be lost--
For the grapes' sake along the wall.






Reluctance
 

Out through the fields and the woods
   And over the walls I have wended;
I have climbed the hills of view
   And looked at the world, and descended;
I have come by the highway home,
   And lo, it is ended.
 
The leaves are all dead on the ground,
   Save those that the oak is keeping
To ravel them one by one
   And let them go scraping and creeping
Out over the crusted snow,
   When others are sleeping.
 
And the dead leaves lie huddled and still,
   No longer blown hither and thither;
The last lone aster is gone;
   The flowers of the witch hazel wither;
The heart is still aching to seek,
   But the feet question Whither?'
 
Ah, when to the heart of man
   Was it ever less than a treason
To go with the drift of things,
   To yield with a grace to reason,
And bow and accept the end
   Of a love or a season?





Home Burial
 

He saw her from the bottom of the stairs
Before she saw him. She was starting down,
Looking back over her shoulder at some fear.
She took a doubtful step and then undid it
To raise herself and look again. He spoke
Advancing toward her: What is it you see
From up there always--for I want to know.'
She turned and sank upon her skirts at that,
And her face changed from terrified to dull.
He said to gain time: What is it you see,'
Mounting until she cowered under him.
I will find out now--you must tell me, dear.'
She, in her place, refused him any help
With the least stiffening of her neck and silence.
She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,
Blind creature; and awhile he didn't see.
But at last he murmured, Oh,' and again, Oh.'

What is it--what?' she said.

                                          Just that I see.'

You don't,' she challenged. Tell me what it is.'

The wonder is I didn't see at once.
I never noticed it from here before.
I must be wonted to it--that's the reason.
The little graveyard where my people are!
So small the window frames the whole of it.
Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?
There are three stones of slate and one of marble,
Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight
On the sidehill. We haven't to mind those.
But I understand: it is not the stones,
But the child's mound--'

                             Don't, don't, don't, don't,' she cried.

She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm
That rested on the banister, and slid downstairs;
And turned on him with such a daunting look,
He said twice over before he knew himself:
Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?'

Not you! Oh, where's my hat? Oh, I don't need it!
I must get out of here. I must get air.
I don't know rightly whether any man can.'

Amy! Don't go to someone else this time.
Listen to me. I won't come down the stairs.'
He sat and fixed his chin between his fists.
There's something I should like to ask you, dear.'

You don't know how to ask it.'

                                              Help me, then.'

Her fingers moved the latch for all reply.

My words are nearly always an offense.
I don't know how to speak of anything
So as to please you. But I might be taught
I should suppose. I can't say I see how.
A man must partly give up being a man
With women-folk. We could have some arrangement
By which I'd bind myself to keep hands off
Anything special you're a-mind to name.
Though I don't like such things 'twixt those that love.
Two that don't love can't live together without them.
But two that do can't live together with them.'
She moved the latch a little. Don't--don't go.
Don't carry it to someone else this time.
Tell me about it if it's something human.
Let me into your grief. I'm not so much
Unlike other folks as your standing there
Apart would make me out. Give me my chance.
I do think, though, you overdo it a little.
What was it brought you up to think it the thing
To take your mother-loss of a first child
So inconsolably--in the face of love.
You'd think his memory might be satisfied--'

There you go sneering now!'

                                           I'm not, I'm not!
You make me angry. I'll come down to you.
God, what a woman! And it's come to this,
A man can't speak of his own child that's dead.'

You can't because you don't know how to speak.
If you had any feelings, you that dug
With your own hand--how could you?--his little grave;
I saw you from that very window there,
Making the gravel leap and leap in air,
Leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly
And roll back down the mound beside the hole.
I thought, Who is that man? I didn't know you.
And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs
To look again, and still your spade kept lifting.
Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice
Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why,
But I went near to see with my own eyes.
You could sit there with the stains on your shoes
Of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave
And talk about your everyday concerns.
You had stood the spade up against the wall
Outside there in the entry, for I saw it.'

I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed.
I'm cursed. God, if I don't believe I'm cursed.'

I can repeat the very words you were saying:
"Three foggy mornings and one rainy day
Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.
Think of it, talk like that at such a time!
What had how long it takes a birch to rot
To do with what was in the darkened parlor?
You couldn't care! The nearest friends can go
With anyone to death, comes so far short
They might as well not try to go at all.
No, from the time when one is sick to death,
One is alone, and he dies more alone.
Friends make pretense of following to the grave,
But before one is in it, their minds are turned
And making the best of their way back to life
And living people, and things they understand.
But the world's evil. I won't have grief so
If I can change it. Oh, I won't, I won't!'

There, you have said it all and you feel better.
You won't go now. You're crying. Close the door.
The heart's gone out of it: why keep it up.
Amy! There's someone coming down the road!'

You--oh, you think the talk is all. I must go--
Somewhere out of this house. How can I make you--'

If--you--do!' She was opening the door wider.
Where do you mean to go?  First tell me that.
I'll follow and bring you back by force.  I will!--'





Out, Out
 

The buzz saw snarled and rattled in the yard
And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,
Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.
And from there those that lifted eyes could count
Five mountain ranges one behind the other
Under the sunset far into Vermont.
And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,
As it ran light, or had to bear a load.
And nothing happened: day was all but done.
Call it a day, I wish they might have said
To please the boy by giving him the half hour
That a boy counts so much when saved from work.
His sister stood beside him in her apron
To tell them Supper.' At the word, the saw,
As if to prove saws knew what supper meant,
Leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap--
He must have given the hand. However it was, 
Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!
The boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh,
As he swung toward them holding up the hand
Half in appeal, but half as if to keep
The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all--
Since he was old enough to know, big boy
Doing a man's work, though a child at heart-- 
He saw all spoiled. Don't let him cut my hand off--
The doctor, when he comes. Don't let him, sister!'
So. But the hand was gone already.
The doctor put him in the dark of ether.
He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.
And then--the watcher at his pulse took fright.
No one believed. They listened at his heart.
Little--less--nothing!--and that ended it. 
No more to build on there. And they, since they
Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.





The Sound of Trees
 

I wonder about the trees.
Why do we wish to bear
Forever the noise of these
More than another noise
So close to our dwelling place?
We suffer them by the day
Till we lose all measure of pace,
And fixity in our joys,
And acquire a listening air.
They are that that talks of going
But never gets away;
And that talks no less for knowing,
As it grows wiser and older,
That now it means to stay.
My feet tug at the floor
And my head sways to my shoulder
Sometimes when I watch trees sway,
From the window or the door.
I shall set forth for somewhere,
I shall make the reckless choice
Some day when they are in voice
And tossing so as to scare
The white clouds over them on.
I shall have less to say,
But I shall be gone.






Swift
 

What shall Presto do for pretty prattle
To entertain his dears? Sunday: lightning fifty times!
This week to Flanders goes the Duke of Ormond!
Shall hope of him, although he loves me well!

All of my hopes now possible,
None certain. As, my lampoon 
Talked up all over, cried up to the sky
--You are an impudent slut to be so positive
Though all has gone just as you said it would!
Sirrah! write constantly! don't I write every day
And sometimes twice? Stella writes like an emperor. 

Sirrah, I am surprised forever--by myself!
Or by the others--dee dee: an angel child
Stupid in me, stupid or innocent
Astonished by the gush of vanity
The stone and the eyes of pride--yet equally 
By the least straw or glitter of nobility!
--Faith, Madame Dingley, what think you of the world to come?
Patience! Patience is a gay thing--O saucy rogues,
Patience is better than knowledge: be gay til I return. 

Mr. Harley speaks every kind thing to me.
Truly, I do believe, would serve me if I stayed
--Called at the coffee house, stayed there a while, 
Coldly converse with Mr. Addison:

All our friendship and dearness now are off:
Is it not odd? I think he has used me ill:
I have as little pleasure as anyone
In all the world, although I am 
In full favor with the entire ministry.
Nothing gives Presto any dream of happiness
But letters now and then from his delest ones.

The pride of power, the pride and pleasure of place and power are Towers
And trivial toys which lure me grievously 
Ravaging furiously in a lunation's infuriation . . .
Bursting the Rome in my head, my empire!
Gulliver? Gullible! The Caesars in my heart
Tell me how all infamy is possible,
And certain treacheries extremely probable!

I must take leave of deelest MD now. Prithee,
Be merry, patient girls and love your Presto.
I have read all the trash and I am weary:
Deelest lives, there is peace and quiet with thee
And thee alone. None have the leisure here for little things.
Farewell again, dear rogues; I am never happy
But when I think of thee MD. Sirrah,
I have had enough of courts and ministries.
I wish I were once more at Laracor:
Faith, do you know each syllable  I write
I hold my lips exact for all the world 
As if I talked the little language with MD.

Yesterday died the Duke of Ormond's daughter:
Poor dear, she was with child. She was
My favourite pet--save thee--I hardly knew 
A being more valuable, more beautiful, 
Of more nobility. I fear the certainty
That she was thrown away quite carelessly,
And merely lacked care. 'Tis clear, at any rate,
That she was very healthy naturally.
--Her Lord's a puppy. I'll no more of him,
Now that he's lost his only valuable . . .
--I hate life when I see it thus exposed
To accidents like these, so many thousands
Burthening the earth with their stupidity,
While such as she must die--abruptly--pointlessly.

Somebody is coming wants a little place.
My heart is set upon the cherry trees
By the river side. My saucy sluts
Farewell my deelest Nite poo dee MD . . .

Y'see a Sea that's ten miles wide, a town
On t'other side, ships sailing in the Sea
Discharging great Canons at MDs and mee,
I see a great Sky, Moon and Stars, and ALL:
                                        I am a Fool.






America
 

Centre of equal daughters, equal sons,
All, all alike endear'd, grown, ungrown, young or old,
Strong, ample, fair, enduring, capable, rich,
Perennial with the Earth, with Freedom, Law and Love,
A grand, sane, towering, seated Mother,
Chair'd in the adamant of Time.





I Am Offering this Poem
 

I am offering this poem to you,
since I have nothing else to give.
Keep it like a warm coat
when winter comes to cover you,
or like a pair of thick socks
the cold cannot bite through,

                         I love you,

I have nothing else to give you,
so it is a pot full of yellow corn
to warm your belly in winter,
it is a scarf for your head, to wear
over your hair, to tie up around your face,

                         I love you,

Keep it, treasure this as you would
if you were lost, needing direction,
in the wilderness life becomes when mature;
and in the corner of your drawer,
tucked away like a cabin or hogan
in dense trees, come knocking,
and I will answer, give you directions,
and let you warm yourself by this fire,
rest by this fire, and make you feel safe

                         I love you,

It's all I have to give,
and all anyone needs to live,
and to go on living inside,
when the world outside
no longer cares if you live or die;
remember,

                         I love you.





Who Understands Me but Me
 

They turn the water off, so I live without water,
they build walls higher, so I live without treetops,
they paint the windows black, so I live without sunshine,
they lock my cage, so I live without going anywhere,
they take each last tear I have, I live without tears,
they take my heart and rip it open, I live without heart,
they take my life and crush it, so I live without a future,
they say I am beastly and fiendish, so I have no friends,
they stop up each hope, so I have no passage out of hell,
they give me pain, so I live with pain,
they give me hate, so I live with my hate,
they have changed me, and I am not the same man,
they give me no shower, so I live with my smell,
they separate me from my brothers, so I live without brothers,
who understands me when I say this is beautiful?
who understands me when I say I have found other freedoms?

I cannot fly or make something appear in my hand,
I cannot make the heavens open or the earth tremble,
I can live with myself, and I am amazed at myself, my love,
my beauty,
I am taken by my failures, astounded by my fears,
I am stubborn and childish,
in the midst of this wreckage of life they incurred,
I practice being myself,
and I have found parts of myself never dreamed of by me,
they were goaded out from under rocks in my heart
when the walls were built higher,
when the water was turned off and the windows painted black.
I followed these signs
like an old tracker and followed the tracks deep into myself,
followed the blood-spotted path,
deeper into dangerous regions, and found so many parts of myself,
who taught me water is not everything,
and gave me new eyes to see through walls,
and when they spoke, sunlight came out of their mouths,
and I was laughing at me with them,
we laughed like children and made pacts to always be loyal,
who understands me when I say this is beautiful?



CORRECTION: the last line of the first stanza was corrected to read "who understands me when I say I have found other freedoms?", and the first line of the second stanza was corrected to read "I cannot fly or make something appear in my hand," on November 15, 2010.





Eye on the Scarecrow
 

--"mu twentieth part--
The way we lay
  we mimed a body
   of water. It was
this or that way
                              with
         the dead and we
       were them. No
                                  one 
     worried which...
       Millet beer made
 our legs go weak,
                                 loosed
  our tongues. "The dead,
                                                we
       said, "are drowning
    of thirst, gruff
     summons we muttered
  out loud in our
                               sleep...
    It was a journey we
 were on, drawn-out
  scrawl we made a road
of, long huthereed hajj
                                           we 
    were on. Raw strip
   of cloth we now rode,
      wishful, letterless
                                       book
        the ride we thumbed...
    Harp-headed ghost whose
      head we plucked incessantly.
 Bartered star.       Tethered
                                                   run...
   It was a ride we knew we'd
 wish to return to. Every-
     thing was everything,
nothing no less. No less
                                            newly
   arrived or ancestral, of
     late having to do with
  the naming of parts...
    Rolling hills rolled
up like a rug, raw sprawl
                                              of a 
       book within a book
     without a name known as
        Namless, not to be
arrived at again...
                                   It was
   the Book of No Avail we
were in did we dare name
  it, momentary kings and
                                                queens,
     fleet kingdom. Land fell
   away on all sides.

                                    Past 
Lag we caught ourselves,
   run weft at last
 adequate, shadowless,
                                           lit,
    left up Atet Street,
  legs tight, hill after
      hill after hill.
    Had it been a book Book
 of Opening the Book it
    would've been called,
                                            kept
under lock and key...
                                       Hyperbolic
   arrest. Ra was on the
                                          box.
 It was after the end of
the world... To lie on
     our backs looking
   into the dark was all
      there was worth
                                    doing,
  each the aroused eye
one another sought,
     swore he or she
                                  saw
   we lay where love's
 pharaonic torso lay
     deepest, wide-eyed
                                         all
night without sleep...
                                        "String
   our heads with straw, we
  said, half-skulls tied with
     catgut, strummed...
                                          Scratched
    our strummed heads, memory
made us itch. Walked out
  weightless, air what eye
                                              was
      left...

               Someone said Rome,
      someone said destory it.
Atlantis, a third shouted
                                             out...
    Low ride among ruins
 notwithstanding we flew.
  Swam, if often seemed,
underwater, oddly immersed,
                                                       bodies
        long since bid goodbye,
                                                    we
   lay in wait, remote muses
      kept us afloat. Something
 called pursuit had us by
    the nose. Wafted ether
                                               blown
low, tilted floor, splintered
       feet. Throated bone...
   Rickety boat we rode...
                                               As
     though what we wanted
  was to be everywhere at
                                              once,
an altered life lived on an
                                               ideal
       coast we'd lay washed up
         on, instancy and elsewhere
                                                           endlessly
    entwined





On Antiphon Island
 

--"mu twenty-eighth part--
On Antiphon Island they lowered
the bar and we bent back. It
  wasn't limbo we were in albeit
       we limbo'd. Everywhere we
                                                          went we
  limbo'd, legs bent, shoulder
   blades grazing the dirt,
                                              donned
andoumboulouous birth-shirts,
    sweat salting the silence
 we broke... Limbo'd so low we
     fell and lay looking up at
   the clouds, backs embraced by
                                                            the
       ground and the ground a fallen
                                                                 wall
  we were ambushed by... Later we'd
      sit, sipping the fig liqueur, beckoning
 sleep, soon-come somnolence nowhere
     come as yet. Where we were, not-
withstanding, wasn't there...

                                                     Where we
  were was the hold of a ship we were
                                                                    caught
      in. Soaked wood kept us afloat... It
wasn't limbo we were in albeit we
    limbo'd our way there. Where we
 were was what we meant by "mu.
                                                                Where
     we were was real, reminiscent
  arrest we resisted, bodies briefly
                                                              had,
 held on
to
                    

     "A Likkle Sonance it said on the
record. A trickle of blood hung
    overhead I heard it spurts. An
  introvert trumpet run, trickle of
                                                             sound...
      A trickle of water lit by the sun
        I saw with an injured eye, captive
  music ran our legs and we danced...
                                                                    Knees
bent, asses all but on the floor, love's
      bittersweet largesse... I wanted
   trickle turned into flow, flood,
        two made one by music, bodied
                                                                  edge
          gone up into air, aura, atmosphere
              the garment we wore. We were on
            a ship's deck dancing, drawn in a 
                                                                         dream
    above hold... The world was ever after,
                                                                           elsewhere.
Where we were they said likkle for little, lick
     ran with trickle, weird what we took it
  for... The world was ever after, elsewhere, 
                                                                               no
 way where we were 
was there

--orphic fragment--
Carnival morning they
  were Greeks in Brazil,
    Africans in Greek
disguise. Said of herself
                                            she
       was born in a house in
    heaven. He said he was
     born in the house next
 door... They were in hell.
   In Brazil they were
                                       lovebait.
      To abide by hearing was
         what love was... To 
       love was to hear without
    looking. Sound was the
                                               beloved's
     mummy cloth... All to say,
 said the exegete, love in
    hell was a voice, to be spoken
  to from behind, not be able
     to turn and look... It
   wasn't Greece where they 
                                                  were,
 nor was it Benin... Carnival
morning in made-up hell, bodies
    bathed in loquat light, would-be
 song's all the more would-be
     title, "Sound and Cerement,
                                                          voice
      wound in bandages
   raveling
                lapse

                  .

    Up all night, slept well
past noon. Awoke restless
  having dreamt she awoke on
     Lone Coast, wondering
   afterwards what it came 
                                               to,
     glimpsed interstice,
                                         crevice,
       crack... Saw her
  dead mother and brother
pull up in a car, her brother
   at the wheel not having driven
     while alive, newly taught
                                                   by
   death it appeared. A fancy car,
                                                           bigger 
  than any her mother had had while
     alive, she too better off it
appeared... A wishful read, "it
    appeared notwithstanding, the
  exegete impossibly benign. Dreamt
                                                                   a dream
      of dream's end, anxious, unannounced,
   Eronel's nevermore namesake, Monk's
         anagrammatic Lenore... That the
       dead return in luxury cars made 
                                                                  us
        weep, pathetic its tin elegance,
                                                                pitiable,
          sweet read misread,
       would-be
     sweet





Song of the Andoumboulou: 60
 


  The vote came in early. We ignored
   it. No ballout-box auction for us...
Nub's uninstructed dance's bare
     feet, music we took them for.
                                                           At a
 loss with only bodies to fend with,
  nonsonant waves kept coming,
sang without wind,        saltless,
     waterless,         Nub's inverted
 run, Nub newly vented by horns
                                                            blown
   elsewhere, bells full of insect
     husks... Nonsonant scruff held
 on to, sheerness... Nothingness
   it seemed we grabbed at, gathered,
beginning to be unending it seemed.
                                                                   We
   were beginning to be lured again,
ready to be hectored, huthered, move
  on, beginning to be uprooted again...

   A peppered expanse the country we
crossed. Space doled out so stingily
      we wept, love's numb extremity
  the outskirts of Nuh, name whose
                                                                elision
     we embraced... A tale told many
times over, known before it reached
       us, known before we knew, un-
     backed alley of soul we wandered
                                                                  into,
       shadowbox romance it was called...
    Come of late to creation's outskirts,
  rub's new muse a republic of none, a
       yet-to-be band the band we were...
     We were Andoumboulou, dreamt
                                                                  in-
      habitants of "mu, moored but
 immersed, real but made up, so much
     farther flung than we'd have thought...
    They the would-be we lay on a bed
  the size of Outlandish. Lip attesting
        lip, tongue rummaging tongue,
                                                                 took
      between finger and thumb the hem 
    of her dress, flat bead of sweat, salted
                                                                         cloth...
       A hammer hit them each on the head.
     Hammered heads rang and rang without
  end...       Called it creation, called it
   their clime, close where there was otherwise
       distance,       mute endearment,        recondite
     embrace... So much farther, felt even
                                                                         so,
mouth she remembered, home. His to hear
     her tell it, hers were it his to say, whose
   book was of lengthening limbs, hers of
                                                                          the
 unquenchable kiss... A tale told over and
                                                                            over,
    long since known by heart. Lay belly to
  back, turned belly to belly, each the other's
dreamt accompanist, music they made in
 their sleep... Frayed hem the interstice,
                                                                          time's
    moot rule. Time's moot rule amended,
                                                                           echoed

also called

    A first unfallen church of what might've

   be





                     

    They the would-be we talking talk of
election, devotees of Iemanj. Glass-
  green water they were in up to
                                                          their
     shoulders, each the other's moored
recess... The way she said his name stayed
   with him. More made of what wasn't
     there than what was, whispered,
                                                                came

     walk to balcony, rooftop to galaxy,

    More made of what was there than
      was there, mouths vow-heavy at
   bed's edge, lip-touch never to be done.
Never to get up again it seemed, lay
                                                                 shaken,

     what would be... We were caught in a
   dream whispering names we'd forget
     waking up, caught waking up or in a
dream of waking up, moot sound riffling
          our lips. Nub was a name,        was
                                                                          was
    a name,           a was a name, all moving
 on... Names came after us, roused us in
    our sleep, the ballot-box opening grinned
and grinned again, gone we'd have been
                                                                          could
        we have run... It wasn't we were stuck,
      stood frozen, transfixed, Paralytic Dream #12...
   It was waking known otherwise put running
    out of reach, nonsonance's waterless waves held
      us up, more than we could sense but
                                                                          sensed
   even so, nonsonance's
  gaptooth
slur





                    

      Day late so all the old attunements gave
   way, late but soon come even so... A
     political trek we'd have said it was
albeit politics kept us at bay,         nothing
                                                                             wasn't
       politics we'd say. Wanting our want to
    be called otherwise, kept at bay though
     we were, day late but all the old stories
                                                                             echoed
  yet again, old but even so soon come... A
    mystic march they'd have said it was,
      acknowledging politics kept us at

      Nub no longer stood but lay and we

Freely Espousing
 

a commingling sky

                      a semi-tropic night
                      that cast the blackest shadow
                      of the easily torn, untrembling banana leaf

or Quebec! what a horrible city
so Steubenville is better?
                          the sinking sensation
when someone drowns thinking, "This can't be happening to me!
the profit of excavating the battlefield where Hannibal whomped the Romans
the sinuous beauty of words like allergy
the tonic resonance of
pill when used as in
"she is a pill
on the other hand I am not going to espouse any short stories in which lawn mowers clack.
No, it is absolutely forbidden
for words to echo the act described; or try to. Except very directly
as in
bong. And tickle. Oh it is inescapable kiss. 
Marriages of the atmosphere
are worth celebrating 
                          where Tudor City
catches the sky or the glass side
of a building lit up at night in fog
"What is that gold-green tetrahedron down the river?
"You are experiencing a new sensation.

               if the touch-me-nots
               are not in bloom
               neither are the chrysanthemums

the bales of pink cotton candy
in the slanting light
                are ornamental cherry trees.
                The greens around them, and
                the browns, the grays, are the park.
It's. Hmm. No.
             Their scallop shell of quiet 
             is the S.S. United States.
             It is not so quiet and they
             are a medium-size couple who
             when they fold each other up
             well, thrill. That's their story.





A Man in Blue
 

Under the French horns of a November afternoon
a man in blue is raking leaves
with a wide wooden rake (whose teeth are pegs
or rather, dowels). Next door
boys play soccer: "You got to start
over! sort of. A round attic window 
in a radiant gray house waits like a kettledrum.
"You got to start . . . The Brahmsian day
lapses from waltz to march. The grass, 
rough-cropped as Bruno Walter's hair,
is stretched, strewn and humped beneath a sycamore
wide and high as an idea of heaven
in which Brahms turns his face like a bearded thumb
and says, "There is something I must tell you!
to Bruno Walter. "In the first movement 
of my Second, think of it as a family
planning where to go next summer
in terms of other summers. A material ecstasy, 
subdued, recollective. Bruno Walter
in a funny jacket with a turned-up collar
says, "Let me sing it for you. 
He waves his hands and through the vocalese-shaped spaces
of naked elms he draws a copper beech
ignited with a few late leaves. He bluely glazes
a rhododendron "a sea of leaves against gold grass.
There is a snapping from the brightwork
of parked and rolling cars.
There almost has to be a heaven! so there could be
a place for Bruno Walter
who never needed the cry of a baton.
Immortality--
in a small, dusty, rather gritty, somewhat scratchy
Magnavox from which a forte
drops like a used Brillo Pad?
Frayed. But it's hard to think of the sky as a thick glass floor
with thick-soled Viennese boots tromping about on it.
It's a whole lot harder thinking of Brahms
in something soft, white, and flowing.
"Life, he cries (here, in the last movement),
"is something more than beer and skittles!
"And the something more
is a whole lot better than beer and skittles,
says Bruno Walter,
darkly, under the sod. I don't suppose it seems so dark
to a root. Who are these men in evening coats?
What are these thumps?
Where is Brahms?
And Bruno Walter?
Ensconced in resonant plump easy chairs
covered with scuffed brown leather
in a pungent autumn that blends leaf smoke
(sycamore, tobacco, other), 
their nobility wound in a finale
like this calico cat 
asleep, curled up in a breadbasket,
on a sideboard where the sun falls.





Nineteen-twenty-nine
 

Some folks hollered hard times
in nineteen-twenty-nine.
In nineteen-twenty-eight
say I was way behind.

Some folks hollered hard times
because hard times were new.
Hard times is all I ever had,
why should I lie to you?

Some folks hollered hard times.
What is it all about?
Things were bad for me when
those hard times started out.





Hard-time blues
 

Went down home 'bout a year ago
things so bad, Lord, my heart was sore.
Folks had nothing was a sin and shame
every-body said hard time was the blame.
      Great-God-a-mighty folks feeling bad 
      lost every thing they ever had.

Sun was shining fourteen days and no rain
hoeing and planting was all in vain.
Hard hard times, Lord, all around
meal barrels empty crops burnt to the ground.
      Great-God-a-mighty folks feeling bad 
       lost every thing they ever had.

Skinny looking children bellies poking out
that old pellagra without a doubt.
Old folks hanging 'round the cabin door
ain't seen times this hard before.
      Great-God-a-mighty folks feeling bad
      lost every thing they ever had.

I went to the Boss at the Commissary store
folks all starving please don't close your door
want more food a little more time to pay
Boss Man laughed and walked away.
      Great-God-a-mighty folks feeling bad 
       lost every thing they ever had.

Landlord coming 'round when the rent is due
you ain't got the money take your home from you
take your mule and horse even take your cow
get offa my land you ain't no good no how.
      Great-God-a-mighty folks feeling bad 
       lost every thing they ever had.





The Thanksgivings
 

We who are here present thank the Great Spirit that we are here
          to praise Him.

          and hope they will be privileged to continue in his faith.
We thank the Great Spirit for all the persons who perform the ceremonies

The Pumpkin
 

Oh, greenly and fair in the lands of the sun, 
The vines of the gourd and the rich melon run, 
And the rock and the tree and the cottage enfold, 
With broad leaves all greenness and blossoms all gold, 
Like that which o'er Nineveh's prophet once grew, 
While he waited to know that his warning was true, 
And longed for the storm-cloud, and listened in vain 
For the rush of the whirlwind and red fire-rain. 

On the banks of the Xenil the dark Spanish maiden 
Comes up with the fruit of the tangled vine laden; 
And the Creole of Cuba laughs out to behold 
Through orange-leaves shining the broad spheres of gold; 
Yet with dearer delight from his home in the North, 
On the fields of his harvest the Yankee looks forth, 
Where crook-necks are coiling and yellow fruit shines, 
And the sun of September melts down on his vines. 

Ah! on Thanksgiving day, when from East and from West, 
From North and from South come the pilgrim and guest, 
When the gray-haired New Englander sees round his board 
The old broken links of affection restored, 
When the care-wearied man seeks his mother once more, 
And the worn matron smiles where the girl smiled before, 
What moistens the lip and what brightens the eye? 
What calls back the past, like the rich Pumpkin pie? 

Oh, fruit loved of boyhood! the old days recalling, 
When wood-grapes were purpling and brown nuts were falling! 
When wild, ugly faces we carved in its skin, 
Glaring out through the dark with a candle within! 
When we laughed round the corn-heap, with hearts all in tune, 
Our chair a broad pumpkin,--our lantern the moon, 
Telling tales of the fairy who travelled like steam, 
In a pumpkin-shell coach, with two rats for her team! 

Then thanks for thy present! none sweeter or better 
E'er smoked from an oven or circled a platter! 
Fairer hands never wrought at a pastry more fine, 
Brighter eyes never watched o'er its baking, than thine! 
And the prayer, which my mouth is too full to express, 
Swells my heart that thy shadow may never be less, 
That the days of thy lot may be lengthened below, 
And the fame of thy worth like a pumpkin-vine grow, 
And thy life be as sweet, and its last sunset sky 
Golden-tinted and fair as thy own Pumpkin pie!





Twilight Train
 

Now the pink is in the water
its wavy edges celebrated
by cars & guys with hands
in pockets staring out. A woman
chewing gum by the window
of the train. Which heaves
its accordion on & we move.
They call it choo-choo
because of the faint chooing
sound as it starts. It's
twee too & dit dit dit
eel & screech. All this as
the colors change. The buildings
they bothered to paint
white are pink like
someone's awful socks
were mistakenly
washed. Who owns
this insidious red. The
trees are black
cause that's where the green
goes. The girl who chews
has fanned her fingers
out below the glass
and I long to stare
at them. To count
them one by one
as the wires slip
by. It's the sultriness,
the smokey approach
of the loss of
light that I love. The
homosexual lilac
comes & it's ours
& everyone like us. The
bright compartment
of white lights &
gleaming flip top &
yawns rage
on. Outside the Hudson
River queerness tools
on my brain like
a hopeless little
wallet of feeling. A clear
swipe to night. Everyone
in my compartment
is tearing now. It's true,
I heard two sheets
at once get torn
to pluck a brownie
out. Its smell
oozes, & the other
one, god knows
whose--to park
her gum? Her hands
are holding her
head, my silent
partner's & she's
sleeping (deep in my gaze.) I look
at her knees, the wrinkled
foot just above
the heel, a yellowish
unmoody pink. The trees
crowd the house &
finally we go fast
finally it's not so
warm on the train
& boats are sitting
on purple sand
the mountains
are bland & blue
a woman's sigh
is falling
off, from on
high and
into her body.
My partner's
knees sway.
Someone says
Proust. Or was
it Bruce. The train
is rough. Cutting
through sweetness
every night.
I think "time."
Then "cargo."






Rotting Symbols
 

Soon I shall take more
I will get more light
and I'll know what I think
about that

Driving down Second Ave. in a car
the frieze of my hand
like a grandmother
captured in an institution
I know I'll never live here again etc.
many many long years ago
Millions of peeps in the scrawl
the regular trees
the regular dog snort &
dig. In the West Village
you could put on a hat
a silly hat & it's clear
whereas over here
20 years passed
that rotting hat
it's loyalty to someone or something
that's really so gone
the moment clenched
like religion or government.
Wait a minute. I prefer
umm a beatle's cap
when it's really really old
neighborhood devoted to that.

Poetry is a sentimental act
everything spring she said
being surrounded by so much rot.
Pages & pages
mounds of them that I'm in
not some library but in your
little home, like you.
Every season I know I'm leaving
I'm as loyal as the cross
to this smeltering eccentricity
down by the river with Daddio
toss your ball in the river
in the future over bridges
they say you have to imagine
the 20th century. All these buildings were colored
a blasted interior
scarlet curtains rattling day
cobwebs on inexplicable machinery
a theater once dwelled here
all I see is rotting ideas
the epics I imagined
the unified cast of everyone
eating turkey together
on a stage
my idea
like waters towers popping up
feeling mellow
not exactly nothing all this time
but the buildings that are absolute
gone that I never
described. You can't kill 
a poet. We just get erased &
written on. It aches in
my brain, my back
this beauty I'm eating my toast
everyone I knew you would
be dead tomorrow
& you were. The composing camera
infatuated with the shovel
on the lid & the pile
of rocks. He is not aging
same Alexandrian
blond in Bini-bons
the sirens are gods
when I lifted my head
from my swarming difficulty
You were so marvelous
bringing those toys to my feet
in between the invisibility of
the constant production & consumption
the network of that
& apart from the mold.
You survived.





The Double Image
 

1. 

I am thirty this November. 
You are still small, in your fourth year. 
We stand watching the yellow leaves go queer, 
flapping in the winter rain, 
falling flat and washed. And I remember 
mostly the three autumns you did not live here. 
They said I'd never get you back again. 
I tell you what you'll never really know: 
all the medical hypothesis 
that explained my brain will never be as true as these 
struck leaves letting go. 

I, who chose two times 
to kill myself, had said your nickname 
the mewling months when you first came; 
until a fever rattled 
in your throat and I moved like a pantomime 
above your head. Ugly angels spoke to me. The blame, 
I heard them say, was mine. They tattled 
like green witches in my head, letting doom 
leak like a broken faucet; 
as if doom had flooded my belly and filled your bassinet, 
an old debt I must assume. 

Death was simpler than I'd thought. 
The day life made you well and whole 
I let the witches take away my guilty soul. 
I pretended I was dead 
until the white men pumped the poison out, 
putting me armless and washed through the rigamarole 
of talking boxes and the electric bed. 
I laughed to see the private iron in that hotel. 
Today the yellow leaves 
go queer. You ask me where they go. I say today believed 
in itself, or else it fell. 

Today, my small child, Joyce, 
love your self's self where it lives. 
There is no special God to refer to; or if there is, 
why did I let you grow 
in another place. You did not know my voice 
when I came back to call. All the superlatives 
of tomorrow's white tree and mistletoe 
will not help you know the holidays you had to miss. 
The time I did not love 
myself, I visited your shoveled walks; you held my glove. 
There was new snow after this. 


2. 

They sent me letters with news 
of you and I made moccasins that I would never use. 
When I grew well enough to tolerate 
myself, I lived with my mother. Too late,
too late, to live with your mother, the witches said. 
But I didn't leave. I had my portrait 
done instead. 

Part way back from Bedlam 
I came to my mother's house in Gloucester, 
Massachusetts. And this is how I came 
to catch at her; and this is how I lost her. 
I cannot forgive your suicide, my mother said. 
And she never could. She had my portrait 
done instead. 

I lived like an angry guest, 
like a partly mended thing, an outgrown child. 
I remember my mother did her best. 
She took me to Boston and had my hair restyled. 
Your smile is like your mother's, the artist said. 
I didn't seem to care. I had my portrait 
done instead. 

There was a church where I grew up 
with its white cupboards where they locked us up, 
row by row, like puritans or shipmates 
singing together. My father passed the plate. 
Too late to be forgiven now, the witches said. 
I wasn't exactly forgiven. They had my portrait 
done instead. 


3. 

All that summer sprinklers arched 
over the seaside grass. 
We talked of drought 
while the salt-parched 
field grew sweet again. To help time pass 
I tried to mow the lawn 
and in the morning I had my portrait done, 
holding my smile in place, till it grew formal. 
Once I mailed you a picture of a rabbit 
and a postcard of Motif number one, 
as if it were normal 
to be a mother and be gone. 

They hung my portrait in the chill 
north light, matching 
me to keep me well. 
Only my mother grew ill. 
She turned from me, as if death were catching, 
as if death transferred, 
as if my dying had eaten inside of her. 
That August you were two, but I timed my days with doubt. 
On the first of September she looked at me 
and said I gave her cancer. 
They carved her sweet hills out 
and still I couldn't answer. 


4. 

That winter she came 
part way back 
from her sterile suite 
of doctors, the seasick 
cruise of the X-ray, 
the cells' arithmetic 
gone wild. Surgery incomplete, 
the fat arm, the prognosis poor, I heard 
them say. 

During the sea blizzards 
she had here 
own portrait painted. 
A cave of mirror 
placed on the south wall; 
matching smile, matching contour. 
And you resembled me; unacquainted 
with my face, you wore it. But you were mine 
after all. 

I wintered in Boston, 
childless bride, 
nothing sweet to spare 
with witches at my side. 
I missed your babyhood, 
tried a second suicide, 
tried the sealed hotel a second year. 
On April Fool you fooled me. We laughed and this 
was good. 


5. 

I checked out for the last time 
on the first of May; 
graduate of the mental cases, 
with my analyst's okay, 
my complete book of rhymes, 
my typewriter and my suitcases. 

All that summer I learned life 
back into my own 
seven rooms, visited the swan boats, 
the market, answered the phone, 
served cocktails as a wife 
should, made love among my petticoats 

and August tan. And you came each 
weekend. But I lie. 
You seldom came. I just pretended 
you, small piglet, butterfly 
girl with jelly bean cheeks, 
disobedient three, my splendid 

stranger. And I had to learn 
why I would rather 
die than love, how your innocence 
would hurt and how I gather 
guilt like a young intern 
his symptoms, his certain evidence. 

That October day we went 
to Gloucester the red hills 
reminded me of the dry red fur fox 
coat I played in as a child; stock-still 
like a bear or a tent, 
like a great cave laughing or a red fur fox. 

We drove past the hatchery, 
the hut that sells bait, 
past Pigeon Cove, past the Yacht Club, past Squall's 
Hill, to the house that waits 
still, on the top of the sea, 
and two portraits hung on the opposite walls. 


6. 

In north light, my smile is held in place, 
the shadow marks my bone. 
What could I have been dreaming as I sat there, 
all of me waiting in the eyes, the zone 
of the smile, the young face, 
the foxes' snare. 

In south light, her smile is held in place, 
her cheeks wilting like a dry 
orchid; my mocking mirror, my overthrown 
love, my first image. She eyes me from that face, 
that stony head of death 
I had outgrown. 

The artist caught us at the turning; 
we smiled in our canvas home 
before we chose our foreknown separate ways. 
The dry red fur fox coat was made for burning. 
I rot on the wall, my own 
Dorian Gray. 

And this was the cave of the mirror, 
that double woman who stares 
at herself, as if she were petrified 
in time -- two ladies sitting in umber chairs. 
You kissed your grandmother 
and she cried. 


7. 

I could not get you back 
except for weekends. You came 
each time, clutching the picture of a rabbit 
that I had sent you. For the last time I unpack 
your things. We touch from habit. 
The first visit you asked my name. 
Now you stay for good. I will forget 
how we bumped away from each other like marionettes 
on strings. It wasn't the same 
as love, letting weekends contain 
us. You scrape your knee. You learn my name, 
wobbling up the sidewalk, calling and crying. 
You call me mother and I remember my mother again, 
somewhere in greater Boston, dying. 

I remember we named you Joyce 
so we could call you Joy. 
You came like an awkward guest 
that first time, all wrapped and moist 
and strange at my heavy breast. 
I needed you. I didn't want a boy, 
only a girl, a small milky mouse 
of a girl, already loved, already loud in the house 
of herself. We named you Joy. 
I, who was never quite sure 
about being a girl, needed another 
life, another image to remind me. 
And this was my worst guilt; you could not cure 
nor soothe it. I made you to find me.





Portrait of an Old Woman on the College Tavern Wall
 

   Oh down at the tavern
the children are singing
around their round table
and around me still.
Did you hear what it said?

                   I only said
how there is a pewter urn
pinned to the tavern wall,
as old as old is able
to be and be there still.
I said, the poets are there
I hear them singing and lying
around their round table
and around me still.
Across the room is a wreath
made of a corpse's hair,
framed in glass on the wall,
as old as old is able
to be and be remembered still.
Did you hear what it said?

                  I only said
how I want to be there and I
would sing my songs with the liars
and my lies with all the singers.
And I would, and I would but
it's my hair in the hair wreath,
my cup pinned to the tavern wall,
my dusty face they sing beneath.
Poets are sitting in my kitchen.
Why do these poets lie?
Why do children get children and
Did you hear what it said?

                  I only said
how I want to be there,
Oh, down at the tavern
where the prophets are singing
around their round table
until they are still.






The Expatriates
 

My dear, it was a moment
to clutch at for a moment
so that you may believe in it
and believing is the act of love, I think,
even in the telling, wherever it went.

In the false New England forest
where the misplanted Norwegian trees
refused to root, their thick synthetic
roots barging out of the dirt to work on the air,
we held hands and walked on our knees.
Actually, there was no one there.

For forty years this experimental
woodland grew, shaft by shaft in perfect rows
where its stub branches held and its spokes fell.
It was a place of parallel trees, their lives
filed out in exile where we walked too alien to know
our sameness and how our sameness survives.

Outside of us the village cars followed
the white line we had carefully walked
two nights before toward our single beds.
We lay halfway up an ugly hill and if we fell
it was here in the woods where the woods were caught
in their dying and you held me well.

And now I must dream the forest whole
and your sweet hands, not once as frozen
as those stopped trees, nor ruled, nor pale,
nor leaving mine. Today, in my house, I see
our house, its pillars a dim basement of men
holding up their foreign ground for you and me.

My dear, it was a time,
butchered from time
that we must tell of quickly
before we lose the sound of our own
mouths calling mine, mine, mine.






The Operation
 

1.

After the sweet promise,
the summer's mild retreat
from mother's cancer, the winter months of her death,
I come to this white office, its sterile sheet,
its hard tablet, its stirrups, to hold my breath
while I, who must, allow the glove its oily rape,
to hear the almost mighty doctor over me equate
my ills with hers
and decide to operate.

It grew in her
as simply as a child would grow,
as simply as she housed me once, fat and female.
Always my most gentle house before that embryo
of evil spread in her shelter and she grew frail.
Frail, we say, remembering fear, that face we wear
in the room of the special smells of dying, fear
where the snoring mouth gapes
and is not dear.

There was snow everywhere.
Each day I grueled through
its sloppy peak, its blue-struck days, my boots
slapping into the hospital halls, past the retinue
of nurses at the desk, to murmur in cahoots
with hers outside her door, to enter with the outside
air stuck on my skin, to enter smelling her pride,
her upkeep, and to lie
as all who love have lied.

No reason to be afraid,
my almost mighty doctor reasons.
I nod, thinking that woman's dying
must come in seasons,
thinking that living is worth buying.
I walk out, scuffing a raw leaf,
kicking the clumps of dead straw
that were this summer's lawn.
Automatically I get in my car,
knowing the historic thief
is loose in my house
and must be set upon.


2.

Clean of the body's hair,
I lie smooth from breast to leg.
All that was special, all that was rare
is common here. Fact: death too is in the egg.
Fact: the body is dumb, the body is meat.
And tomorrow the O.R. Only the summer was sweet.

The rooms down the hall are calling
all night long, while the night outside
sucks at the trees. I hear limbs falling
and see yellow eyes flick in the rain. Wide eyed
and still whole I turn in my bin like a shorn lamb.
A nurse's flashlight blinds me to see who I am.

The walls color in a wash
of daylight until the room takes its objects
into itself again. I smoke furtively and squash
the butt and hide it with my watch and other effects.
The halls bustle with legs. I smile at the nurse
who smiles for the morning shift. Day is worse.

Scheduled late, I cannot drink
or eat, except for yellow pills
and a jigger of water. I wait and think
until she brings two mysterious needles: the skills
she knows she knows, promising, soon you'll be out.
But nothing is sure. No one. I wait in doubt.

I wait like a kennel of dogs
jumping against their fence. At ten
she returns, laughs and catalogues
my resistance to drugs. On the stretcher, citizen
and boss of my own body still, I glide down the halls
and rise in the iron cage toward science and pitfalls.

The great green people stand
over me; I roll on the table
under a terrible sun, following their command
to curl, head touching knee if I am able.
Next, I am hung up like a saddle and they begin.
Pale as an angel I float out over my own skin.

I soar in hostile air
over the pure women in labor,
over the crowning heads of babies being born.
I plunge down the backstair
calling mother at the dying door,
to rush back to my own skin, tied where it was torn.
Its nerves pull like wires
snapping from the leg to the rib.
Strangers, their faces rolling lilke hoops, require
my arm. I am lifted into my aluminum crib.


3.

Skull flat, here in my harness,
thick with shock, I call mother
to help myself, call toe to frog,
that woolly bat, that tongue of dog;
call God help and all the rest.
The soul that swam the furious water
sinks now in flies and the brain
flops like a docked fish and the eyes
are flat boat decks riding out the pain.

My nurses, those starchy ghosts,
hover over me for my lame hours
and my lame days. The mechanics
of the body pump for their tricks.
I rest on their needles, am dosed
and snoring amid the orange flowers
and the eyes of visitors. I wear,
like some senile woman, a scarlet
candy package ribbon in my hair.

Four days from home I lurk on my
mechanical parapet with two pillows
at my elbows, as soft as praying cushions.
My knees work with the bed that runs
on power. I grumble to forget the lie
I ought to hear, but don't. God knows
I thought I'd die--but here I am,
recalling mother, the sound of her
good morning, the odor of orange and jam.

All's well, they say. They say I'm better.
I lounge in frills or, picturesque,
I wear bunny pink slippers in the hall.
I read a new book and shuffle past the desk
to mail the author my first fan letter.
Time now to pack this humpty-dumpty
back the frightened way she came
and run along, Anne, and run along now,
my stomach laced like a football 
for the game.





Venus and the Ark
 

The missile to launch a missile
was almost a secret.
Two male Ph.D.'s were picked
and primed to fill it
and one hundred
carefully counted insects,
three almost new snakes,
coiled in a cube,
exactly fifty fish creatures
in tanks, the necessary files,
twenty bars of food, ten brief cures,
special locks, fourteen white rats,
fourteen black rats, a pouch of dirt,
were all stuffed aboard before
the thing blasted from the desert.

And the missile that launched
a missile launched out
into a marvelous scientific balloon
that rolled and bobbed about
in the mists of Venus; suddenly
sank like a sweet fat grape,
oozing past gravity to snuggle
down upon the triumphant shape
of space. The two men signaled
Earth, telling their Continent
VENUS IS GREEN. And parades assembled,
the loud earth tellers spent
all fifteen minutes on it, even
shortened their weather forecast.
But rival nations, angry and oily,
fired up their best atom blast
and the last Earth war was done.
The place became crater on each side,
sank down to its first skull,
shedding forests, oceans, dried 
bones and neons, as it fell through
time like a forgotten pitted stone.

These two men walked hopefully out
onto their hot empty planet
with machines, rats, tanks,
boxes, insects and the one odd set
of three almost new snakes,
to make the tests they were meant to do.
But on the seventh month the cages
grew small, too small to interview,
too tight to bear. The rats were gray 
and heavy things where they ran
against wire and the snakes built eggs
on eggs and even the fish began
to bump in water as they spawned
on every side of each other's swim.
And the men grew listless; they opened
the pouch of dirt, undid each locked bin
and let every creature loose
to live on Venus, or anyhow hide
under rocks. Bees swarmed the air,
letting a warm pollen slide
from their wings and onto the grass.
The fish flapped to a small pool
and the rats untangled their hairs
and humped over the vestibule
of the cramped balloon. Trees sprang
from lichen, the rock became a park,
where, even at star-time, things brushed;
even in the planet's new dark
crotch, that air snag where snakes
coupled and rats rubbed in disrepair,
it grew quick and noisy with
a kind of wonder in the lonely air.

Old and withered, two Ph.D.'s
from Earth hobbled slowly back
to their empty balloon, crying alone
for sense, for the troubling lack
of something they ought to do,
while countless fish slapped
and the waters grew, green came
taller and the happy rats sped
through integrated forests,
barking like dogs at the top
of the sky. But the two men,
that last morning of death, before
the first of light, watched the land
of Venus, its sweetless shore,
and thought, "This is the end.
This is the last of a man like me.
Until they saw, over the mists
of Venus, two fish creatures stop
on spangled legs and crawl
from the belly of the sea.
And from the planet park
they heard the new fruit drop.





Many in the Darkness
 

November 1941
We sat in the park, but there was a war between us,
A dead moon over us and all around us
The shy and secret whisperings as of the tiny 
Woods animals which in the high forest gather
Wind-fallen goods before the frost comes.

      We praised as lucky all whose sure existence 
      (As of the careless moon, the dutiless squirrels)
      Is not responsible for human history--
      Feeling how our happiness, how hope must mount
      Machine guns which other men yet have the firing of,
      How liberty is seen in the form of a fighter plane
      Millions look up asking, Is it ours?

Our despair was temporary but not less painful.
Over us the moon was quiet about its business,
Pouring its constant light upon the naked beaches. 
The squirrels built up their small defenses
Obliged to the fulfillment of a natural process.
Their leaf-lined cell, the brilliance of the moon,
The winter cannot touch and no touch tarnish.





The Dialectics of Love
 

1.

Under barley leaf and clover,
Lying cold, the faithless lover
Learns at last an amity
Which allows conformity.
Rocks and tree roots cabin him?
They will teach him discipline.
The rich and heavy turf above,
Closer press than any lover.
Virginal mortality
Closer than himself shall lie,
And all the weathers of his body bear
The frozen rigor of the winding year.

2.

Between brother Dexter and cousin Sinister
Frontiers are open toward the human winter, 
And civil war in every sector
Murders, fidelity's frail perspective;
In the lover's counties, the hunting heart
Is haggard wherever desires start--
In his own nets is that bright hawk taken,
A willing captive, the old ties broken.
And fearful lovers all complain
The strict modality of change;
Feeling in all their ordered parts
The rebel soviets rising up,
They cry, "I am not; be not false--
When each day finds them someone else:
Whom every hour creates anew--
He must seem false who would be true.

3.

What love the year shows to the spring
By autumn grows another thing.
And yet each season has its part
In the weathers of that impersonal heart:
The summer bourgeois revolution
Offers morality's pale solution--
Over the public eye and lip
The seal of personal ownership;
Prepares the realm for civil war
When right hand and left divided are
And the split heart cannot love the more
Public virgin or private whore. 
Our of these warring opposites
Arises the needed synthesis:
At nodal points the personal love
Changes, if it is pure enough,
From single idol in man or woman
To equal love for all that's human.
And even in death the faithful lover
Under barley leaf or clover
His mating body still must share
With the transience of the winding year. 






Such Simple Love
 

All night long I hear the sleepers toss
Between the darkened window and the wall.
The madman's whimper and the lover's voice,
The worker's whisper and the sick child's call--
Knowing them all

I'd walk a mile, maybe, hearing some cat
Crying its guts out, to throttle it by hand,
Such simple love I had. I wished I might--
Or God might--answer each call in person and
Each poor demand.

Well, I'd have been better off sleeping myself.
These fancies had some sentimental charm,
But love without direction is a cheap blanket
And even if it did no one any harm,
No one is warm.





The Little Odyssey of Jason Quint, of Science, Doctor
 

1.

Betrayed by his five mechanic agents, falling
Captive to consciousness, he summons light
To all its duties, and assumes the world
Like a common penance. Rust on the green tongue burns
Like history's corrosive on his living tree.
But all the monsters of his sleep's dark sea
Are tame familiars in the morning sun.

2.

He sees the nation browse across burnt miles
Of toast, toward the time-clock. Deafened, hears
A Gettysburg of breakfast food explode
Against the surd tympanum of the air.
The roads outside to No-and-Any Where
Trigger all space-time to a zero Now.
The punctual goddess blossoms on his brow--
Pragmatic emblem of the daylit need. 

3.

Now with his thought the rank and maundy world
(That lost between quanta and mechanic wave
All pulp and passion sprawls around the globe). 
He stiffens, as a hand informs a glove,
And drags each lank potential into form.
Thus the hieratic arrow of his glance
Creates St. Sebastian Avenue Street Place--
All of sublunary circumstance 
Crowds on the casual platform of his gaze.

4.

Like money sealed in a pneumatic tube
He whirls beneath the city's stony floor
To where the cold coordinates of work
Advance their cross-hairs on the target hour.
There surplus value's mathematic flower
(All X squared Y squared like a tesseract
Or ghostly dirigible) grows unseen
Across the lean dimension of in fact.

5. 

Grows all unseen as Jason Quint pursues
The windy hazard of the Absolute
Through icy tundras, farther than the Horn,
Vaster than Asia in their wuthering snows.
The sweat of progress and humanity
Colors no litmus in those latitudes;
In a rustle of banknotes and casualty lists
The Bomb is shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.

6.

The quitting whistle lofts a flag of truce,
And all hope's flutes and harpsichords compound
The lonely leisure. The Great Nocturnal Drift
Sets to its Deep. He walks the park. Profound
Unease returns to Quint. The sleepy lathes
Of hummingbirds machine the emerald
Of garden silence which his feet confuse.
The statues hoist, on labyrinthine paths,
The mineral grandeur of a public smile.

7. 

And the world goes blank, and heavy as a stone
Rolls into night. It is the human hour.
Imperfect. Lovers, food and politics
Command the air, and Jason Quint alone,
Clothed in abstraction, like a bush that burns
In the blind frequencies where none may pass,
Stalks through that only country of the poor--
The lamplit hour the quitting whistle mourns.

8.

Imperfect. The stability of dextrous stars 
Offers him comfort, but their light is cold.
A storm of sentiment, sudden as a could
Of migrant birds, sings in his head. Now stirs
The terrible friend, companion of his dreams,
With his emotional algebra of need and loss--
The hateful witness to his mortal part 
And confirmation of his loneliness.





The Progress of the Soul
 

Where once I loved my flesh,
That social fellow,
Now I want security of bone
And cherish the silence of my skeleton. 

Where once I walked the world
Hunting the devil,
Now I find the darkness and the void
Within my side.

First to be good, then to be happy I
Worked and prayed.
Before the midnight, like the foul fiend,
I killed my dear friend.

Hope unto hope, dream beyond monstrous dream
I sought the world.
Now, at the black pitch and midnight of despair,
I find it was always here.





Gone Away Blues
 

Sirs, when you are in your last extremity,
When your admirals are drowning in the grass-green sea,
When your generals are preparing the total catastrophe--
I just want you to know how you can not count on me.

      I have ridden to hounds through my ancestral halls,
      I have picked the eternal crocus on the ultimate hill,
      I have fallen through the window of the highest room,
      But don't ask me to help you 'cause I never will.

Sirs, when you move that map-pin how many souls must dance?
I don't think all those soldiers have died by happenstance.
The inscrutable look on your scrutable face I can read at a glance--
And I'm cutting out of here at the first chance.

     I have been wounded climbing the second stair,
     I have crossed the ocean in the hull of a live wire,
     I have eaten the asphodel of the dark side of the moon,
     But you can call me all day and I just won't hear.

O patriotic mister with your big ear to the ground,
Sweet old curly scientist wiring the birds for sound,
O lady with the Steuben glass heart and your heels so rich and round--
I'll sent you a picture postcard from somewhere I can't be found.

      I have discovered the grammar of the Public Good,
      I have invented a language that can be understood,
      I have found the map of where the body is hid,
      And I won't be caught dead in your neighborhood.

O hygienic inventer of the bomb that's so clean,
O lily white Senator from East Turnip Green,
O celestial mechanic of the money machine--
I'm going someplace where nobody makes your scene.

      Good-by, good-by, good-by,
      Adios, au 'voir, so long,
      Sayonara, dosvedanya, ciao,
      By-by, by-by, by-by.






A Romance
 

I saw a child set down her binder like a wall
through the candy bin at the Corner Luncheonette
so she could scoop out gum while she spoke to the clerk--

and from that moment was in love: Oh theft.

College was supposed to straighten me
like a bent tree strangled by a wire,
but being done with sweetness I could not resist the lure of meat.

How the red muscle gleamed in its shiny wrap,
a wedge that had once been the thigh or the loin
of a slow brute's body, sugar-dirt and clotted grass 

to be snatched in an instant
and zipped into the crone-y-est of pocketbooks.
Radiance housed in rawhide again, as when it was living.

A steak can be stuck in your jeans when you're skinny,
a rump roast is right for a puffy down coat,
small chops will fit under a thin peasant blouse

where it falls off the breasts
like a woodland rive
with a limestone amphitheater underneath.

Ancient city, ancient sublet, ancient wooden fire escape--
with my other bandits I learned to say how-de-do in French.
We were yanking on the cord that would start the motor of our lives

though we did not have the choke adjusted yet.

Sometimes it seemed I floated in the dregs like a tea bag
bloating up with facts.
Until a girl ran in the door, panting hard, face red,

slab thudding
from her snowflake-damasked waist onto the table,
and we stood around it gawking at the way it seemed to breathe.






Found Object
 

Somebody left this white T-shirt
like a hangman's hood on the new parking meter--
the magic marks upon its back say: I QUIT METH 4-EVER. 
A declaration to the sky, whose angels all wear seagull wings
swooping over this street with its torn scratch tickets
and Big Gulp cups dropped by the curb.

Extra large, it has been customized
with a pocketknife or a canine tooth
to rough the armholes where my boobs wobble out
as I roam these rooms lit by twilight's bulb,
feeling half like Bette Davis in a wheelchair
and half like that Hell's Angels kingpin with the tracheotomy.

Dear reader, do you know that guy?
I didn't think so. If only we could all watch the same TV.
But no doubt you have seen the gulls flying,
and also the sinister bulked-up crows
carrying white clouds of hotdog buns in their beaks:
you can promise them you'll straighten up, but they are such big cynics.

I should have told you My lotto #'s 2-11-19-23-36
is what's written in front, beside the silk screen
for Listerine Cool Mint PocketPaks--
which means you can't hijack my name;
no, you have to go find your own, like a Hopi brave.
You might have to sit in a sweat lodge until you pass out

or eat a weird vine and it will not be pleasant. Your pulse
goes staccato like a Teletype machine-- then blam
you'll be transformed into your post-larval being.
Maybe swallowtail, maybe moth: trust me, I know
because once I was a baby blue convertible
but now I'm this black hot rod painted with flames.






IN VITRO/IN VIVO
 

Only once did the frog come to mind: when the coroner
came to "first-aid training at the fire station,
his slide carousel set up to eliminate
the easy pukers. The frog was not dead
but its brain had been pithed, which is what happens
when you stick a probe into the skull and wiggle.
You wind up with something dead enough
to let you stretch its tongue as thin and wide
as a cellophane sheet, which I did so
eagerly, back in the lab. The coroner said:
Here is the fat guy whose Chihuahua 
gnawed through his stomach. Click.
Here is the farmer who hanged himself in his silo.
(I noted his foreshortened dangling feet.) Click.
It had been thrilling to see the frog's blood cells
jerking through the narrow capillaries. Here
is the woman who swallowed the bottle of Drano.
Click. Here is the man who just Sawzall-ed
his neck clean through. Click. Here is the guy 
who shot off his head, but wait: he's still living,
which is what happens if the brain stem's left intact.
Click. The coroner said we should aim for the base
not the top of the skull and remember to turn down
the heat. Click. There are many people in this world
on whom nobody checks in very often. Click. 
The warmer the room, the quicker a body
will turn black and bloat. Click.
If you have a dog it is important to leave out
what seems like an inordinate amount of dog food.
Click, click, then there was nothing 
but a slab of light to signal he was through.
And it was then that I remembered the frog,
not that the coroner had spoken of frogs.
What he said was,
If we saw the cops outside, smoking cigars,
that's when we'd know we had a stinker.






Two of the Furies
 

The old woman in the parking lot
wields her walker not unspryly. Gray hair
lank and without style, hanging
under her ski hat, as I wear a ski hat--
her legs bare under her skirt,
my legs bare under my skirt,
she wears sneakers, I wear sneakers--
windbreaker, windbreaker. She rolls up
to watch me board, as people do,
because it is interesting
to see the wheelchair maneuvered backward
into the van. You got it?
she asks, as people do
though I am not their child.
We are not sisters either, 
despite the wind's ruffling our skirts in sync--
oh how she is interested in the ruffling of my skirt.
The ruffle makes her giddy, starts
her bald gums racing on their wordless observations
as she peers into my thighs. 
How alike we are! says this
no-sister of mine to be argued with,
just some crazy old woman 
flashing the terrible crater of her smile
to raise the wind and
prove her point.






Transcendentalism
 

The professor stabbed his chest with his hands curled like forks
before coughing up the question
that had dogged him since he first read Emerson:
Why am I "I? Like musk oxen we hunkered
while his lecture drifted against us like snow.
If we could, we would have turned our backs into the wind.

I felt bad about his class's being such a snoozefest, though peaceful too,
a quiet little interlude from everyone outside
rooting up the corpse of literature
for being too Caucasian. There was a simple answer
to my own question (how come no one loved me,
stomping on the pedals of my little bicycle):

I was insufferable. So, too, was Emerson I bet,
though I liked If the red slayer think he slays--
the professor drew a giant eyeball to depict the Over-soul.
Then he read a chapter from his own book:
naptime.
He didn't care if our heads tipped forward on their stalks.

When spring came, he even threw us a picnic in his yard
where dogwood bloomed despire a few last 
dirty bergs of snow. He was a wounded animal
being chased across the tundra by those wolves,
the postmodernists. At any moment
you expected to see blood come dripping through his clothes. 

And I am I who never understood his question,
though he let me climb to take a seat
aboard the wooden scow he'd been building in the shade
of thirty-odd years. How I ever rowed it
from his yard, into my life--remains a mystery.
The work is hard because the eyeball's heavy, riding in the bow.





Poem
 

I don't belong in this century--who does?
In my time, summer came someplace in June--
The cutbanks blazing with roses, the birds brazen, and the astonished
Pastures frisking with young calves . . .
                                                          That was in the country--
I don't mean another country, I mean in the country:
And the country is lost. I don't mean just lost to me,
Nor in the way of metaphorical loss--it's lost that way too--
No; nor in no sort of special case: I mean
Lost.

Now, down below, in the fire and stench, the city
Is building its shell: elaborate levels of emptiness
Like some sea-animal building toward its extinction.
And the citizens, unserious and full of virtue,
Are hunting for bread, or money, or a prayer,
And I behold them, and this season of man, without love.

If it were not a joke, it would be proper to laugh.
--Curious how that rat's nest holds together--
Distracting . . .
                      Without it there might be, still,
The gold wheel and the silver, the sun and the moon,
The season's ancient assurance under the unstable stars
Our fiery companions . . .
                                     And trees, perhaps, and the sound
Of the wild and living water hurrying out of the hills.

Without these, I have you for my talisman:
Sun, moon, the four seasons,
The true voice of the mountains. Now be
(The city revolving in its empty shell,
The night moving in from the East)
--Be thou these things.





Passage
 

for John Coltrane

Words
      after all
are syllables just
and you put them
     in their place
     notes
     sounds
a painter using his stroke
     so the spot
where the article
     an umbrella
     a knife
we could find
     in its most intricate
     hiding
slashed as it was with color
     called "being
     or even "it

Expressions

For the moment just
     when the syllables
     out of their webs float

We were just
     beginning to hear
like a crane hoisted into
     the fine thin air
that had a little ache (or soft crackle)

     golden staffed edge of
     quick Mercury
     the scale runner

Envoi

     C'est juste
     your umbrella colorings
dense as telephone
     voice 
     humming down the line
     polyphonic

Red plumaged birds
     not so natural
     complicated wings
                              French!

Sweet difficult passages 
                              on your throats
there just there
                              caterpillar edging
                              to moth
Midnight
                              in the chrome attic






20
 

Sleep is 20
                    remembering the
insignificant flamenco dancer
in Granada
                    who became
important as you watched
the mountain ridge
                    the dry hills

What an idiotic number!

Sleep is twenty

it certainly isn't twenty sheep
there weren't that many in the herd
under the cold crest of Sierra Nevada

It's more like 20 Madison Ave. buses
while I go droning away at my dream life
Each episode is important
that's what it is! Sequences --
I've got going a twenty-act drama
the theatre of the active
the critics are surely there
even the actors
even the flowers presented onstage
even the wild flowers
picked by the wife of the goatherd
each morning early (while I sleep)
under the snow cone
of Sierra Nevada

                    yellow caps like castanets
                    I reach into my bouquet
                    half-dreaming
                    and count twenty
                    yellow capped heads

flowers clicking twenty times
because they like to repeat themselves

as I do as does the morning
or the drama one hopes
will be acted many times

As even these dreams in similar
people's heads

                         20 
      
                     castanets






Barrels
 

Y otras pasan; y vindome tan triste,toman un poquito de tien la abrupta arruga de mi hondo dolor.                                   Cesar Vellejo

I won't let anybody
take a drink
out of this barrel of tears
I've collected from you.

Least of all another woman.

I see her coming along.
I know the type. 
I can tell you what she'll 
be wearing.

I know the type
I won't like it.

She'll look at that barrel
she's had a few in her day.

Not that she's ever filled one.

She'll remark casually,
"Sweet water,
good to wash my hair.

And who doesn't know
tears are purer
than rain water
and softer on the hair.

Just as she steps toward it
and makes for the cup,
I'll see phantom you
and what you were
brought up by the sea.

And scraps of paper
from this ditch of my brain
will float on the water
and choke her.





Eating Chocolate Ice Cream: Reading Mayakovsky
 

Since I've decided to revolutionize my life
                       since
                                  
                       decided
                                           
                       revolutionize
                                           
                       life        
                                           
                                       
How early it is! It is eight o'clock in the morning.
Well, the pigeons were up earlier
Did you eat all your egg?
Now we shall go for a long walk.
Now? There is too much winter.
I am going to admire the snow on your coat.
Time for hot soup, already?
You have worked for three solid hours.
I have written forty-eight, no forty-nine,
no fifty-one poems.
How many states are there?
I cannot remember what is uniting America.
It is then time for your nap.
What a lovely, pleasant dream I just had.
But I like waking up better.
I do admire reality like snow on my coat.
Would you take cream or lemon in your tea?
No sugar?
And no cigarettes.
Daytime is good, but evening is better.
I do like our evening discussions.
Yesterday we talked about Kant.
Today let's think about Hegel.
In another week we shall have reached Marx.
Goody. 
Life is a joy if one has industrious hands.
Supper? Stew and well-cooked. Delicious.
Well, perhaps just one more glass of milk.
Nine o'clock! Bath time!
Soap and a clean rough towel.
Bedtime!
The Red Army is marching tonight.
They shall march through my dreams
in their new shiny leather boots,
their freshly laundered shirts.
All those ugly stains of caviar and champagne
and kisses
have been rubbed away.
They are going to the barracks.
They are answering hundreds of pink
and yellow and blue and white telephones.
How happy and contented and well-fed they look
lounging on their fur divans,
chanting, "Russia how kind you are to us.
How kind you are to everybody. 
We want to live forever.
Before I wake up they will throw away
their pistols, and magically
factories will spring up where once
there was rifle fire, a roulette factory,
where once a body fell from an open window.
Hurry dear dream
I am waiting for you
under the eiderdown.
And tomorrow will be more real, perhaps,
than yesterday.






A Reason
 

That is why I am here
not among the ibises. Why
the permanent city parasol
covers even me.

             It was the rains
in the occult season. It was the snows
on the lower slopes. It was water
and cold in my mouth.

            A lack of shoes
on what appeared to be cobbles
which were still antique

           Well wild wild whatever
in wild more silent blue
 
           the vase grips the stems
petals fall    the chrysanthemum darkens

           Sometimes this mustard feeling
clutches me also. My sleep is reckoned 
in straws

            Yet I wake up
and am followed into the street.





Things
 

What happened is, we grew lonely
living among the things,
so we gave the clock a face,
the chair a back,
the table four stout legs
which will never suffer fatigue.

We fitted our shoes with tongues
as smooth as our own
and hung tongues inside bells
so we could listen
to their emotional language,

and because we loved graceful profiles
the pitcher received a lip,
the bottle a long, slender neck.

Even what was beyond us
was recast in our image;
we gave the country a heart,
the storm an eye,
the cave a mouth
so we could pass into safety.





One Night in Balthazar
 

The hotel bar downstairs
was dirty and dark and almost empty
except for him whom I didn't know

I lost my balance 
because evil is aroused by absence


Outside on the island
a brick city had grown up and old

A person could only nibble on its shadows


Where was my beloved?

The cornerstone was familiar
but unrecognizable
and I didn't understand why infinity 

was seeping into my hair



Somebody said:
"He's out of his bottle

I guess it meant
Temporarily out of service and empty.

But then there was Arsene
beside the last remaining cabin
wandering with his eyes on the camera


Dynamite in his pocket
and a piece of thread

to trap a rabbit.


Evil is a growing thing
It has its own gravity
and never answers to its name
It is a hole into chaos. It is real

Arsene held me in his arms
He was drunk as usual
and his nipple smelled of rum

But still I loved him--
loved him madly!--
as if he was the one






Night Flight
 

I am doing laps at night, alone 
In the indoor pool. Outside 
It is snowing, but I am warm 
And weightless, suspended and out 
Of time like a fly in amber. 
 
She is thousands of miles 
From here, and miles above me, 
Ghosting the stratosphere, 
Heading from New York to London. 
Though it is late, even 
At that height, I know her light 
Is on, her window a square 
Of gold as she reads mysteries 
Above the Atlantic. I watch 
 
The line of black tile on the pool's 
Floor, leading me down the lane. 
If she looks down by moonlight, 
Under a clear sky, she will see 
Black water. She will see me 
Swimming distantly, moving far 
From shore, suspended with her 
In flight through the wide gulf 
As we swim toward land together. 






To
 

Before you were I loved you
and when you were born
and when you took your first step
Although I did not know
good luck I want to say

lone penguin keep sturdily waddling
in the direction of those frozen mountains sister
of desolate sanctity
I want to scream
Although I did not know you

I loved you later on
as just a weedy thing
a little skeleton I loved
Both long pre-you a child myself
and as a man in retrospect

I loved and I was there
while they were raping you
I loved although
like God
that's all that I could do--






Dedication
 

It's true I never write, but I would gladly die with you.
Gladly lower myself down alone with you into the enormous mouth
that waits, beyond youth, beyond every instant of ecstasy, remember:
before battle we would do each other's makeup, comb each other's
                   hair out
saying we are unconquerable, we are terrible and splendid--
the mouth waiting, patiently waiting. And I will meet you there
                   again
beyond bleeding thorns, the endless dilation, the fire that alters
                   nothing;
I am there already past snowy clouds, balding moss, dim
swarm of stars even we can step over, it is easier this time, I promise--
I am already waiting in your personal heaven, here is my hand,
I will help you across. I would gladly die with you still,
although I never write  
from this gray institution. See
they are so busy trying to cure me, 
I'm condemned--sorry, I have been given the job
of vacuuming the desert forever, well, no more than eight hours 
                   a day.
And it's really just about a thousand miles of cafeteria; 
a large one in any event. With its miniature plastic knives,
its tuna salad and Saran-Wrapped genitalia will somebody 
                   please
get me out of here, sorry. I am happy to say that
every method, massive pharmaceuticals, art therapy 
and edifying films as well as others I would prefer
not to mention--I mean, every single technique
known to the mouth--sorry!--to our most kindly
compassionate science is being employed 
to restore me to normal well-being 
and cheerful stability. I go on vacuuming
toward a small diamond light burning 
off in the distance. Remember 
me. Do you
remember me?   
In the night's windowless darkness
when I am lying cold and numb 
and no one's fiddling with the lock, or 
shining flashlights in my eyes,
although I never write, secretly 
I long to die with you,
does that count?






What Isnt Mine
 

Let us tunnel 
Through the rubble,

Through the thrum. 
Let us rut through the sum 

Of who we were, 
Or are,

Or will be in the years to come: 
A couple 

Of someones 
Who used to be in love.

Used to be in love. 
Ho. Hum.

These days: Seem to be in hate. 
Gypsum, marble, pyrite, slate.

See here. A pit of snakes.
Look there. The rock of your rages.

And I'm in a cable-cage, slinking down your shaft. 
You fondle that hefty What if. . . ? as if

To hurl it. All the other holes
Are blatant hells. 

A dragline scrapes our fossicked floor.
I am the ether. You are the ore.

This is the war that nobody won.
Like afterdamp collapsing a lung.

You take to swinging a pickaxe.
I take back my vamping kinks

And the pavement beneath us sinks.
This stinks. Think: In-situ leaching

But with leeches, louses, 
Lampreys. Oh Spouse, 

Your hard hat leaks a surfeit 
Of lamp rays that's wasted sub-surface.

A night so pitch it's perfectly black.
A sapphire scarred by a scratch.

Sickness, health, abundance, lack.
The salt in my wound. The shirt off your back.

So our bloodcup runs empty of urge.
The metallurgy

We're made of demands its dirge.
Our burrows diverge.

Our passages split.
Copper, silver, gravel, grit.

Am I--perhaps--alluvial?
Un-live-with-able? 

A bit too simple or silty?
Only gold really ought be gilty.

And you are as cold as coal.
I am your dole, your lode,

Your carbon-flawed diamond.
All told: We drilled and hit demons.

Granite, though, is good for graves. 
Granted, a mine isn't quite a cave.

What isn't mine, I cannot give.






Poem
 

A clementine
Of inclement climate
Grows tart.

A crocus
Too stoic to open,
Won't.

Like an oyster
That cloisters a spoil of pearls,
Untouched--

The heart that's had
Enough
Stays shut.






Non Redibimus
 

We shall not come again, not to this wet 
          and summer day, nor to the waylaid place
where you laid waste to me and I to you, 
          and where we reminisced recalling who
did what to whom. We shall not come again.
          Not to the bed we thrashed nor to the memory
of the way I brushed my hair back, nights,
          nor to the air we dared to share to breathe,
or couldn't quite. We shall not come again.
          No more, my face seen round your corner, or
your briefcase found beneath my table. We
          weren't able, apt or sane. We shall not come
again. Nor cry nor clutch, not even once
          again. We shall not cover up in quilts
or bear the beast of one another's guilts
          or sit in silences made saddest by
what was. We shall not come again. Because.







Song in my heart
 

If there's pee on the seat it's my pee, 
battery's dead I killed it, canary at the bottom 
of the cage I bury it, like God tromping the sky 
in his undershirt carrying his brass spittoon, 
raging and sobbing in his Hush Puppy house 
slippers with the backs broke down, no Mrs. 
God to make him reasonable as he gets out 
the straight razor to slice the hair off his face, 
using the Black Sea as a mirror when everyone 
knows the Black Sea is a terrible mirror, 
like God is a terrible simile for me but like
God with his mirror, I use it.






Advent
 

In the middle of December
to start over

to assume again
an order

at the end
of wonder

to conjure
and then to keep

slow dirty sleet
within its streetlight






True Love
 

Off rows of windshields
in the Amtrak lot
rain in sudden
clumps like jacks. Parked cars
with people in them
awaiting people they imagine
hurtling through suburbs
of silver woods 
awaiting them. True
love needs interference,
a certain blizzard distance,
for the words to worm through.
Remember Iowa?
August storms that would self-spark
as if our fights could trip
the finest wire beneath the sidewalk.
And the sunlight, harder after.






Such is the Raging
 

Or how, when last sun,
6 PM, burns off
to a few dust flakes
fluttering above the sink,

a further light will
trick its way inside
the linoleum until
each tile--such is

the raging within
unfinished things--
flickers and swims
in its own negative. 






The Gatekeepers Children
 

This is the house of the very rich.
You can tell because it's taken all
The colors and left only the spaces
Between colors where the absence
Of rage and hunger survives. If you could
Get close you could touch the embers
Of red, the tiny beaks of yellow,
That jab back, the sacred blue that mimics
The color of heaven. Behind the house
The children digging in the flower beds
Have been out there since dawn waiting
To be called in for hot chocolate or tea
Or the remnants of meals. No one can see
Them, even though children are meant
To be seen, and these are good kids
Who go on working in silence.
They're called the gatekeeper's children,
Though there is no gate nor--of course--
Any gatekeeper, but if there were
These would be his, the seven of them,
Heads bowed, knifing the earth. Is that rain,
Snow, or what smearing their vision?
Remember, in the beginning they agreed
To accept a sky that answered nothing,
They agreed to lower their eyes, to accept
The gifts the hard ground hoarded.
Even though they were only children
They agreed to draw no more breath
Than fire requires and yet never to burn.





crossword
 

a woman moves through dog rose and juniper bushes,
a pussy clean and folded between her legs,
breasts like the tips of her festive shoes
shine silently in her heavy armoire.

one blackbird, one cow, one horse.
the sea beats against the wall of the waterless. 
she walks to a phone booth that waits
a fair distance from all three villages.

it's a game she could have heard on the radio:
a question, a number, an answer, a prize.
her pussy reaches up and turns on the light in her womb.  

from the rain, she says into the receiver,
we compiled white tables and chairs under a shed 
into a crossword puzzle
and sat ourselves in the grid.

the receiver is silent. the bird flounces 
like a burglar caught red-handed. 
her voice stumbles over her glands. 
the body to be written in the last block--
i can suck his name out of any letter.

all three villages cover their faces with wind.






Jean-Paul Belmondo
 

it begins with your face of a stone
where lips repose like two seals
in a coastal mist of cigarette smoke
you move through the streets--
listing them
is as useless as naming waves.

                       (that city is so handsome for a reason--
                        it was made out of your rib)

it continues with my 
          skidmarked by a dress
body. i stand on the border
on heels like my sixth toes
and show you
where to park.

that very night
lying together 
                        in the dogs yard
       --flowers are biting my back!--
you whisper:
          the longer i look on the coins of your nipples 
          the clearer i see the Queen's profile. 

for you, body and money are the same 
as the chicken and the egg.
the metaphor of "a woman's purse 
escapes you.
stealing, you like to mumble:
a purse is a purse is a purse is a purse.
also:
a real purse in your hand is worth 
two metaphorical purses over your mouth.

they tell me 
          you are a body 
                        anchored to the shore by its rusting blood.
your wound darkens on your chest like a crow.
i tell them--as agreed--that you are my youth.
an apple that bit into me to forget its own knowledge.

death hands you every new day like a golden coin.
as the bribe grows
it gets harder to turn it down.
your heart of gold gets heavier to carry. 

your hands know that a car has a waist
and a gun--a lobe. 
you take me where the river once lifted its skirts
and God, abashed with that view,
ordered to cover that shame with a city.

its dance square
shrank by the darkness to the size
of a sleeping infant's slightly open mouth.
i cannot tell between beggars' stretched hands 
and dogs' dripping tongues.
you cannot tell between legs--
                    mine--tables'--chairs'--others'.

that dance square is a cage
where accordions grin at dismembered violin torsos.
beggars lick thin air off their lips.
women whirling in salsa slash you 
across the chest with the blades
of their skirts soiled with peonies. 





In the Gallery of the Ordinary
 

In their excess, their blowsy dreaming
and King Solomon-like tempers, the clouds
possess the grandeur of eighteenth-century oils,

when a painter earned his profession
as an anatomist. Those artists of verdigris 
and gamboge, too gorged on joy, perhaps,

treated that blank pasture of the "heavens
like something that had lived. 
Their crawly undoings remind us

of the mean curiosities of sheep, the sea's 
half-remembered boil, or a few twisted bolls 
of cotton--the morning phosphorescent

or sunset a dull, worn-out gilt.
The nights there were scumbled with light.
How could we ever have taken them

for the abstinence of art?






Amuse-Bouche
 

I miss the moshpit pushed to the side of the bed.
The hard and fast rules, the business,
Walking across town the baby's hand in mine
Gave me anxiety Rosado barely mellowed.

Who doesn't love to hear about anxiety.
You wouldn't be too wrong to wake from dreaming
Into an amusement park sluice of Rioja
Eau de post-Auden thanks a lot Timex hubbub.

Those feelings are in their way good luck.
I don't even need a communion wafer
To feel the need to broadcast imprecations
Fade like a docent as the hedge fund falls.






Ira Will Not Be Attending the Meeting
 

When working on a small scale
He is practicing a gesture.
So much of life is practicing gestures.
So much of living is evaluating
Those around you for signs of damage.

Now it is night, morning's a blink away.
Sleep is sometimes thought of
As an avalanche of repair gnomes
That attends your pit stop.
Would that we were sleeping now!

Viable alternatives will be reviled
Until the point of no return is passed.
The only reasonable course of action
Is to look for sizeable flotsam,
Redo the resume, learn a martial art.






from &: A Serial Poem
 

Such pejorative deformities of sound
Without meaningful speech or musical equipoise,
Annoyances none but hoi polloi enjoys,
Through our winding whispering galleries resound
Unwelcome, & like a tedious siege surround
Us with that ubiquitous nuisance, noise,
Which may take the shape of inflated reputation,
Able neither to stun, astonish nor astound
Those whom obscene publicity annoys,
Who prefer the decent obscurity of publication.

                                &

Regardless of the weird world's disregard,
These works may be devoted to the wastebasket
Like the forgotten forgeries of some casket
Letters, scored for posterity & scarred
By repentance. Sentenced to a futility of hard
Leisure, answer nothing but the task it
Asks, apart from any eternal return.
Perhaps a masterpiece, unmade, unmarred,
Awaits the patient skill that will unmask it.
A lifetime passes as the phrases turn.

                                &

Immured in a single-occupancy cell,
Each day indistinguishable from the next,
& nearly inextinguishable, perplexed
How all manner of things shall nevertheless be well, 
Will a celibate selfish as a shellfish spell
Out a corrupt & uncorrected text
So that each deleted syllable counts?
Solitude is helpless to dispel
Questions as exceptionably vexed
As unaccountable love's unaudited accounts.

                                &

To keep your cell the way you keep your soul, 
Untidy-minded, neither soiled nor sold
For next to nothing, a treasury of old
Notions like the notes of a piano-roll
Which cannot improvise though it knows a whole
Repertoire, what ought one to withhold?
Idiosyncrasy is nobody else's business.
Of all omens the soul provides the sole
Depository. How many oceans can it hold
In its infinite & unfathomable isness?

                                &

Sealed & secured, the contents of this room
Turned our intimate alcove into a closet
Concealed behind a dirty bookcase: was it
A conservatory or a living room,
This stanza become a catacomb or tomb
That serves as a temporary safe deposit 
Vault for your perduring lost & found
Mind, which articulately could presume
To ask of being what could cause it,
A question as unanswerable as profound.

                                &

Up the steps of imperfection we stumble & stall,
Blind upstarts, our feeble feet astray & unstable,
Panting after perfections we are no more able
To encompass than an imaginative animal.
While some describe the world as round as a ball,
Others maintain that it is flat like a table.
Its shape is immaterial, there like the air.
Better, perhaps, to be sorry than safe after all,
Seeing no security could enable
One to scale unscathed the inexorable stair. 





Because our waiters are hopeless romantics
 

              the plates are broken after just one meal: 
plates that mimic lily pads or horseshoe crabs,
              swifts' wings, 
golden koi, whirlpools, blowholes in rictus: 
              all smashed against the table's edge--

. . . also our chef eschews pepper & salt
              for violets & vespers 
& squid ink & honey from wasps
              rare lichen grown in local snow
authentic silt dark from the Nile or Tigris.

              Surely you know that poultry, if cooked right, 
will cure most common psychic ills?
              It's something to do with the feathers.

                                      

. . . but you're hungry. Come in. Sit. Taste. 
              There's breast of swan for shame.

Try a quail tart for rage,
              macaw on poached orchids for boredom.

And we serve so many other things.
              There's really nothing you can't order:
goat's feet, orange groves, prophets & smoke
              convent orphans playing violins
flavors of memory, winter & wax, angles of sun, extravagant claims . . .

              Don't worry, there's plenty--

it's a mysterious feast you attend, but it offers 
              an affable scent of the cauldron, the light of abundance poured 
over every table & marvelous barstool    
Come in--

                                      

Now you're getting the gist: 
              at each table's head that growing pile of shards
is not waste but homage to the potter.
              The world's a dish to relish, to finish:

this conch afloat in broth
              a frilly and vertical eye  
though portent & probably tainted, is solace
              like these towers of loquats & glittering scales
or our bright pans' brash mortal clanging.

              Blink back the sun and look inside.
Our tiny lights don't at all resemble stars.  
              Come in, come sup. You'll never feel full.






It Isnt Me
 

It isn't me, he'd say, 
stepping out of a landscape
that offered, he'd thought, the backdrop
to a plausible existence
until he entered it; it's just not me,
he'd murmur, walking away.

It's not quite me, he'd explain,
apologetic but firm,
leaving some job they'd found him.
They found him others: he'd go,
smiling his smile, putting
his best foot forward, till again

he'd find himself reluctantly concluding
that this, too, wasn't him.
He wanted to get married, make a home,
unfold a life among his neighbors' lives,
branching and blossoming like a tree,
but when it came to it, it isn't me

was all he seemed to learn
from all his diligent forays outward.
And why it should be so hard
for someone not so different from themselves,
to find what they'd found, barely even seeking;
what gift he'd not been given, what forlorn

charm of his they'd had the luck to lack,
puzzled them--though not unduly:
they lived inside their lives so fully
they couldn't, in the end, believe in him,
except as some half-legendary figure
destined, or doomed, to carry on his back

the weight of their own all-but-weightless, stray
doubts and discomforts. Only sometimes,
alone in offices or living rooms,
they'd hear that phrase again: it isn't me, 
and wonder, briefly, what they were, and where,
and feel the strangeness of being there.





Dear Suburb
 

I'm not interested in sadness,
just a yard as elder earth,
a library of sunflowers
battered by the night's rain.
When sliced wide, halved at dawn,
I can see how you exist, 
O satellite town, your bright possibility 
born again in drywall 
and the diary with the trick lock.
Hardly held, for years I slept
with my window wide open,
wanting screen-cut threads of rain.
Blind suburb, dear untruth,
you who already know what I mean
when I praise every spared copse,
you were my battery, my sad clue,
but after I mowed the lawn
and watched robins chesting
for seeds I couldn't resist
what hung in the toolshed, 
where, with a pair of garden shears
I cut all the hair from my arms. That need,
that scared need to whiten
or clean a surface: plywood or lawn,
and the spywall behind which I stood,
stock-still, and sinned against
the fly's flyness. Though you live
inside me, though you laid eggs
in the moisture at the corners
of my eyes, I still dream about
your sinking empire twenty feet above
sea level, and the many things
you never see: beautiful bleached
gas can, tomato posts bent into art,
how half of a butterfly, cut crosswise,
still looks like a butterfly, etc.





Location, Location
 

So when you go wherever it is you will go
take the moon with you 

and make it wear that democratic white shroud,
pocketless, since rich and poor, 

we take nothing with us, save a small stick or dowel
in the casket, so we can all

burrow through the earth to the Holy Land
when the time is right.

Please forgive that I confessed your amusement 
at Shakespeare's "mewling and puking

in my eulogy. (No one laughed--my delivery was off--
but Otto the Undertaker smiled.) 

He told me that when I shovel some dirt onto 
your soft wood box,

suggestive of the trees where Eve and Adam hid
from the Lord who called--

what were they thinking?--I should press the shovel 
back into the pile 

before the next mourner--my husband, not a Jew 
but a fine man, you said 

once if a hundred times--picks it up because to bury 
the dead is a mitzvah 

that should not be diluted, each person who performs 
the act should get the credit, 

which we will need when that Miscreant Angel
comes to collect his chit. 

Otto dates my step-second cousin twice-removed 
and let me say: I hope 

they marry. Someone who guides the bereaved through 
such a smorgasboard of ritual 

with Virgilian ease deserves as much happiness 
as can be gainsaid 

in the Detroit metropolitan area, legally. By the way, 
ma, we never recovered 

your wedding ring and pearls after some gonif 
pilfered and pawned them 

but trust me, when I find him, I'll shake him 
til the rich give anonymous charity 

or I'll walk away from trouble the way you taught me to--
otherwise, it follows you 

home and perches near the deli tray without bringing 
even a cup and saucer.

Were you ready, ma, when your soul and body 
signed their final confession, 

the angels acting as scribes? No shomer in Rochester Hills 
to stave off ill-tempered

ghosts, ungrateful relatives, rodents, to watch you
until you could don 

your guf hadak, the celestial garment being fashioned 
while your soul went 

back and forth between homes. I must steel myself
like the egg that hardens 

when cooked, the egg I salt and bite into, half-
listening to the rabbi's 

easeful voice: together we recite, offering God
consolation for His loss, 

though I tell my children that you are with God,
and they repeat it so blithely 

and I am so busy with mourner's occupations--
the burying, the tearing,

the endless repetitions, double-taking every mirror 
I pass that offers no vision--

I start to believe what I want to believe: your absence 
here is your presence there,

wherever there is, every piece of land a personal
Elysian field, the best room

at the Fontainbleau, pied  terre with an obstructed view
of oblivion, a corner booth

at the Rascal House and the miniature danish taste
like manna, as they always did.






Delirium
 

Such green, such green,
this apple-, pea- and celadon,

this emerald and pine and lime
unsheathed to make

a miser weep, to make his puny
bunions shrink; these seas

and seas of peony, these showy
tons of rose

to urge a musted monk disrobe,
an eremitic nun unfold;

such breathy, breathy moth
and wasp, such gleeful,

greedy bee to bid
the bully hearts of cops

and bosses sob,
to tell a stubby root unstub, a rusted

hinge unrust, the slug unsalt;
to stir the fusted

lungs to brim, the skin to sting,
the dormant,

tinning tongue to singe and hymn.






Fever
 

The heat so peaked tonight
the moon can't cool

a scum-mucked swimming
pool, or breeze

emerge to lift the frowsy
ruff of owls too hot

to hoot, (the mouse and brown
barn rat astute

enough to know to drop
and dash) while

on the bunched up,
corkscrewed sheets of cots

and slumped brass beds,
the fitful twist

and kink and plead to dream
a dream of air

as bitter cruel as winter
gale that scrapes and blows

and gusts the grate
to luff

the whitened ashes from the coal.






Frostbite
 

Less a nip than gnaw,
the way a goat,

tethered, will ruminate
a rope; the way

each in extremis tip
of ear and nose

unbuds, or snail-
like toe, curled

dreamily, lets
go too fat a foot,

cinching filament
and tendril, pinch

by stony pinch
until the pulse exhausts

and flickers down
to drowse and numb,

the sleep so close,
so old, so mild

inside the placid
scald

and hissing of the snow.






Mixed Media
 

The stars grow lemon
in the field, spread
like tea leaves in
a cup; red-wing
blackbirds fold themselves
into the fence,
corn dreamers.

The sky undulating
with clouds returns
gold-throated arpeggios
to the one walking
at sunrise, sunfall.

Light as the air
I sit on my 
cottage steps;
a tom cat come
home to die for
the day.





A Tribute to Chief Joseph (1840?-1904)
 

Never reaching the promised land in Canada,
HIN-MAH-TOO-YAH-LAT-KET:
"Thunder-rolling-in-the-mountins,
the fugitive chief sits in a corner
of the prison car headed for Oklahoma,
chained to his warriors,
a featherless hawk in exile.

He sees out the window
geese rise from the storm's center
and knows more men died
by snow blizzard
than by cavalry shot.

Still his father's shield
of Wallowa Valley deer and elk
flashes in his eyes
and coyote runs the circles
and a cricket swallows the dark.

How many songs this elder
sang to break the cycle
of cold weather and disease
his people coughed and breathed
in this land of drifting ice.

Now sleepless as the door-guard,
the train rattles like dirt in his teeth,
straw in his eyes.

Holding rage in the palm of his fist,
his people's future spirals to red-forest dust,
leaves his bones on the track,
his soul in the whistle.





Consulting an Elder Poet on an Anti-War Poem
 

for Elizabeth Bishop
You said to me that day,
"There's nothing you can do,
and spoke of Auden's line:
"Poetry makes nothing happen.
And though I honor you,
especially your poems,
the objects you dipped in light,
then, left in the rainbow,
let slip from our sight,
I admitted, diving out of self,
a sweet woman's white caress,
the hundreds of lives and places
in books, failed to counter confusion.

You did agree that it
was Socrates who said
to his Athenian friends
that governments are only
governments with many heads
and cannot think as one.
That history continues to show
how they swing from war
to peace and back again,
in one wide gallow-sweep
just as the pendulum
of the world's clocks
returned its towns to craters.

Now I must ask myself,
fifteen cobalt-blue years later,
if the dust of each new war
that settles in our bones,
and deadens a generation,
is no more than negatives
of the Kennedys, King, and Lennon,
has less weight than what 
we felt the day the Apollo
spaceship landed on the moon,
and Auden's line is true,
then why did you to the end,
live in the dark,
sing into your ruin?





Love Poem
 

The twilight of your face,
the unknown bird in your voice,
draws me again to your eyes' green vision,

your song about that longest
moment, a moon vulnerability,
a Natalie I saw alone,

at Carolyn's party years ago,
where you called me to your side,
and I held my heart, cupped in shadow,

as an offering to your smile,
our soft-spoken isolation.





The Dice Changer
 

Raven steals your name for an autumn joke:
buries you along with it under
the thickest hemlock known to chipmunks.
Too bad you were awake for the event.
He accuses you of asking all
the wrong questions over and over.
You attempt revolt to prove his medicine
wheel is cracked and filling up its own pit.

He hollers your face is unmasked and madness
has found a home. All stink and rotten fur,
he says to you, claims you had a choice
and forgot what it was. Now he says
your pain must run for the river,
the river for the wind.
He chuckles and the dark chatters, turning
you around until your shadow is the earth's.





[What land have you cast from the blotted-out region of your face?]
 

What land have you cast from the blotted-out region of your face?What nation stung by watermarks was filmed out of extinction and brought forth resembling frost?What offspring must jump through the eye of birth to be winked at when covered with brick sweat?What ache piled its planks on the corner pier, now crumbles onto motionless water, sniffed at by forest smoke?What makes this song a string of beads seized by cement cracks when the camera climbs through the basement window--winter clouds coiling through its speckled lens?What season cannot locate an eye in the dark of the sound of the sun gyrating into red ocher after I thought you noticed my language was half wren, half pigeon and, together, we spoke a wing pattern on the wall that was raised to keep "us out, there where "calling became "culling, "distance distanced, in a mere scrape of enamel on yellow teeth?What father woke, turned over his wife, she didn't want to, but he pushed until the baby leapt through, now, now, now, strummed into a chorus of burn marks on ceilings where police sirens fruit magpie skulls on trees of monsoon lightning?What, what, what--is how that song chimed in wilderness.





[They inherit a packet of earth]
 

They inherit a packet of earth
hear its coins clank in a tin box

push them aside
reap thick strands of night from thinning black hair.

They climb the staircase clenching branches of pens filled with ducks' blood

and follow the butcher's bed into this room--
          goose feathers thorning out of their eyes.

They promise to never look down again
down is just a speck of globe dust

                                          just coins clanking in the tin box.





To Frighten a Storm
 

O now you come in rut,
in rank and black desire,
to beat the brush, to lash
the wind with your long hair.
Ha! I am afraid,
exceedingly afraid.
But see? her path goes there,
along the swaying tops
of trees, up to the hills.
Too long she is alone.
Bypass our fields, and mount
your ravages of fire
and rain on higher trails.
You shall have her lying down
upon the smoking mountains.





Combing
 

Bending, I bow my head
and lay my hands upon
her hair, combing, and think
how women do this for
each other. My daughter's hair
curls against the comb,
wet and fragrant-- orange
parings. Her face, downcast,
is quiet for one so young.

I take her place. Beneath
my mother's hands I feel
the braids drawn up tight
as piano wires and singing,
vinegar-rinsed. Sitting
before the oven I hear
the orange coils tick
the early hour before school.

She combed her grandmother
Mathilda's hair using
a comb made out of bone.
Mathilda rocked her oak wood
chair, her face downcast,
intent on tearing rags 
in strips to braid a cotton
rug from bits of orange
and brown. A simple act
Preparing hair. Something
women do for each other,
plaiting the generations.





Prayer to Fix the Affections
 

O Ancient One,
your web hangs down from the pines.
I am of the Owl clan.
I have been to water,
my dress is of red clay.
He moves at the edge of you,
binds us with your threads.
The center of his soul shall be my soul's center.
Our paths shall be white forever.
Where we move the paths from every direction
shall recognize each other.
We are one never to be parted.





The Visitor
 

In Spanish he whispers there is no time left.
It is the sound of scythes arcing in wheat,
the ache of some field song in Salvador.
The wind along the prison, cautious
as Francisco's hands on the inside, touching
the walls as he walks, it is his wife's breath
slipping into his cell each night while he
imagines his hand to be hers. It is a small country.

There is nothing one man will not do to another.
                                                              1979





An Identity Crisis
 

I certainly know who I am . . .

I can get away with being politically incorrect. 
I am the ambassador to First Nations' poetic expressions
& as Kinsella pompously put it straight
"I have the license to do so.

what a magical way to escape tyranny!
just like Trudeau & Chrtien hiding beneath cowboy hats

nevertheless & back to the point,

call me cowboy
call me First Nations
call me aboriginal
call me native
call me chug
call me skin

if you must,
but never call me Indian.
I call myself that!

& if you feel guilty when I say so,
this is not about postcolonial rhetoric
it is about an identity crisis






Guitar Player
 

Where do you want my heart now?

Placed next to yours
on your pale skin
so that I will fall
in love with your sweaty pain

I have heard
your bones crack the dry cement
that leafed the frenzied spirit within

I witnessed its wildness escape into your body
screaming kissy words
while your fingers plucked at my guitar

your eyes were Koyoti's & Ska-la-la's
trying to rip a path to my soul

& I froze there in my manly state
knowing there's nothing that I can do





Maximus to Gloucester, Letter 27 [withheld]
 

I come back to the geography of it,
the land falling off to the left
where my father shot his scabby golf
and the rest of us played baseball
into the summer darkness until no flies
could be seen and we came home
to our various piazzas where the women
buzzed

To the left the land fell to the city,
to the right, it fell to the sea

I was so young my first memory
is of a tent spread to feed lobsters
to Rexall conventioneers, and my father,
a man for kicks, came out of the tent roaring
with a bread-knife in his teeth to take care of
the druggist they'd told him had made a pass at 
my mother, she laughing, so sure, as round
as her face, Hines pink and apple,
under one of those frame hats women then


This, is no bare incoming
of novel abstract form, this

is no welter or the forms
of those events, this,

Greeks, is the stopping
of the battle

               It is the imposing
of all those antecedent predecessions, the precessions

of me, the generation of those facts
which are my words, it is coming

from all that I no longer am, yet am,
the slow westward motion of

more than I am


There is no strict personal order

for my inheritance.


                     No Greek will be able

to discriminate my body.

                        An American

is a complex of occasions,

themselves a geometry

of spatial nature.


           I have this sense,

that I am one

with my skin

             Plus this--plus this:

that forever the geography

which leans in

on me I compell

backwards I compell Gloucester

to yield, to

change

          Polis

is this





Madischie Mafia
 

Velroy de-jays the sance-turntables,
spinning black water,
scratching out full moons 
with red and blue curves of hip hop.
In the dance club, bodies are a collection
of sunrise songs in reverse.

Corey wears her cat-eye contacts
and no panties.
There's the bathroom-stall
eagle medicine with Ecstasy placed on the tongue.
She handles the lace like a Kiowa church hymn.

Dee is Cheyenne, Arapaho, Comanche,
Kiowa, and Fort Sill Apache.
He couldn't enroll into any tribe
but he can grass dance, bump and grind,
and do the Jerry Lewis. 
Black girls love him.

Stoney has four wives, Indian way.
He has ghost medicine
and carries a small white ball of clay.
He sells peyote and coke to the white boys.

I have a southern accent.
I killed a Lakota man,
he was a Rollin '20.
It was with a shotgun.
It was powwow season,
I fancy danced.






Colors of the Comanche Nation Flag
 

                              Red

Mupits' breath, in moonlight, outside a child's bedroom window

Hunter's bones scattered on the prairie

Fragrance of Comanche gangstas who entered The Zoo Club
and assassinated the bosses of Underworld Seven,
a Navajo crime syndicate

Little Stoney Burgess's footprints after catching ghost sickness
by running through Post Oak Cemetery chased
by snot-nosed bully, Blender Plenty Bear


                              Blue

Lips of the poisoned tribal chairman collapsed on the buffet table
at the 1974 Comanche Nation Inaugural Dinner

Silk handkerchief drawn over the stuffed owl used to converse 
with the dead

In the woods, it's the laughter of Deer Woman as she stomps
her male victim to death

Electric guitar distortion of the Messiah playing Jimi Hendrix's
Machine Gun as she strolls into the Indian bar


                               Yellow

Coyote's eyes in the darkness of the backseat at midnight 
as you speed down Mt. Scott, on a dare, with the headlights off

Crushed buffalo kidney stones used in graffiti to magically
imprison the river-witch underneath the I-44 bridge

Intricate beadwork on Lucifer's cane
left at the funnel cake stand at Comanche Fair

Flashing ignition light to the engines of the great abyss






Family Tree or Comanches and Cars Dont Mix
 

Spanish captive, Hoahwah, married twin sisters.
The one wife called Double
turned into a snake
after eating a nest of glossy eggs.
Snake Woman still lives on Mt. Scott,
sleeps facing west.
The sun a white skull itself 
bathes her on the cedar breaks.
In rectangular dreams
she calls the young men grandson.

The other sister Tsi-yee, named after a war deed
(her father charged a cavalry office
knocked him off his horse then lanced him to the prairie)
bore three children: Tabe titah, Namnetse, and Sam Hoahwah.

Lena, Sam Hoahwah's favorite daughter
ran off with an Arapaho from Canton.
Sam sent his men after her
on horseback, their ranch-hand-shadows
overcast the Cheyenne and Arapaho Rez.
Lena said: I ain't comin back.
She bled to death on a mattress after a miscarriage.

Mother couldn't remember Lena
just the car ride to Post Oak Cemetery
and watching wind in the pinwheels.
Mother died the same age, fish-tailing
into Comanche history
in a Chevy Z-28 without car insurance. 

Great grandfather Sam Hoahwah
first Indian in southwest Oklahoma to own a car
got run over with his own Model-T.
His Mexican cowboy-chauffeur 
forgot to take it out of gear
when Sam crank-started the car.

Not far from his own car, Uncle Fredrick
was found dead in the weeds of Cache Road,
keys missing.
He sang gospels in Comanche, 
and backup on Robby Robertson's
Contact from the Underworld of RedBoy.
(Uncle liked Levon Helm better.)

Frederick Jr. caught ghost sickness
bicycling across Post Oak Cemetery at night.
He looked past his shoulder
it twisted his face.
The moon mocks him now.

After the incident, his girlfriend fell
in love with his cousin Rusty
nicknamed Rabbit
who loves fried baloney
and calls it Indian Steak.

Rabbit's younger brother
paints abstract horse murals
in empty swimming pools,

and images of a 20 foot long red talking snake
who calls him grandson in his dreams.






Red River
 

. . . makes a noisy entry into Texas
like tumbling file cabinets.

Four mountains
Four creeks
Four forts
Four suns
Four seasons
Four nations--Comanche, Kiowa, Cheyenne, Arapaho

          *

At Yellow House Canyon
the river turns tight.
Talons skim the water,
waves confirm dawn.

With white sheets tied around their waists
Tonkawa scouts cannibalistically count out
a bag of children's hands.

Seated in a silver Concho saddle,
Death's dirty sergeant lights up
his ceremonial breathing leaf.

          *

Where Cache Creek empties into the Red River
is a nerve center of war.
There Velroy fought the gruesome brotherhood:
Blue Corpse, Smallpox, and the Creeper, cruel 300 lb nymphs.
They tried to strip his body of Carbon-14 atoms.

Velroy, knowledgeable in the Flying Crane Technique
of Kung-Fu,
drop-kicked Blue Corpse in the windpipe
simultaneously breaking his neck
in three places. 

He tricked The Creeper with his own taboo.
By passing wolf's milk and tequila
through a hole in an oak tree,
it made The Creeper vomit up his own stomach.
Velroy quickly buried it,
turning him into a tree.

Smallpox challenged Velroy
to a dance-off.
It took place on top of the creek.
While Smallpox was doing a head spin,
Velroy pulled the cardboard out from under him.
Smallpox dropped into the water and drowned. 

          *

Snake Woman sits in the deep,
a cinema of silver scales.
Her hair moves like meadow grass in flood water.

          *

Members of the Black Knife Society
crossed the south fork of the river
on horseback in a V-formation.
They possess gear
simultaneously musical and military:
a stretched skin to serve as
both shield and drum,
and a club, sword, or lance
that is also a drumstick.

          *

At the Red River
Ute chief cuts my guitar strings
Ute women love Punk






Shipwreck in Haven, Part Four
 

I


Fate is cleverer than the king
of Babylon. Shadow of yew
fall through windows onto

the floor of the nave and
touch the pillars with tattered
shade. You claim the dearest wish of your

life is to sink into a soul-freezing
situation of horror.  The music of a crash
caught in the hollow of a wooded hillside.



2


Grave, questioning sweep--chiefly the weird
that arouses our keenest hopes. The garden of
dreams contains a summerhouse, hazy

period of my growth. There are bodies,
not greatly extended, called seas nevertheless,
because of their depth and

violence. I've some little
doubt about this ceremony entirely
embedded in a cup of grassy hills.



3


Pardon me for loitering. I was sleeping
soundly when I was roused by the loud
clang of what turned out to be

a large brass candlestick, flung
against the banister. Unprotected,
destitute of the means of self-defense, you

hug to yourself the consciousness of
vanished beauty. The sea is un-
certain, on the main and also along the coast.



4


Strange rooms. Through these experimental
years, who can describe beauty
in the dead of night? Complain of

frivolity or of portraits exactly
like ghosts. The waters of the great
surrounding sea will completely

evaporate when the sun opens the fifth
of its seven eyes. Oh yes, I take
pleasure in backgrounds, bringing them forward.



5


These are only a few of many
legendary details, called from the distant
future where each thing has its

end, including sea, sun, the eyes.
You live in another season--even now I
feel acrobatic instincts. Large strange

rooms. A silver cup from his household
plate, a sky of the same
gray tones, a great wilderness of books.



6


When the sea subsides into utter
calm, changing clouds caught in its
clarity, then fishermen say the sea

is thinking about itself. A dark back
room, looking down upon a narrow
courtyard--waking out of some

dreams of specters, bellowing the most
frightful shrieks, forgetting only
at the sound of somebody's voice.



7


You light me to bed with your light, and
never a night but I am
prey to ghostly visions--a tenderness

no usual in my family. The lion
pauses a certain space of time, amid
a sea of divers thoughts, choppy half

desires, memoranda of search
and hunger, very peculiar
ideas of the world.

An Apparatus
 

From where I sit, I can see other
things: a silver porcupine, pins
standing upright. It is a vanished tale of a
vanished forest at the shore of a vanished ocean.

I call the dead as often as I can. In the
vaults, among mummies--this is pure
memorial. I am the girl in whose
eyes the name is written.

I feel as if veiled, as if soon I
shall get to know something. These are people
with encephalitis who cannot go
forward, but can go backward, and can dance.

In this rough draft of my memoirs, my brother
comes toward me--frightened, skeletal--longing
for marvels. I cannot describe it better than by
comparing it to other figures, intoxication.

Mere reflexes, as for instance breathing, can become
conscious. One of two rivals has his
ornamental tail bit off. In dying sounds, barely
reaching our ears, a melody continues.

No end to it--an infinite progression. All this
love of a bygone age. Watch the track
of a concentrated sunbeam through our lake ice:
part of the beam is stopped, part goes through.

Now the upper surface buckles, phantasmagoria of
unchained passion--under which the land
quakes, the ocean swells, and a myriad-years-
old forest snaps and cracks.

Surpassing all forms of experience, the wide, deep,
freshwater lake--on which the city
is built--rises before us. Here a modern idea
interposes, a new body made from the elements.

Then everything is forgotten. Sometimes thoughts
are cut off and sometimes they are the
blade which cuts. At the present gravel pit, electric
lights in the evening cast their magic blue sheen.

There's the sun, a crack above those
hills, breaking the day. If the door open, who
comes in? If it close, what will interrupt
my train?

The staircase effect supplies strong evidence
for a subjective map. Downhill, the sun
trickles, unperturbed. Here trots a mammoth with
red wool, through the black yew forest.

The tendency of elements to linger on: You say
I dream of what I want, but what I
want now is to dream. The cold rind
broken, the same wind blows.

Through a lens of ice, the dark
heat of the sun burns wood, fires gunpowder, melts
lead. Perhaps a cloud of musk rises, such as
issues from a crocodile in passion.

Unless light falls properly upon these
flowers, you cannot see them. All associations at
this level rain down from above. We
talk of word-pictures.

We observe vertigo. We reach the cleft
by a steep gully or couloir--very dangerous, the
path from the heights, the glory of
the prospect, the insight gained.

What I mean is a disturbance in
all the senses at once. You will not find
the flower confused. Facing a certain
wind, there is always danger.






"Majesty
 

Among other economies, I'm of two
minds, one possessed, the other
a deep peace. Violent trembling
seizes me, launched in the interval.

Enemy of children, of quaint little
things, of jokes and pictures. Enemy
of comic papers and caricatures, of
water-drinking. Too short for tragedy.

Rarely has a large or distant expedition
ever succeeded in its object, as may be
seen in the failure of foreign missions, of
human development, the immediate phenomena.

Sympathy for the victors, who gallantly
perish. Collateral catastrophes, as if they
had a will. The more distinctive visual images
sail too long, relinquish, burst.

The "inner voice is playing a game. Eagerness
and obstinacy. A mysterious invisible
placed in the mouth. We know too well how
terrible it is to contend against personality.

The whole idyll vanishes. Southward along
a coastline, down among cities. Across the
gulf to the promontory. Probably
astonished. Not without mistrust.

You are now my prisoner. Physically I am
myself. Cultivated living, good manners, rich
food and drink, order and elegance in
my house. Erect military bearing.





Soft Hail
 

Afterward, to tell how it was possible to
identify absolute space, a matter of great
difficulty, keeping in mind always
that not all old music is beautiful and
therefore it's necessary to choose. Ice
loading and unloading as the ice caps
wax and wither. Brutal and uncouth from the beginning
even unto time, space, place, motion.

How are we to obtain true motion? I
predict a fiasco--and a fiasco
with catcalls. Wind circulation in the
case of plants, predators in the case
of animals, affecting their distribution on
the ancient land masses. And
who will conduct the chorus and
orchestra? Many things exist at once.

Predilection and preference. Begin
with the storm. A very agile, beautiful
voice. With tremendous temperament. The earth's
magnetic field weakening. Even the princess
is drawn into the violence of the action,
extremes of joy, mad ravings, almost
requiring the conventions of opera. Thus,
thus; we parted, thus to meet again.

Thus in a ship, under sail, since the sun
itself is moving, supposing Infinite
Space to be (as it were) Sensorium
of the Omnipresent. Reduced to a
few feet of ground, we begin with great
delight to plant a garden. The Czar is in
that garden. Quiet eruptions, safe enough to attract
tourists. We suppose other bodies annihilated.

Upon any conditions supposed, taught to describe
accurately, I detest everything that smells
of theory. If we look at similar
coral reefs, the past location of the same
precise environment can be traced. But 
there the comparison breaks. And from these
relative motions will arise the relative
motion of a body on the earth.





The Unreliable Narrator
 

A great crime: she has
plunged a dagger into the heart
of her mother.

Strange.

The strangest thing: a mocking little pride with
a sinister click as of a fitting together of bad
pieces.

Beyond knowing. The mesmerist's only
child. A certain indication of anemia, too much
candy, and her charming eyes.

A privilege to be near her. My
inspiriation. I risk an approach, what I call "the light of
day. Movements, with perfect indifference, turn
place and shrink. One
might have seen less: the glimmer of
nothing. I caught no full-blown
flower of theory. And yet such visions pale in
flight.

Gorgeous, the domestic manufacture
of sausages.

Swallow and "so calligraphic a bird.

Somebody in Dickens. Attaching
diminutive eggs.

A glamour of memory.

Assurance of intimacy on the
summer air.

Nothing to explain. We
needed breathing time. Enough to
laugh. Odd what a difference. Only to
whistle to her. Delighted to come.

I know. Prepared to reply and turning a think skein of
sewing silk sus-
pended in
entanglement. Shown "the faintest far-off
chords, I ask myself.

Our doom complete.

The difference, so simple: she had
folded up her manner. Great advantages now, my
dear, if he will show you. Dis-
appointment and its train might enter.

The wedding day, the fever season. But
they're dying. Kindred circle of the 
tipsy, come to call. Lurid memory
remained with me, was indeed our sense of
"dissipation. (Horses. A high aesthetic revel.) Rome
made him invest unconscionable sums in postage. He
received answers in a delicate hand or tried to think.

Sublime snythesis. A bridge
over--liable to rear up. You just had to
wait for it, curiosity worked up with
a hard-boiled egg and a doughnut.

(Very ugly, but
I LIKE UGLY. Just the
sort of ugliness to
be like looking.)

Happy, he entered the streetcar's
nocturnal "exercise, the platform it evidently
was to be. Bad lecture-blood her enthusiasm. Catchpenny
monsters. The ideal day with that sense of resorting.

In imagination, we mean to do well. No faith in girlhood, her antediluvian
theories not much better. Well, she should get
rid of him. The logical hero.






Blood Memory
 

Hunched in the bath, four ibuprofen gulped
         too late to dull the muscle cramping
                  to sate a god who thirsts
         monthly for his slake of iron,
I am just a body bleeding in bad light.

But after an hour, as the wrenching wanes, 
I run more water in, remembering
         when I was a girl my mother knew
                           one cure for this pain 
                           and, while I cried, 
         carried me mugs of tea and whiskey
                  clouded with sugar cubes.

In a palm of pinkish water, I scoop up 
         a burl of my flesh, almond-sized.
                  The tissues settle, livid
red to nearly black as I tilt my hand
                  against the light to see it
glistening like a ruby cabochon, 
                  appealing as it appalls, 
            recalling one future, years ago,
            that would have borne itself on my blood 
                           had I allowed.  
                  The question swims into view:
would I harbor another life now?

Last spring, I sat above the harbor in Naples 
                  with three friends whose children, 
         after a week's vacation, were all 
safely back at school. Palpable, 
                           the holiday mood 
         a morning freed from offspring brought!
(I'd felt a guilty pleasure I'd go home 
         not to cook someone's lunch, 
                           but to read.) 
Still, it wasn't long before our talk's 
         compass needle trembled north 
                  toward the motherland: 
soccer games in the Flegrean fields,
                           ancient sun 
            reborn and swaddled putto-pink 
            in mist above the fumaroles; 
                           rococo 
                  messes of gelato; 
first words, whose honeyed gravity 
                           weighed on me 
                           like a toddler's head 
         snugged below my chin in sleep.

                  Then, Serena described 
         troubles at her daughter's school.
Their new principal refused to pay 
         the local gang's protection money.
                           And so, the teachers 
         arrived at work one day to find
         the hutches where the children kept
rabbits and a little clutch of chicks 
                           overturned. 
                  From the playground swings 
                  the throat-cut animals hung.  
         Next time we come for you 
someone had written across the door in blood.
                  Now the parents wanted 
                  the principal to pay:
            that was how these things were done.  
                           Screw her ideals, 
                           Serena heard.
That bitch is going to get our children killed.
         A blade bossed with oyster floats, 
the harbor glinted below Serena's voice.  
         Into that water, Apicius wrote, 
                  the Romans tossed slaves 
         to glut the eels they'd later eat 
with tits and vulvae, succulently cooked, 
                  of sows who'd aborted their litters. 

                           And from that water, 
                  fishermen pulled a girl
                           who'd been under 
                           at least a week.
         She may have been the missing one 
         the papers were reporting on  
                           whose photo showed her 
         lippy, grinning, seventeen.
                           A week in that wake.
She was scoured of identity. 

                  Water's thick in Naples 
                           as martyr's blood 
         rusting in ampoules in the cathedral,
where it liquefies on schedule 
                           --and it does; 
                  I've seen the miracle-- 
                           to show the city's 
            still protected by the saint.   

         I can't remember, six months later, 
         loggy in my cooling bath,
if some net had hauled these images 
         writhing up at me that morning
                           as we sat together 
                           near the harbor,
         or if they'd tangled in my thoughts 
that same evening after Serena's dinner  
                  honoring Women's Day.  
                           Across Europe, 
lapels flickered yellow wicks of mimosa, 
                           marking the feast.  
                           And in Naples, 
                  flowers fumed for women 
burned on the flank of Mt. Vesuvius 
                  where they'd been sewing 
         sweatshop zippers on fake designer bags.

         But as it did with everything, 
the city managed to transubstantiate 
         horror into carnival. 
                  With Theresa and Ellie 
         I'd walked home late along the harbor. 
Fireworks seethed above the bobbing masts. 
         Mirroring those harrier stars 
         the water seemed to flame, while 
                           drowned in lights 
         the Lungomare phosphoresced.
                  Scooters rippled through 
                           the reefs of cars, 
         barely slowing for schools of boys 
                            and women in flocks, 
                  stiletto-heeled, who stalked 
         screeching over the cobblestones.
                        From an alley's mouth 
                        a gobbet of men disgorged.  
One, drunker than the others, loomed
         over and bent his face to mine.
                  Where are your babies? he hissed,
                  spit pricking my skin.
                           Get home to your babies.  
         Not just drunk but whetted, his glare 
         stropped beyond seeing and testing its edge. 
                           You're over-the-hill 
                  for trolling--is that what he meant?
         Or was he putting all women away, 
                           including the vampire-
                           lipsticked teens? 
Whatever he meant, he meant to make us bleed.  

         I wince, drain chill water out, 
                  drizzle in a little 
                           more of the hot, 
         and wonder at this habit 
of holding others' words as worry stones 
         to fidget absentmindedly 
                           when thought goes slack.   
         Agates of fury, quartzes of scorn.
                  Cold in my ear's palm, 
the hematite heaviness of a final no.

         And I still turn over my mother's words, 
                                    costly pearls,
                  handed me years ago
in a college project on oral history.  
         She took my assignment seriously, 
         agreeing to an interview 
                  as if it would allow 
                  her, too, to wash 
through the wrack of half-forgotten truths.  
         Painstakingly on tape 
                  she recorded her life, 
         lapped by sluices and hesitations.  
Her years in the Women's Army Corps,
         screening films on safety and hygiene 
                  to bored enlisted men. 
                           Her depression.
Decades as a secretary. Marriage.  

         Until, near side B's close, there gathered 
                  a final, muscled wave: 
         how, when she was well past forty, 
                           her bleeding stopped.  
         At first, she thought it was her age. 
                  Then--slowly, sickly--
                           she understood. 
                           She'd tried to find 
         a doctor who would help her, but 
                           (her voice cresting, breaking) 
five months along, it was too late, 
         even if she'd had the money.  
The tape's hiss like receding surf.   

                  So here I am, at daybreak, 
                  adjusting the taps with my toes. 

         I think we are shelled animals, 
hauled at by tides, sleeking invasive grit 
                  with our nacre. I think of her 
hiding in the tub for half an hour 
                  to read; think how pleased 
         I was, finding her, to pull her 
                           back to me. 

Little plumes of my flesh rock in the swells, 
                  but my body is bland now, 
                           yielding as kelp, 
            and with my toes I pull the plug.   

Drained, I need a couple hours of sleep, 
         then I'll start the day again. 
                  And maybe, if I'm sleeping late, 
                           the dream will come, 
                  one that intrigues me almost 
         more than it disturbs, in which 
                           I'm falling, bound, 
into a bay of blood-threshed water. 
                  Fear ties me; brine
            bites my lungs and I can't breathe.
            Then, with a clarity I mistake 
                           for waking, I wake 
below trees, at a table laid
                  variously with meats--
                  meats I realize, 
from a shudder in the grove's air, 
                                    are human. 
         It should be awful; it is awful.
                           But with a calm 
         familiar only here, a calm 
I've never known in any other place, 
         I find myself longing to taste 
                           the dish's savor, 
braised and stuffed, as Apicius writes, 
                           with larks' tongues.
 





Am I lovely? Of course!
 


Am I lovely? Of course!
Breathlessly I taste
the subtle compliment 
of a handmade caress.
Chop me into tiny bits,
caress and tame my soul, 
that godly swallow
you love to no end.





Those who are asleep in the earth
 

Those who are asleep in the earth
have an avian sense of the way.
Gone, they sleep with shoes on,
ready to rise and go
to the pink, dispensable, 
barefooted insomniacs
who had laced up for them  
the last pair of shoes.





To converse with the greats
 

To converse with the greats
by trying their blindfolds on;
to correspond with books
by rewriting them;
to edit holy edicts,
and at the midnight hour
to talk with the clock by tapping a wall
in the solitary confinement of the universe.





I am in love, hence free to live
 

I am in love, hence free to live
by heart, to ad lib as I caress.
A soul is light when full,
heavy when vacuous.
My soul is light. She is not afraid
to dance the agony alone,
for I was born wearing your shirt,
will come from the dead with that shirt on.





Multiplying in a column M by F
 

Multiplying in a column M by F 
do we get one or two as a result?
May the body stay glued to the soul,
may the soul fear the body.
Do I ask too much? I only wish  
the crucible of tenderness would melt
memories, and I would sleep, my cheek
pressed against your back, as on a motorbike . . .






When the very last grief
 

When the very last grief
deadens all our pain,
I will follow you there
on the very next train,
not because I lack strength 
to ponder the end result,
but maybe you forgot to bring
pills, a necktie, razor blades . . . 





He marked the page with a match
 

He marked the page with a match
and fell asleep in mid-kiss,
while I, a queen bee
in a disturbed hive, stay up and buzz:
half a kingdom for a honey drop,
half a lifetime for a tender word!
His face, half turned.
Half past midnight. Half past one.





Only she who has breast-fed
 

Only she who has breast-fed
knows how beautiful the ear is.
Only they who have been breast-fed
know the beauty of the clavicle.
Only to humans the Creator 
has given the earlobe.
The humans, through clavicles 
slightly resembling birds, 
entwined in caresses fly
to the place at night where, 
rocking the cradle of cradles, 
the babe is wailing, 
where on a pillow of air 
the stars nestle like toys.
And some of them speak.






To Whom it May Concern
 

For Harry Cobb
Soon I'll move to Norway.
If that's a bitter pill,

well, swill, swallow. I'm going,
and I won't wallow, not in Norway,

where they're so beyond
slave labor, with laws that say

a clerk must work within five
meters of a window through

which she can see a tree
and by that tree be seen.

My mind's made up. 
I will be Norwegian with Norwegian

trees. I'll be seer and be seen.
It's a scenic scene, it's 

how it goes, I'm going.
Tell the top brass, if

they ask, I don't give
a damn about their asses.

But I will miss the beeches and the ashes.
It's not their fault I'm leaving.

They're only trees, and 
leaving, I'm Norwegian.






Butter
 

I've never seen the land
of milk and honey, but at 

the Iowa State Fair I glimpsed
a cow fashioned of butter.

It lived behind a window 
in an icy room, beneath klieg lights.

I filed past as one files
past a casket at a wake.

It was that sad: a butter cow
without a butter calf. Nearby I spied

a butter motorcycle, motorcycle-
sized, a mechanical afterthought

I thought the cow might have liked to ride.
You don't drive a motorcycle; you ride it.

But not if you're a butter cow, not
if you're a butter cow who's seen, if

not the land of milk and honey, the land
of milk, and dwelled within it.

It had a short life span, the butter cow.
Before it died, I looked

deep into its butter eyes. It saw
my butter soul. I could

have wept, or spread myself, 
for nobody, across dry toast.






Convergences
 

At sixteen he dismisses his mother with contempt. 
She hears with dread the repulsive wave's approach
and her fifty-year-old body smothers under water.

An old man loses half his weight, as if by stealth,
but finds in his shed his great-grandfather's knobbly cane, 
and hobbles toward youth beside the pond's swart water.

She listens to the dun-colored whippoorwill's
three-beat before dawn, and again when dusk
enters the cornfield parched and wanting water.

He imagines but cannot bring himself to believe
that the dead woman enters his house disguised 
or that the young rabbi made vin rouge from water.

Within the poem he and she--hot, cold, and luke--
converge into flesh of vowels and consonant bones
or into uncanny affection of earth for water.






Advent
 

When I see the cradle rocking 
What is it that I see?
I see a rood on the hilltop
        Of Calvary.

When I hear the cattle lowing 
What is it that they say?
They say that shadows feasted
        At Tenebrae.

When I know that the grave is empty,
Absence eviscerates me,
And I dwell in a cavernous, constant
        Horror vacui. 






Roses
 

. . . mangiavano le rose.
Because I do not know
what a hendecasyllable is
and words is all I have
to transubstantiate and give,
within me I hunger for a tongue
of my own, unpronounceable
flavors worth a thousand madeleines
(Monsieur P.) as hunting-horns spiral
through my belly and I say:
Schmorrn muis kneidl tirschtlan
guglhupf schluzza friggl prennsuppe
hoadana kneidl hoadanO plente
schaitohaufn kiochlan unt niggilan
faignkaffe kropfn unt Tpfnudl
so rich so good and tasty the speck
smoked wurscht and roast chestnuts
never to be tasted again where cement
has ousted the forest and the wood
                               (gas is the flame).
Because I do not know
                 because I do not know how
to plant roses by the spring
now dry, let my tears fill the fountain
where waters no longer flow,
and sing to the poet who broke
the mold (and ate red tulips
when sitting among stiff bores).
                   Because I do not know why
lunatics hunger after roses and still
appetite with petals behind high walls,
and because I do not know
how to chew the sound of the word
                          in a hendecasyllable line
along the way I must plant
a hedge or red roses
                           to taste and see.





Giving Birth
 

Now She knows what it feels like
24 hours of it & all for a mere girl
when She had expected a male heir.
Has seen so far only the hands &
they are beautiful--laughs already
like a bear, wrapped as a Della Robbia
infant in glazed porcelain on the cornice
of the Loggia degli Innocenti.

Nobody thought of the bottle
nor told her to put a drop of honey
on her teat as She saw the nurse do
when It sucked voraciously.
He better come if He wants to and see
what's left of It--will hardly survive
another week--& to find a name for It
is his job. I call It Contrary.

Thus entered the world at loggerheads.






She Stands
 

She stands at the top of the stair
as childless Tom
                         saw her weep.

Fatherless in red Spyders elsewhere
rich daughters whiz through Paris
or cruise the Greek Islands as non-
daddy leaps in grasshopper fashion
on a merry-go-round. Tall and bony
they're properly married, endowed.

Spared such a fate, the richly poor
country girl sometimes resented
her tattered state. Having to seek
treasures in a briar patch, she
found daffodils and violets
in dewy meadows mid-March.

Now late in the years, the wind lays
burnished gold leaves
                                    on her feet.*

Prison Chaplain
 

For Stuart Longtin
Heavy and gray now, dressed in deacon's robes--
I see you in your Speedo at Floyd Lake,
its nylon clinging to those golden globes
you exercised for Moorhead football's sake.

We hiked the Black Trail to Itasca Park,
but now I see a deacon hard at work
explicating the Gospel of St. Mark,
our high school quarterback become a clerk--

in the high sense. A boy with such good looks,
you could have run to Hollywood and whored
but turned to mastery of sacred books
and the manly mimesis of our Lord.

Lifesaver, that was your job at Wilderness,
teaching tenderfoot farm boys how to swim.
Soulsaver, I would call you now and bless
any man who preaches Saint Mark to Tim.

We take our coffee outside for the view,
patrol the walk-about with twelve-foot mesh
where drunks can smoke. What has become of Stu?
The Word. Not on the page but in the flesh.




                                                      Prairie St. John's Hospital






"Mizar and "Alcor in Winter
 

Cirrus dispersed. As a black night grew colder,
clearer, I spied the binary in the handle
of the Big Dipper dangling above my shoulder,
a pinprick twinkling by a blinding candle.

Absent the moon, its boreal corona,
I watched the stars rise east of Ellendale,
Guelph and Ludden, then wheel above Verona
and sleeping friends who farm near Englevale.

A thousand miles of road: I'd shunned the pavement
which bears the burdens I no longer ferry,
the cargo of material enslavement.
Six eagles hunted small game on the prairie.

An Arab prince's fortunes once were measured
by blooded foals, by sons his wives could dandle,
by tributary quatrains to be treasured
and his eyesight: a pinprick by a candle.






Asperges Me
 

Cleanse me of my iniquity
and wash away my sins.
Laugh, Lord, at my obliquity.
In you laughter begins.

Regard this little steeple.
You gave to the High Plains
a flock of sheep, the people
who drink deep when it rains.

I shall number all the stones
Assyria has laid low.
I shall number all my bones
as David did long ago.

Oh, what a troubled route man took,
descending from the trees:
cave paintings and the printed book
made on his bended knees.

Lord, the broken spirit,
the sorrows in my heart
are much, much to inherit
and hard, hard to impart.








A Hymn
 

When I fall into the abyss, I go straight into it, head down and heels up, and I'm even pleased that I'm falling in just such a humiliating position, and for me I find it beautiful. And so in that very shame I suddenly begin a hymn.          --Fyodor Dostoevsky
I traveled to the page where scripture meets fiction.
The paper slept but the night in me woke up.

Black letters were now alive
and collectible in a material crawl.

I could not decipher their intentions anymore.
To what end did their shapes come forth?

To seduce or speak truth?

While birds swept over the water 
like pot-bellied angels 

beautiful bells rang to assist the hoist.

Up they went to slake their thirst, 
drinking from the mist

for the sound of bells seemed to free
as well as hold them.

Then down to scavenge the surf
and eat the innocent.

"I love God and the ferry too, wrote Kerouac.

Only that which exists can be spoken of.


*     *     *


I wonder, will our imagination 
remain a temple burning with candles

against all odds? 
Behind a nipple and a bone?

The simplest of glands laid in a circle 
around skin and liquid

that stirs up imagery
winged and prismed, as if blood

were a wine inducing visions


*     *     *




Some people cry when the characters die. 

Then they kill themselves offstage, away from the pages
that they are turning in the night.

Some people sacrifice themselves on a whim
and regret it later on paper. 

Now I see you in the window.
Are you in the book I was looking for? 

The one who traveled back to the happy days

when she could jump on a moving bus
and swing in the open air

clutching a worn novel in her purse . . . ?
A curtain, a knife, adoring eyes?


*     *     *


I watched the children running
and turned to Alyosha for a blessing.

He was sunk in the morass
of rural life

I like to sit with him in the grass.

Then we see the same thing at the same time,
and are one mind.

We two masses, one a book, one a hand.

When Alyosha spoke to the boys at the end
I anticipated their next question and his answer

For they formed a single gesture
of kindness.

"Will we? "We will.


*     *     *


It seemed evil to read about people
we would never meet.
We tested their fortitude as if in sleep.
They generally failed the challenge
being strangers in a strange brain.

They were baffled by the tools
handed to them and by the traffic's direction.
Frankly in a dream or story,
the goal is absolutely hidden
from the one to whom it matters.


*     *     *


Eons of lily-building 
emerged in that one flower.
Eons, eons. Pins
and wool, thread and needle,
all material
made of itself and circumstance.

It was a terrible century:
consisting of blasted
oil refineries and stuck ducks,
fish with their lips sealed by plastic
and tar in the hair of cooks.
Filth had penetrated the vents.

Institutions moan.
Balls of used cotton
from the hospital dumpster, redden.
Yawning on obsolescence
the computer wonders

who punched in such poor grammar.
First-padded virgins
graduate to this suffering drama
all by her-selves.
Who once were cells.

History is more than just another surmising
grandmother at a window 
or a reminiscence twisted in the scrim of translation.

Some long-ago light is pulsating in a trout's heart 
on a laboratory dish. 

That light has entered all the holes,
no matter how small, because it is the light that wants to live.


*     *     *


Still waiting for you my sunshine
of justice and mercy.

If west is east of Moscow,
depending where you're going

then will you ever find me
coming from a northerly direction? 

Are you even looking at the earth?
Remember the map is flat but everything else is not.

Is the newest child the oldest body in creation?

Does he carry more information than his mother?

Does her mother, his grandmother, do I seem redundant
by having arrived with less, though first?

Is that why I read at night with my lips compressed?


*     *     *


The fact is, I never knew if anyone felt me
the way Nijinsky knew how to feel.

Or Nastasya. Nothing could shock that woman
who had done so much wrong.

As if trained in a theater, multiple personalities
streamed from her tongue.

This made her an exemplar for our time.

She knew how others felt and became each one,
forgetting who she was before.

I remember her as a child. 

Her skirt got tangled up
in a thorn bush when she watched the sky.

Shaking herself free,
she had to see the spiders, ants and dirt
around her skirt, 

It was like peering into her own body
and she screamed in horror.

Later, consolation
would be extended by a man dark and handsome: 

It came with his semen
(when she wanted hibernation).

She didn't commit suicide this time, but ran
down Nevsky Prospekt as it began to rain,

and paused to lift her umbrella. 
For this moment

we were in our soul a child
rushing home to granny five floors up. 


*     *     *


I dropped the book, wept and went to the movies.

It is here where I can forgive someone for his crime.

Poisoning babies for profit. Harry Lime.

I can actually forgive it when he is crawling in shit.

Otherwise we will stand on the ferris wheel together forever
stuck in the fog and iron.

I just a witness to his ironic story 

He will be a mix between Paul Celan and Oscar Levant
when we are at our happiest
and no forgiveness is asked.

Neurotic, pale, and drawn to the canals,
we will lean over the embankment like sister and brother

who are tempted to be actors.

It is here that his shoes and cat
will converge in the dark. Like fish in a secular city

flipping through sewers for a flash of Christ.





The Shepheardes Calender: January
 

Januarie. gloga prima. ARGVMENT.

    IN this fyrst glogue Colin clout a shepheardes boy complaineth him of his vnfortunate loue, being but newly (as semeth) enamoured of a countrie lasse called Rosalinde: with which strong affection being very sore traueled, he compareth his carefull case to the sadde season of the yeare, to the frostie ground, to the frosen trees, and to his owne winterbeaten flocke. And lastlye, fynding himselfe robbed of all former pleasaunce and delights, hee breaketh his Pipe in peeces, and casteth him selfe to the ground.


COLIN Cloute.


A Shepeheards boye (no better doe him call) 
when Winters wastful spight was almost spent, 
All in a sunneshine day, as did befall, 
Led forth his flock, that had been long ypent. 
So faynt they woxe, and feeble in the folde, 
That now vnnethes their feete could them vphold. 


All as the Sheepe, such was the shepeheards looke, 
For pale and wanne he was, (alas the while,) 
May seeme he lovd, or els some care he tooke: 
Well couth he tune his pipe, and frame his stile. 
Tho to a hill his faynting flocke he ledde, 
And thus him playnd, the while his shepe there fedde. 


Ye gods of loue, that pitie louers payne, 
(if any gods the paine of louers pitie:) 
Looke from aboue, where you in ioyes remaine, 
And bowe your eares vnto my doleful dittie. 
And Pan thou shepheards God, that once didst loue, 
Pitie the paines, that thou thy selfe didst proue. 


Thou barrein ground, whome winters wrath hath wasted, 
Art made a myrrhour, to behold my plight: 
Whilome thy fresh spring flowrd, and after hasted 
Thy sommer prowde with Daffadillies dight. 
And now is come thy wynters stormy state, 
Thy mantle mard, wherein thou mas-kedst late. 


Such rage as winters, reigneth in my heart, 
My life bloud friesing wtih vnkindly cold: 
Such stormy stoures do breede my balefull smarte, 
As if my yeare were wast, and woxen old. 
And yet alas, but now my spring begonne, 
And yet alas, yt is already donne. 


You naked trees, whose shady leaves are lost, 
Wherein the byrds were wont to build their bowre: 
And now are clothd with mosse and hoary frost, 
Instede of bloosmes, wherwith your buds did flowre: 
I see your teares, that from your boughes doe raine, 
Whose drops in drery ysicles remaine. 


All so my lustfull leafe is drye and sere, 
My timely buds with wayling all are wasted: 
The blossome, which my braunch of youth did beare, 
With breathed sighes is blowne away, & blasted, 
And from mine eyes the drizling teares descend, 
As on your boughes the ysicles depend. 


Thou feeble flocke, whose fleece is rough and rent, 
Whose knees are weak through fast and evill fare: 
Mayst witnesse well by thy ill gouernement, 
Thy maysters mind is ouercome with care. 
Thou weak, I wanne: thou leabe, I quite forlorne: 
With mourning pyne I, you with pyning mourne. 


A thousand sithes I curse that carefull hower, 
Wherein I longd the neighbour towne to see: 
And eke tenne thousand sithes I blesse the stoure, 
Wherein I sawe so fayre a sight, as shee. 
Yet all for naught: snch [such] sight hath bred my bane. 
Ah God, that loue should breede both ioy and payne. 


It is not Hobbinol, wherefore I plaine, 
Albee my loue he seeke with dayly suit: 
His clownish gifts and curtsies I disdaine, 
His kiddes, his cracknelles, and his early fruit. 
Ah foolish Hobbinol, thy gyfts bene vayne: 
Colin them gives to Rosalind againe. 


I loue thilke lasse, (alas why doe I loue?) 
And am forlorne, (alas why am I lorne?) 
Shee deignes not my good will, but doth reproue, 
And of my rurall musick holdeth scorne. 
Shepheards deuise she hateth as the snake, 
And laughes the songes, that Colin Clout doth make. 


Wherefore my pype, albee rude Pan thou please, 
Yet for thou pleasest not, where most I would: 
And thou vnlucky Muse, that wontst to ease 
My musing mynd, yet canst not, when thou should: 
Both pype and Muse, shall sore the while abye. 
So broke his oaten pype, and downe dyd lye. 


By that, the welked Phoebus gan availe, 
His weary waine, and nowe the frosty Night 
Her mantle black through heauen gan overhaile. 
Which seene, the pensife boy halfe in despight 
Arose, and homeward drove his sonned sheepe, 
Whose hanging heads did seeme his carefull case to weepe.








A Winter Song
 

Came the dread Archer up yonder lawn --
Night is the time for the old to die --
But woe for an arrow that smote the fawn,
When the hind that was sick unscathed went by.

Father lay moaning, Her fault was sore
(Night is the time when the old must die),
Yet, ah to bless her, my child, once more,
For heart is failing: the end is nigh.

Daughter, my daughter, my girl, I cried
(Night is the time for the old to die)
Woe for the wish if till morn ye bide --
Dark was the welkin and wild the sky.

Heavily plunged from the roof the snow --
(Night is the time when the old will die),
She answered, My mother, 'tis well, I go.
Sparkled the north star, the wrack flew high.

First at his head, and last at his feet
(Night is the time when the old should die),
Kneeling I watched till his soul did fleet,
None else that loved him, none else were nigh.

I wept in the night as the desolate weep
(Night is the time for the old to die),
Cometh my daughter? the drifts are deep,
Across the cold hollows how white they lie.

I sought her afar through the spectral trees
(Night is the time when the old must die),
The fells were all muffled, the floods did freeze,
And a wrathful moon hung red in the sky.

By night I found her where pent waves steal
(Night is the time when the old should die),
But she lay stiff by the locked mill-wheel,
And the old stars lived in their homes on high.





On the Grasshopper and Cricket
 

The Poetry of earth is never dead:    
  When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,    
  And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run    
From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;    
That is the Grasshopper's--he takes the lead       
  In summer luxury,--he has never done    
  With his delights; for when tired out with fun    
He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.    
The poetry of earth is ceasing never:    
  On a lone winter evening, when the frost      
    Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills    
The Cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,    
  And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,    
    The Grasshopper's among some grassy hills.





Winter: A Dirge
 

The wintry west extends his blast,
And hail and rain does blaw;
Or, the stormy north sends driving forth
The blinding sleet and snaw:
While tumbling brown, the burn comes down,
And roars frae bank to brae;
And bird and beast in covert rest,
And pass the heartless day.

The sweeping blast, the sky o'ercast,
The joyless winter-day,
Let others fear, to me more dear
Than all the pride of May:
The tempest's howl, it soothes my soul,
My griefs it seems to join;
The leafless trees my fancy please,
Their fate resembles mine!

Thou Pow'r Supreme, whose mighty scheme
These woes of mine fulfil,
Here, firm, I rest, they must be best,
Because they are Thy will!
Then all I want (O, do Thou grant
This one request of mine!)
Since to enjoy Thou dost deny,
Assist me to resign.





Bleak Weather
 

Dear love, where the red lillies blossomed and grew,
The white snows are falling;
And all through the wood, where I wandered with you,
The loud winds are calling;
And the robin that piped to us tune upon tune,
Neath the elm--you remember,
Over tree-top and mountain has followed the June,
And left us--December.

Has left, like a friend that is true in the sun,
And false in the shadows.
He has found new delights, in the land where he's gone,
Greener woodlands and meadows.
What care we? let him go! let the snow shroud the lea,
Let it drift on the heather!
We can sing through it all; I have you--you have me,
And we'll laugh at the weather.

The old year may die, and a new one be born
That is bleaker and colder;
But it cannot dismay us; we dare it--we scorn,
For love makes us bolder.
Ah Robin! sing loud on the far-distant lea,
Thou friend in fair weather;
But here is a song sung, that's fuller of glee,
By two warm hearts together.





The Snow Fairy
 

      I 

Throughout the afternoon I watched them there, 
Snow-fairies falling, falling from the sky, 
Whirling fantastic in the misty air, 
Contending fierce for space supremacy. 
And they flew down a mightier force at night, 
As though in heaven there was revolt and riot, 
And they, frail things had taken panic flight 
Down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet. 
I went to bed and rose at early dawn 
To see them huddled together in a heap, 
Each merged into the other upon the lawn, 
Worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep. 
The sun shone brightly on them half the day, 
By night they stealthily had stol'n away. 


     II 

And suddenly my thoughts then turned to you 
Who came to me upon a winter's night, 
When snow-sprites round my attic window flew, 
Your hair disheveled, eyes aglow with light. 
My heart was like the weather when you came, 
The wanton winds were blowing loud and long; 
But you, with joy and passion all aflame, 
You danced and sang a lilting summer song. 
I made room for you in my little bed, 
Took covers from the closet fresh and warm, 
A downful pillow for your scented head, 
And lay down with you resting in my arm. 
You went with Dawn. You left me ere the day, 
The lonely actor of a dreamy play. 






Winter Stars
 

I went out at night alone;
 The young blood flowing beyond the sea
Seemed to have drenched my spirit's wings--
 I bore my sorrow heavily.

But when I lifted up my head
 From shadows shaken on the snow,
I saw Orion in the east
 Burn steadily as long ago.

From windows in my father's house,
 Dreaming my dreams on winter nights,
I watched Orion as a girl
 Above another city's lights.

Years go, dreams go, and youth goes too,
 The world's heart breaks beneath its wars,
All things are changed, save in the east
 The faithful beauty of the stars.





The Oxen
 

Christmas Eve, and twelve of the clock.
"Now they are all on their knees,
An elder said as we sat in a flock
By the embers in hearthside ease.

We pictured the meek mild creatures where
They dwelt in their strawy pen,
Nor did it occur to one of us there
To doubt they were kneeling then.

So fair a fancy few would weave
In these years! Yet, I feel,
If someone said on Christmas Eve,
"Come; see the oxen kneel,

"In the lonely barton by yonder coomb
Our childhood used to know,
I should go with him in the gloom,
Hoping it might be so.





In the bleak midwinter
 

In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day,
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, whom angels fall before,
The ox and ass and camel which adore.

Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.

What can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.





Somebody Trying
 

That creep Tolstoy,' she sobbed.
He. . . He. . . couldn't even. . .'
Something about his brother dying.

The serfs' punishments
have not ceased to suppurate on their backs.
Woodlots. People. Someone crying

under the yellow
autumn birchgrove drove him
wild: A new set of resolves:

When gambling, that almost obsolete fever,
or three days with the gypsies
sparked him into pure ego, he could,

just the same, write home, Sell them.'
It's true. Still,' (someone who loved her said,
cold and firm while she dissolved,

hypocrite, in self disgust, lectrice)
Still, he kept on. He wrote
all that he wrote; and seems to have understood

better than most of us:
to be human isn't easy. It's not
easy to be a serf or a master and learn

that art. It takes nerve. Bastard. Fink.
Yet the grief
trudging behind his funeral, he earned.'





Mayakovsky
 

1
My heart's aflutter!
I am standing in the bath tub
crying. Mother, mother
who am I? If he
will just come back once
and kiss me on the face
his coarse hair brush
my temple, it's throbbing!

then I can put on my clothes
I guess, and walk the streets.

2
I love you. I love you,
but I'm turning to my verses
and my heart is closing
like a fist.

Words! be
sick as I am sick, swoon,
roll back your eyes, a pool,

and I'll stare down
at my wounded beauty
which at best is only a talent
for poetry.

Cannot please, cannot charm or win
what a poet!
and the clear water is thick

with bloody blows on its head.
I embrace a cloud,
but when I soared
it rained.

3
That's funny! there's blood on my chest
oh yes, I've been carrying bricks
what a funny place to rupture!
and now it is raining on the ailanthus
as I step out onto the window ledge
the tracks below me are smoky and
glistening with a passion for running
I leap into the leaves, green like the sea

4
Now I am quietly waiting for 
the catastrophe of my personality
to seem beautiful again,
and interesting, and modern.

The country is grey and
brown and white in trees,
snows and skies of laughter
always diminishing, less funny
not just darker, not just grey.

It may be the coldest day of
the year, what does he think of
that? I mean, what do I? And if I do,
perhaps I am myself again.





Leviathan
 

Truth also is the pursuit of it:
Like happiness, and it will not stand.

Even the verse begins to eat away
In the acid. Pursuit, pursuit;

A wind moves a little,
Moving in a circle, very cold.

How shall we say?
In ordinary discourse--

We must talk now. I am no longer sure of the words,
The clockwork of the world. What is inexplicable

Is the preponderance of objects.' The sky lights
Daily with that predominance

And we have become the present.

We must talk now. Fear
Is fear. But we abandon one another.






Five Poems about Poetry
 

1

                               THE GESTURE

The question is: how does one hold an apple
Who likes apples

And how does one handle
Filth? The question is

How does one hold something
In the mind which he intends

To grasp and how does the salesman
Hold a bauble he intends 

To sell? The question is
When will there not be a hundred

Poets who mistake that gesture
For a style.


2

                           THE LITTLE HOLE

The little hole in the eye
Williams called it, the little hole

Has exposed us naked
To the world

And will not close.

Blankly the world
Looks in

And we compose
Colors

And the sense

Of home
And there are those

In it so violent
And so alone

They cannot rest.


3

                                  THAT LAND

Sing like a bird at the open
Sky, but no bird
Is a man--

Like the grip
Of the Roman hand
On his shoulder, the certainties

Of place
And of time

Held him, I think
With the pain and the casual horror
Of the iron and may have left
No hope of doubt

Whereas we have won doubt
From the iron itself

And hope in death. So that
If a man lived forever he would outlive
Hope. I imagine open sky

Over Gethsemane,
Surely it was this sky.


4

                                   PAROUSIA

Impossible to doubt the world: it can be seen
And because it is irrevocable

It cannot be understood, and I believe that fact is lethal

And man may find his catastrophe,
His Millennium of obsession.

                                            air moving,
a stone on a stone,
something balanced momentarily, in time might the lion

Lie down in the forest, less fierce
And solitary

Than the world, the walls
Of whose future may stand forever.


5

                               FROM VIRGIL

I, says the buzzard,
I--

Mind

Has evolved
Too long

If life is a search
For advantage.'

At whose behest

Does the mind think?' Art
Also is not good

For us
Unless like the fool

Persisting
In his folly

It may rescue us
As only the true

Might rescue us, gathered
In the smallest corners

Of man's triumph. Parve puer . . . Begin,

O small boy,
To be born;

On whom his parents have not smiled

No god thinks worthy of his table,
No goddess of her bed'






Of Being Numerous: Sections 1-22
 

1

There are things
We live among and to see them
Is to know ourselves'.

Occurrence, a part
Of an infinite series,

The sad marvels;

Of this was told
A tale of our wickedness.
It is not our wickedness.

You remember that old town we went to, and we sat in the ruined window, and we tried to imagine that we belonged to those times--It is dead and it is not dead, and you cannot imagine either its life or its death; the earth speaks and the salamander speaks, the Spring comes and only obscures it--'


2

So spoke of the existence of things,
An unmanageable pantheon

Absolute, but they say
Arid.

A city of the corporations

Glassed
In dreams

And images--

And the pure joy
Of the mineral fact

Tho it is impenetrable

As the world, if it is matter,
Is impenetrable.


3

The emotions are engaged
Entering the city
As entering any city.

We are not coeval
With a locality
But we imagine others are,

We encounter them. Actually
A populace flows
Thru the city.

This is a language, therefore, of New York


4

For the people of that flow
Are new, the old

New to age as the young
To youth

And to their dwelling
For which the tarred roofs

And the stoops and doors--
A world of stoops--
Are petty alibi and satirical wit
Will not serve. 


5

The great stone
Above the river
In the pylon of the bridge

1875'

Frozen in the moonlight
In the frozen air over the footpath, consciousness

Which has nothing to gain, which awaits nothing,
Which loves itself


6

We are pressed, pressed on each other,
We will be told at once
Of anything that happens

And the discovery of fact bursts
In a paroxysm of emotion
Now as always.   Crusoe

We say was
Rescued'.
So we have chosen.


7

Obsessed, bewildered

By the shipwreck
Of the singular

We have chosen the meaning
Of being numerous.


8

Amor fati
The love of fate

For which the city alone
Is audience

Perhaps blasphemous.

Slowly over islands, destinies
Moving steadily pass
And change

In the thin sky
Over islands

Among days

Having only the force
Of days

Most simple
Most difficult


9

Whether, as the intensity of seeing increases, one's distance from Them, the people, does not also increase'
I know, of course I know, I can enter no other place

Yet I am one of those who from nothing but man's way of thought and one of his dialects and what has happened to me
Have made poetry

To dream of that beach
For the sake of an instant in the eyes,

The absolute singular

The unearthly bonds
Of the singular

Which is the bright light of shipwreck


10

Or, in that light, New arts! Dithyrambic, audience-as-artists! But I will listen to a man, I will listen to a man, and when I speak I will speak, tho he will fail and I will fail. But I will listen to him speak. The shuffling of a crowd is nothing--well, nothing but the many that we are, but nothing.

Urban art, art of the cities, art of the young in the cities--The isolated man is dead, his world around him exhausted

And he fails! He fails, that meditative man! And indeed they cannot bear' it.


11

            it is that light
Seeps anywhere, a light for the times

In which the buildings
Stand on low ground, their pediments
Just above the harbor

Absolutely immobile,

Hollow, available, you could enter any building,
You could look from any window
One might wave to himself
From the top of the Empire State Building--


Speak


If you can


Speak


Phyllis--not neo-classic,
The girl's name is Phyllis--

Coming home from her first job
On the bus in the bare civic interior
Among those people, the small doors
Opening on the night at the curb
Her heart, she told me, suddenly tight with happiness--

So small a picture,
A spot of light on the curb, it cannot demean us

I too am in love down there with the streets
And the square slabs of pavement--

To talk of the house and the neighborhood and the docks

And it is not art'


12

In these explanations it is presumed that an experiencing subject is one occasion of a sensitive reaction to an actual world.'

the rain falls
that had not been falling
and it is the same world

. . .

They made small objects
Of wood and the bones of fish
And of stone. They talked,
Families talked,
They gathered in council
And spoke, carrying objects.
They were credulous,
Their things shone in the forest.

They were patient
With the world.
This will never return, never,
Unless having reached their limits

They will begin over, that is,
Over and over


13

           unable to begin
At the beginning, the fortunate
Find everything already here. They are shoppers,
Choosers, judges; . . . And here the brutal
is without issue, a dead end.
                                            They develop
Argument in order to speak, they become
unreal, unreal, life loses
solidity, loses extent, baseball's their game
because baseball is not a game
but an argument and difference of opinion
makes the horse races. They are ghosts that endanger

One's soul. There is change
In an air
That smells stale, they will come to the end
Of an era
First of all peoples
And one may honorably keep

His distance
If he can.


14

I cannot even now
Altogether disengage myself
From those men

With whom I stood in emplacements, in mess tents,
In hospitals and sheds and hid in the gullies
Of blasted roads in a ruined country,

Among them many men
More capable than I--

Muykut and a sergeant
Named Healy,
That lieutenant also--

How forget that? How talk
Distantly of The People'

Who are that force
Within the walls
Of cities

Wherein their cars

Echo like history
Down walled avenues
In which one cannot speak.


15

Chorus (androgynous): Find me
So that I will exist, find my navel
So that it will exist, find my nipples
So that they will exist, find every hair
Of my belly, I am good (or I am bad),
Find me.'


16

. . . he who will not work shall not eat,
and only he who was troubled shall find rest,
and only he who descends into the nether world shall rescue his beloved,
and only he who unsheathes his knife shall be given Isaac again. He who will not work shall not eat. . .
but he who will work shall give birth to his own father.'


17

The roots of words
Dim in the subways

There is madness in the number
Of the living
A state of matter'

There is nobody here but us chickens

Anti-ontology--

He wants to say
His life is real,
No one can say why

It is not easy to speak

A ferocious mumbling, in public
Of rootless speech


18

It is the air of atrocity,
An event as ordinary
As a President.

A plume of smoke, visible at a distance
In which people burn.


19

Now in the helicopters the casual will
Is atrocious

Insanity in high places,
If it is true we must do these things
We must cut our throats

The fly in the bottle

Insane, the insane fly

Which, over the city
Is the bright light of shipwreck


20

--They await

War, and the news
Is war

As always

That the juices may flow in them
Tho the juices lie.

Great things have happened
On the earth and given it history, armies
And the ragged hordes moving and the passions
Of that death. But who escapes
Death

Among these riders
Of the subway,

They know
But now as I know

Failure and the guilt
Of failure.
As in Hardy's poem of Christmas

We might half-hope to find the animals
In the sheds of a nation
Kneeling at midnight,

Farm animals,
Draft animals, beasts for slaughter
Because it would mean they have forgiven us,
Or which is the same thing,
That we do not altogether matter.


21

There can be a brick
In a brick wall
They eye picks

So quiet of a Sunday
Here is the brick, it was waiting
Here when you were born

Mary-Anne.


22

Clarity

In the sense of transparence,
I don't mean that much can be explained

Clarity in the sense of silence.

THE TRANSLUCENT MECHANICS

Combed thru the piers the wind
Moves in the clever city
Not in the doors but the hinges
Finds the secret of motion
As tho the hollow ships moved in their voices,   murmurs
Flaws
In the wind
Fear        fear
At the lumber mastheads
And fetched a message out of the sea again

Say angel                say powers

Obscurely   things
And the self'

Prosody

Sings

In the stones

          to entrust
To a poetry of statement

At close quarters

A living mind
and that one's own'

                  what then             what spirit

Of the bent seas

                  Archangel

of the tide
brimming

in the moon-streak

                  comes in whose absence
earth crumbles


6

Silver as
The needle's eye

Of the horizon in the noise
Of their entrance row on row the waves
Move landward        conviction's

Net of branches
In the horde of events the sacred swarm avalanche
Masked in the sunset

Needle after needle more numerous than planets

Or the liquid waves
In the tide rips

We believe       we believe

Beyond the cable car streets
And the picture window

Lives the glittering crumbling night
Of obstructions and the stark structures

That carry wires over the mountain
One writes in the presence of something
Moving close to fear
I dare pity no one
Let the rafters pity
The air in the room
Under the rafters
Pity
In the continual sound
Are chords
Not yet struck
Which will be struck
Nevertheless yes


7

O withering seas
Of the doorstep and local winds unveil

The face of art

Carpenter, plunge and drip in the sea       Art's face
We know that face

More blinding than the sea    a haunted house    a limited

Consensus unwinding

Its powers
Toward the thread's end

In the record of great blows   shocks
Ravishment   devastation   the wood splintered

The keyboard gone in the rank grass swept her hand
Over the strings and the thing rang out

Over the rocks and the ocean
Not my poem   Mr Steinway's

Poem   Not mine   A marvelous' object
Is not the marvel of things

                twisting the new
Mouth   forcing the new
Tongue   But it rang


8

THE TASTE

Old ships are preserved
For their queer silence of obedient seas
Their cutwaters floating in the still water
With their cozy black iron work
And Swedish seamen dead    the cabins
Hold the spaces of their deaths
And the hammered nails of necessity
Carried thru the oceans
Where the moon rises grandly
In the grandeur of cause
We have a taste for bedrock
Beneath this spectacle
To gawk at
Something is wrong with the antiques, a black fluid
Has covered them, a black splintering
Under the eyes of young wives
People talk wildly, we are beginning to talk wildly, the wind
At every summit
Our overcoats trip us
Running for the bus
Our arms stretched out
In a wind from what were sand dunes


9

THE IMPOSSIBLE POEM

Climbing the peak of Tamalpais the loose
Gravel underfoot

And the city shining with the tremendous wrinkles
In the hills and the winding of the bay
Behind it, it faces the bent ocean

Streetcars
Rocked thru the city and the winds
Combed their clumsy sides

In clumsy times

Sierras withering
Behind the storefronts

And sanity the roadside weed
Dreams of sports and sportsmanship

In the lucid towns paralyzed
Under the truck tires
Shall we relinquish

Sanity to redeem
Fragments and fragmentary
Histories in the towns and the temperate streets
Too shallow still to drown in or to mourn
The courageous and precarious children


10

BUT SO AS BY FIRE

The darkness of trees
Guards this life
Of the thin ground
That covers the rock ledge

Among the lanes and magic
Of the Eastern woods

The beauty of silence
And broken boughs

And the homes of small animals

The green leaves
Of young plants
Above the dark green moss
In the sweet smell of rot

The pools and the trickle of freshwater

First life,   rotting life
Hidden starry life it is not yet

A mirror
Like our lives

We have gone
As far as is possible

Whose lives reflect light
Like mirrors

One had not thought
To be afraid

Not of shadow but of light

Summon one's powers






Spring Snow
 

Here comes the powdered milk I drank
as a child, and the money it saved.
Here come the papers I delivered,
the spotted dog in heat that followed me home

and the dogs that followed her.
Here comes a load of white laundry
from basketball practice, and sheets
with their watermarks of semen.

And here comes snow, a language
in which no word is ever repeated,
love is impossible, and remorse. . . .
Yet childhood doesn't end,

but accumulates, each memory
knit to the next, and the fields
become one field. If to die is to lose
all detail, then death is not

so distinguished, but a profusion
of detail, a last gossip, character
passed wholly into fate and fate
in flecks, like dust, like flour, like snow.





Living Among the Dead
 

There is another world,but it is in this one.                    Paul Eluard

First there were those who died
before I was born.
It was as if they had just left
and their shadows would
slip out after them
under the door so recently closed
the air in its path was still
swirling to rest.
Some of the furniture came from them,
I was told, and one day
I opened two chests
of drawers to learn what the dead kept.

But it was when I learned to read
that I began always 
to live among the dead.
I remember Rapunzel,
the improved animals
in the Just-So Stories, and a flock
of birds that saved themselves
from a hunter by flying in place
in the shape of a tree,
their wings imitating the whisk
of wind in the leaves.

My sons and I are like some wine
the dead have already bottled.
They wish us well, but there is nothing
they can do for us.
Sebastian cries in his sleep,
I bring him into my bed,
talk to him, rub his back.
To help his sons live easily
among the dead is a father's great work.
Now Sebastian drifts, soon he'll sleep.
We can almost hear the dead
breathing. They sound like water
under a ship at sea.

To love the dead is easy.
They are final, perfect.
But to love a child
is sometimes to fail at love
while the dead look on
with their abstract sorrow.

To love a child is to turn
away from the patient dead.
It is to sleep carefully
in case he cries.

Later, when my sons are grown
among their own dead, I can
dive easily into sleep and loll
among the coral of my dreams
growing on themselves
until at the end 
I almost never dream of anyone,
except my sons,
who is still alive.





Left Hand Canyon
 

                           for Richard Hugo

The Rev. Royal Filkin preaches
tomorrow on why we are sad.
Brethren, Montana's a landscape
requiring faith: the visible
government arrives in trucks,
if you live out far enough.
If you live in town, the government's 
gone, on errands, in trucks.

Let citizens go to meetings,
I'll stay home. I hate a parade.
By the time you get the trout
up through the tiny triangular
holes in the Coors cans, they're so
small you have to throw them back.
Glum miles we go
to Grandmother's house.

The earth out here doesn't bear us
up so much as it keeps us out,
an old trick of the beautiful.
Remember what Chief Left Hand said?
Never mind. Everything else
was taken from him,
let's leave his grief alone.
My Eastern friends ask me

how I like it in the West,
or God's country, as it's sometimes
called, though God, like a slumlord,
lives in the suburbs: Heaven.
And I don't live "in the West;
I live in this canyon among a few
other houses and abandoned
mines, vaccinations that didn't take.





In Memory of the Utah Stars
 

Each of them must have terrified
his parents by being so big, obsessive
and exact so young, already gone
and leaving, like a big tipper,
that huge changeling's body in his place.
The prince of bone spurs and bad knees.

The year I first saw them play
Malone was a high school freshman,
already too big for any bed,
14, a natural resource.
You have to learn not to
apologize, a form of vanity.
You flare up in the lane, exotic
anywhere else. You roll the ball
off fingers twice as long as your
girlfriend's. Great touch for a big man,
says some jerk. Now they're defunct
and Moses Malone, boy wonder at 19,
rises at 20 from the St. Louis bench,
his pet of a body grown sullen
as fast as it grew up.

Something in you remembers every 
time the ball left your fingertips
wrong and nothing the ball 
can do in the air will change that.
You watch it set, stupid moon,
the way you watch yourself
in a recurring dream.
You never lose your touch
or forget how taxed bodies
go at the same pace they owe,
how brutally well the universe
works to be beautiful,
how we metabolize loss
as fast as we have to.





Foul Shots: A Clinic
 

                                for Paul Levitt

Be perpendicular to the basket,
toes avid for the line.

Already this description
is perilously abstract: the ball
and basket are round, the nailhead
centered in the centerplank
of the foul-circle is round,
and though the rumpled body
isn't round, it isn't
perpendicular. You have to draw
"an imaginary line, as the breezy

coaches say, "through your shoulders.
Here's how to cheat: remember
your collarbone. Now the instructions
grow spiritual--deep breathing,
relax and concentrate both; aim
for the front of the rim but miss it
deliberately so the ball goes in.
Ignore this part of the clinic

and shoot 200 foul shots
every day. Teach yourself not to be
bored by any boring one of them.
You have to love to do this, and chances
are you don't; you'd love to be good
at it but not by a love that drives
you to shoot 200 foul shots
every day, and the lovingly unlaunched
foul shots we're talking about now--
the clinic having served to bring us
together--circle eccentrically
in a sky of stolid orbits
as unlike as you and I are
from the arcs those foul shots
leave behind when they go in.





How Much?
 

How much do you love me, a million bushels?
Oh, a lot more than that, Oh, a lot more.

And tomorrow maybe only half a bushel?
Tomorrow maybe not even a half a bushel.

And is this your heart arithmetic?
This is the way the wind measures the weather.






Buffalo Dusk
 

The buffaloes are gone.
And those who saw the buffaloes are gone.
Those who saw the buffaloes by thousands and how they pawed the prairie sod into dust with their hoofs, their great heads down pawing on in a great pageant of dusk,
Those who saw the buffaloes are gone.
And the buffaloes are gone.





Wilderness
 

There is a wolf in me . . . fangs pointed for tearing gashes . . . a red tongue for raw meat . . . and the hot lapping of blood--I keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me and the wilderness will not let it go.    

There is a fox in me . . . a silver-gray fox . . . I sniff and guess . . . I pick things out of the wind and air . . . I nose in the dark night and take sleepers and eat them and hide the feathers . . . I circle and loop and double-cross.

There is a hog in me . . . a snout and a belly . . . a machinery for eating and grunting . . . a machinery for sleeping satisfied in the sun--I got this too from the wilderness and the wilderness will not let it go.

There is a fish in me . . . I know I came from salt-blue water-gates . . . I scurried with shoals of herring . . . I blew waterspouts with porpoises . . . before land was . . . before the water went down . . . before Noah . . . before the first chapter of Genesis.

There is a baboon in me . . . clambering-clawed . . . dog-faced . . . yawping a galoot's hunger . . . hairy under the armpits . . . here are the hawk-eyed hankering men . . . here are the blonde and blue-eyed women . . . here they hide curled asleep waiting . . . ready to snarl and kill . . . ready to sing and give milk . . . waiting--I keep the baboon because the wilderness says so.

There is an eagle in me and a mockingbird . . . and the eagle flies among the Rocky Mountains of my dreams and fights among the Sierra crags of what I want . . . and the mockingbird warbles in the early forenoon before the dew is gone, warbles in the underbrush of my Chattanoogas of hope, gushes over the blue Ozark foothills of my wishes--And I got the eagle and the mockingbird from the wilderness.

O, I got a zoo, I got a menagerie, inside my ribs, under my bony head, under my red-valve heart--and I got something else: it is a man-child heart, a woman-child heart: it is a father and mother and lover: it came from God-Knows-Where: it is going to God-Knows-Where--For I am the keeper of the zoo: I say yes and no: I sing and kill and work: I am a pal of the world: I came from the wilderness.





Mr. Attila
 

They made a myth of you, professor,
     you of the gentle voice,
     the books, the specs,
     the furitive rabbit manners
     in the mortar-board cap
     and the medieval gown.

They didn't think it, eh professor?
On account of you're so absent-minded,
you bumping into the tree and saying,
"Excuse me, I thought you were a tree,
passing on again blank and absent-minded.

Now it's "Mr. Attila, how do you do?
Do you pack wallops of wholesale death?
Are you the practical dynamic son-of-a-gun?
Have you come through with a few abstractions?
Is it you Mr. Attila we hear saying,
"I beg your pardon but we believe we have made some degree of progress on the residual qualities of the atom?

                                                                                 [August, 1945]





The Abracadabra Boys
 

The abracadabra boys--have they been in the stacks and cloisters? Have they picked up languages for throwing into chow mein poems?
Have they been to a sea of jargons and brought back jargons? Their salutations go: Who cometh? and, It ith I cometh.
They know postures from impostures, pistils from pustules, to hear them tell it. They foregather and make pitty pat with each other in Latin and in their private pig Latin, very ofay.
They give with passwords. "Who cometh? "A kumquat cometh. "And how cometh the kumquat? "On an abbadabba, ancient and honorable sire, ever and ever on an abbadabba.
Do they have fun? Sure--their fun is being what they are, like our fun is being what we are--only they are more sorry for us being what we are than we are for them being what they are.
Pointing at you, at us, at the rabble, they sigh and say, these abracadabra boys, "They lack jargons. They fail to distinguish between pustules and pistils. They knoweth not how the kumquat cometh.





Frozen In
 

                             Venice, December
                        Ours are the only mouths
                        to taste with this smothering slow
                        touch, and the only steps
                        to sink like bellsounds and cave
                        deep into the marble snow.
 
                        Women who go to the window
                        to push their arms out to the snow
                        and then bring the shutters back in
                        follow us as we fall
                        past their eyes where the black night lives.
 
                        We are snowflakes at last, as the thick
                        never locked, never closed doors
                        follow us through squares of light
                        their windows have left on the snow.
                        Once again, warmth that falls,
                        again, though our tracks fill and slow.





Winter Solstice Chant
 

Vines, leaves, roots of darkness, growing,
now you are uncurled and cover our eyes
with the edge of winter sky
leaning over us in icy stars.
Vines, leaves, roots of darkness, growing,
come with your seasons, your fullness, your end.





the lost baby poem
 

the time i dropped your almost body down
down to meet the waters under the city
and run one with the sewage to the sea
what did i know about waters rushing back
what did i know about drowning
or being drowned

you would have been born into winter
in the year of the disconnected gas
and no car       we would have made the thin
walk over genesee hill into the canada wind
to watch you slip like ice into strangers' hands
you would have fallen naked as snow into winter
if you were here i could tell you these
and some other things

if i am ever less than a mountain
for your definite brothers and sisters
let the rivers pour over my head
let the sea take me for a spiller
of seas        let black men call me stranger
always        for your never named sake





The Ballad of the Harp Weaver
 

"Son, said my mother,
  When I was knee-high,
"You've need of clothes to cover you,
  And not a rag have I.
 
"There's nothing in the house
  To make a boy breeches,
Nor shears to cut a cloth with
  Nor thread to take stitches.
 
"There's nothing in the house
  But a loaf-end of rye,
And a harp with a woman's head
  Nobody will buy,  And she began to cry.
 
That was in the early fall.
  When came the late fall,
"Son, she said, "the sight of you  
Makes your mother's blood crawl,
 
"Little skinny shoulder-blades
  Sticking through your clothes!
And where you'll get a jacket from
  God above knows.
 
"It's lucky for me, lad,
  Your daddy's in the ground,
And can't see the way I let
  His son go around!
  And she made a queer sound.
 
That was in the late fall.
  When the winter came,
I'd not a pair of breeches
  Nor a shirt to my name.
 
I couldn't go to school,
  Or out of doors to play.
And all the other little boys
  Passed our way.
 
"Son, said my mother,
  Come, climb into my lap,
And I'll chafe your little bones
  While you take a nap.
 
And, oh, but we were silly
  For half an hour or more,
Me with my long legs
  Dragging on the floor,
 
A-rock-rock-rocking
  To a mother-goose rhyme!
Oh, but we were happy
  For half an hour's time!
 
But there was I, a great boy,
  And what would folks say
To hear my mother singing me
  To sleep all day,
  In such a daft way?
 
Men say the winter
  Was bad that year;
Fuel was scarce,
  And food was dear.
 
A wind with a wolf's head
  Howled about our door,
And we burned up the chairs
  And sat upon the floor.
 
All that was left us
  Was a chair we couldn't break,
And the harp with a woman's head
  Nobody would take,
  For song or pity's sake.
 
The night before Christmas
  I cried with the cold,
I cried myself to sleep
  Like a two-year-old.
 
And in the deep night
  I felt my mother rise,
And stare down upon me
  With love in her eyes.
 
I saw my mother sitting
  On the one good chair,
A light falling on her
  From I couldn't tell where,
 
Looking nineteen,
  And not a day older,
And the harp with a woman's head
  Leaned against her shoulder.
 
Her thin fingers, moving
  In the thin, tall strings,
Were weav-weav-weaving
  Wonderful things.
 
Many bright threads,
  From where I couldn't see,
Were running through the harp-strings
  Rapidly,
 
And gold threads whistling
  Through my mother's hand.
I saw the web grow,
  And the pattern expand.
 
She wove a child's jacket,
  And when it was done
She laid it on the floor
  And wove another one.
 
She wove a red cloak
  So regal to see,
"She's made it for a king's son,
  I said, "and not for me.
  But I knew it was for me.
 
She wove a pair of breeches
  Quicker than that!
She wove a pair of boots
  And a little cocked hat.
 
She wove a pair of mittens,
  She wove a little blouse,
She wove all night
  In the still, cold house.
 
She sang as she worked,
  And the harp-strings spoke;
Her voice never faltered,
  And the thread never broke.
  And when I awoke,
 
There sat my mother
  With the harp against her shoulder
Looking nineteen
  And not a day older,
 
A smile about her lips,
  And a light about her head,
And her hands in the harp-strings
  Frozen dead.
 
And piled up beside her
  And toppling to the skies,
Were the clothes of a king's son,
  Just my size.





February
 

It is all kind of lovely that I know
what I attend here now the maturity of snow
has settled around forming a sort of time
pushing that other over either horizon and all is mine

in any colors to be chosen and
everything is cold and nothing is totally frozen

soon enough
the primary rough
erosion of what white fat it will occur
     stiff yellows O
beautiful beautifully austere
     be gotten down to, that much rash and achievement that
             would promote to, but

now I know my own red
network electrifying this welcome annual hush.





Sonnet for Alice N.
 

Why & what is sweetness all alone?
Either that or it becomes, alas, fleeting,
Which actually helps, because of rhythm.
& there's a pale intensity to truth, no matter
How pale it is on the levels we receive on.
I mean, the minute you invent a time interval
The more it seems to "jelly out the excitation
Of accidents; zum Beispiel, "Saginaw, Michigan.
            After a while, we almost expect him or her
To inveigle us into a cafe without bay-breasted warblers.
It's almost like we have a streak of orange-smell
Which nobody'll pay for because they can't talk to it,
Although that's probably all wrong, or at least falsified
By its very mention, like gravity. Do you agree?





Ecology
 

Surrounded by bone, surrounded by cells,
by rings, by rings of hell, by hair, surrounded by
air-is-a-thing, surrounded by silhouette, by honey-wet bees, yet
by skeletons of trees, surrounded by actual, yes, for practical
purposes, people, surrounded by surreal
popcorn, surrounded by the reborn: Surrender in the center
to surroundings. O surrender forever, never
end her, let her blend around, surrender to the surroundings that
surround the tender endo-surrender, that
tumble through the tumbling to that blue that
curls around the crumbling, to that, the blue that
rumbles under the sun bounding the pearl that
we walk on, talk on; we can chalk that
up to experience, sensing the brown here that's
blue now, a drop of water surrounding a cow that's
black & white, the warbling Blackburnian twitter that's
machining midnight orange in the light that's
glittering in the light green visible wind. That's
the ticket to the tunnel through the thicket that's
a cricket's funnel of music to correct & pick it out
from under the wing that whirls up over & out.

little report of the day
 

9:13 p.m., Lucky Bock in hand,
I inscribe: walked the lovely
33 blocks to school today, streets clear and
thick melting snow all around.
taught my 4 hours of poetry; the afternoon
class was hard; kid named Schweikert
kept on fucking up. took typed-up
poems of yesterday to Platt and put up
poster there of Anne and Reed's reading Sat.
ate nearly 2 peanutbutter sandwiches with
raw carrots. typed. read kids' poems.
at 4 I started home, got a ride
with Jim Bay. press release to daily paper.
stopped in Baird's for 2 beers,
looked at paper. home, kissed Mara, Sierra.
in the mail: Out There, from Chicago, and a letter
stating the city of Grand Island had decided not
to prosecute re my arrest
Friday for intoxication. wonder why. Nick
the landlord didn't show (he was supposed to
have us sign lease on the new duplex) (this place
gonna be torn down). ate
a very delicious supper, ham-and-cheese
rarebit with cold broccoli and cold oregano'd
tomato, cooked by Mara. paperwork, played a
game of solitaire, harried by Sierra's 
new red car. dropped over then
to the Korner Bar, put up a poster under the phone sign, said hi
to a few folks and got halloo'd by this guy I'd
spoken to 2 months before, who'd said his high
school son adored me, but it might be thought improper
that I hang around, shoot pool in Korner Bar.
a beefy mid-30's man, he bought me a beer, apologized and
told me of his luck: he'd won a thousand one-hundred eighty
dollars today betting on one horse at Fonner Park.
we talked of poetry, family, work -- he mentioned Kilmer,
Stevenson, Nash and others, quoted verbatim
his own published poem on fire-fighting (he is the G.I. 
fire-chief). his boyhood favorites, whom he reads all of
even now: Edgar Rice Burroughts and Jules Verne. his son,
though epileptic, does the high jump at the high school; he was
disturbed that it wasn't the broad jump, in which he
himself still holds a record, set in 1959.
the taxes have jumped up like crazy on their nice
spread just inside the city limits. I got up and
slapped him on the back and left, stopping first to ask
Clark, standing end of the bar, what he knew
of me on Friday night at the Kyriss. I'd blanked out
completely (woke up in jail, ate
blue oatmeal). he said I'd just got drunk, he thought Rod
had taken me home. he said, at one point,
just waking up, I'd grabbed the edge of the table and
tilted it till the glasses all came sliding
down and almost off, then tilted it back till they
slid back to where they were, and never spilled a drop.
he said I'd bought some beers for him and Pat but
before they could get to them drank
them up myself. okay, Clark, you're a good guy with your
black curly hair and toothless grin, and your wild life. I was just
wondering. check with Rod when have a chance. --
and off, through mud and occasionally-lighted puddles,
home, where Mara's napping still and there are (were) 
5 Lucky Bocks in the white (today!) icebox. 9:50.


           (no. 2)

after finishing that
(immediately after, during, in
fact) the
strange thing is there's so much left out.
last night finished reading
The Vicar of Wakefield. the bluejays and cardinals that called
on the way to school. my beard
suddenly seems soft (that thought
off some day-dreaming about talking to
poetry students). reread
(for the last "making time) "the 14, the magazine; it is
all set. the poems
there, here now, seemed so abstract,
compared with what I'm used to,
but that in a way intensely and properly shaking
feeling and talk, tonight. the
revolution
(Mara gets up, starts drinking Pepsi)
and all that. (yellow sweater).






Arguing with Something Plato Said
 

       (for Phil Garrison and Peter Lamborn Wilson)

      As ashes are the shadow of smoke,
      panic is the shadow of light,
      beef the shadow of grass,
      love the shadow of attention,
      psychology the shadow of plastic
      the shadow of oil the shadow
      of giant ferns the shadow of
      bacteria the shadow of light's grandmother,
      rosy finch the shadow of loon,
      jealousy & myth twin shadows of desire,
      Europe shadow of a desert river,
      idea the shadow of pain,
      sleep the shadow of bread,
      liquid the shadow of lust,
      time the shadow of
      et cetera,
logos is the shadow of what happens.

      Take some broad-shouldered little fart, at las-
t, fresh from the 5 o'clock (morn) shadow of barbarism,
squatting over barley-paste, hot goat, dried fig
      (meal the shadow --
              since the shadows were removed
              from rocky Grecian hills, trees cut away,
              soil reduced to olive grounds --
                   down to shadow of surroundings --
      of Homeric
      heaps of meat that cast deadanimal-shaped shadows
      by the tents on the sandy shores of Ilium)
      squatting over his shapeless shadow in the shadow of the Parthenon --
      itself

                                 organized ruckus in his medium, rare town, which,
                                 God knows, nobody there "thought would
                                 survive, a golden paradigm, for thousands of
                                 Apollonian twirls. Who knows what they thought
                                 of what they thought? It must've
      been intensely local; that
      the universe crept into
      valley code was just 
      brain refreshment. Dirt was all
      around. Some bright body shambled
      the streets -- in mud & heat -- barely
      shook his bald, Why is the sky
      blues into registration, virgin
      ears & experienced buttholes,
as the shadow of estrangement from
a bloody dream's red tape, & got chemicaled,
but Mr. Broad Wit seized
evaporation from the street to isolate
spirit of
spearmint from what had always gone before.
Summer was a-comin' in still (Lawdy!
sing coo-coo!), facts & symbols
be-danced & babblin'
beat of a million bovine feet
upon the tender luxury
      sidewinding from the brain.
            So he thought "Thought! Why not?
Natural! in a sense. Never before
had such perfect innocence been explored
like new property.
Well, such a new idea as "idea
looks pretty good till you can check out how it settles into the ground.
Blood's biodegradable but logos
piled up like a plastic eyesore, fore-
shadowed a bloodless dry reign,
precipitation of pedestrain pedantry,
pedestrian mind for millenia, postulating
its pustulations of post- & pre-, professing
everything, subjugating us all in the tick-tech
burned-out success of a nob objectivity,
turning babble to a soapy
bubble up up & away until pop!
goes the wizard.

Aw c'mon, the alchemy that pilfers
from golden sundance volumes of German silver
sucks tongue of essence --
ah yes, essence, with its can-do incandescence,
like "Lovelight's our leverage to spring some uptight average
from alla this quotidian sewage
& italicize it, boot it through the uprights
to an airy footnote.

So anyway this guy imagined up God outa the play-dough
of his panicked exclusions
& then compounded the felony by trying to imitate the damn thing,
double-indemnity solipsism in the fool's guise of cool & wise
utopian Republic! Razional! Sozialismus!
Computerized zoosphere! Hologram rain forest -- a more direct
use of light.
But despite all right & crystal wings, thinking
that -- "The-variability-of-the-world-has-no-more-reality-than-the-shadows-on-a-cave-wall--
has no more reality than
Plato's reflection in the waters
of a Theater-of-Dionysus Port-O-Let.

Well, he thought he was correting a mess
& left a mess of
shadows for our meat.
If unity really strung out from above,
not shot up from below, we'd have
no babies to throw out with
anybody's rationalized bathwater.

Islands in the stream
of biosphere placidly gavotte
drinking play-tonic sprinkled geo-
metrically, until the teleology
becomes archaic -- & eats it too.
The world pole-flips one more time, mechanically geo-
mantric, shakes the pants off of objective
dance to reveal gradual chance, just
numbers having a ball, as the rationale
of it all.

Back up a hemidemisecond! My better half
says -- "In the winter the house is all shadow.
But the long hot summer of essentialism
"was a system of no resistance --
& all the psychological shit that makes a
toilet contemplative, inner-directed: a pure good-bye.

Yet it was hard (abstract thought),
difficult to invent, like anything you can't
immediately step on, phrase or foot --

      (& 4 is the shadow of 3 is the shadow of 2 is the shadow of 1
      & old is the shadow of Jung
      & red is the shadow of orange
      & dots the shadow of dot
      & hand is the shadow of and
      however the shadow of breath
      & season the shadow of winter
      the step the shadow of the gesture
      & soprano is the shadow of the star
      & ring's shadow is "orange
      & window shadow of the shadow.)

--after all, Empedocles
& Anaximander had
illuminated life as shadows of whatever, up from sea-slime,
dissolving to the harmony of a sphere.

Logos, in the light, is only haze,
a honey-head, that the shape
be kept as "beautiful.

(& the shadow structure
is the real -- it's not being looked at
nor still distorted by leftover rays in the shadowee,
nor in such relation to light as shadowing implies:
once you've taken in the light,
you're artificially simple for good -- bedazzled.
Chiaroscuro conjures up dichotomy -- Step 1,
then, as it loses all idea to total presence,
becomes invisible enough.
& we're home.
Lightning strikes -- OK.
Half-known moves around the kitchen.
The cereal box is food for thought.
Is it easier to be right when you're already wrong?
Hmm, cool today; better pull on my dark-blue paradigm.
The quality of nothing is not strained,
but saying so's tense like a cartoon zebra.
"The variability of the world
-- incidental winks of it start to party into view --
absolutely hot & cool, at the moment,
is, & likely to remain so.)

The Other Fathers
 

would be coming back 
from some war, sending 
back stuffed birds or 
handkerchiefs in navy 
blue with Love painted  
on it. Some sent telegrams 
for birthdays, the pastel 
letters like jewels. The  
magazines were full of fathers who 
were doing what had 
to be done, were serving,  
were brave. Someone 
yelped there'd be confetti 
in the streets, maybe 
no school. That soon 
we'd have bananas. My 
father sat in the grey 
chair, war after war, 
hardly said a word. I 
wished he had gone 
away with the others 
so maybe he would 
be coming back to us 







The Long Shadow of Lincoln: A Litany
 

(We can succeed only by concert. . . . The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves. . . . December 1, 1862. The President's Message to Congress.)
Be sad, be cool, be kind,
remembering those now dreamdust
hallowed in the ruts and gullies,
solemn bones under the smooth blue sea,
faces warblown in a falling rain.

Be a brother, if so can be,
to those beyond battle fatigue
each in his own corner of earth
      or forty fathoms undersea
      beyond all boom of guns,
      beyond any bong of a great bell,
      each with a bosom and number,
      each with a pack of secrets,
each with a personal dream and doorway
and over them now the long endless winds
      with the low healing song of time,
      the hush and sleep murmur of time.

Make your wit a guard and cover.
Sing low, sing high, sing wide.
Let your laughter come free
remembering looking toward peace:
"We must disenthrall ourselves.

Be a brother, if so can be,
to those thrown forward
for taking hardwon lines,
for holding hardwon points
      and their reward so-so,
little they care to talk about,
their pay held in a mute calm,
highspot memories going unspoken,
what they did being past words,
what they took being hardwon.
      Be sad, be kind, be cool.
          Weep if you must
      And weep open and shameless
          before these altars.

There are wounds past words.
There are cripples less broken
than many who walk whole.
      There are dead youths
      with wrists of silence
      who keep a vast music
      under their shut lips,
what they did being past words,
their dreams like their deaths
beyond any smooth and easy telling,
having given till no more to give.

      There is dust alive
with dreams of The Republic,
with dreams of the Family of Man
flung wide on a shrinking globe
      with old timetables,
      old maps, old guide-posts
      torn into shreds,
      shot into tatters
      burnt in a firewind,
      lost in the shambles,
      faded in rubble and ashes.

      There is dust alive.
Out of a granite tomb,
Out of a bronze sarcophagus,
Loose from the stone and copper
Steps a whitesmoke ghost
Lifting an authoritative hand
In the name of dreams worth dying for,
In the name of men whose dust breathes
      of those dreams so worth dying for,
what they did being past words,
beyond all smooth and easy telling.

Be sad, be kind, be cool,
remembering, under God, a dreamdust
hallowed in the ruts and gullies,
solemn bones under the smooth blue sea,
faces warblown in a falling rain.

Sing low, sing high, sing wide.
Make your wit a guard and cover.
Let your laughter come free
like a help and a brace of comfort.

      The earth laughs, the sun laughs
over every wise harvest of man,
over man looking toward peace
by the light of the hard old teaching:
      "We must disenthrall ourselves.





Some San Francisco Poems: Sections 1-4

Moving over the hills, crossing the irrigation
canals perfect and profuse in the mountains the
streams of women and men walking under the high-
tension wires over the brown hills

                  in the multiple world of the fly's
multiple eye the songs they go to hear on
this occasion are no one's own

Needle's eye       needle eye       but in the ravine
again and again on the massive spike the song
clangs

as the tremendous volume of the music takes
over obscured by their long hair they seem
to be mourning

A MORALITY PLAY: PREFACE

Lying full length
On the bed in the white room

Turns her eyes to me

Again,

Naked . .

Never to forget her naked eyes

Beautiful and brave
Her naked eyes

Turn inward

Feminine light

The unimagined
Feminine light

Feminine ardor

Pierced and touched

Tho all say
Huddled among each other

Love'

The play begins with the world

A city street
Leads to the bay

Tamalpais in cloud

Mist over farmlands

Local knowledge
In the heavy hills

The great loose waves move landward
Heavysided in the wind

Grass and trees bent
Along the length of coast in the continual wind

The ocean pounds in her mind
Not the harbor leading inward
To the back bay and the slow river
Recalling flimsy Western ranches
The beautiful hills shine outward

Sunrise           the raw fierce fire
Coming up past the sharp edge

And the hoof marks on the mountain

Shines in the white room

Provincial city
Not alien enough

To naked eyes

This city died young

You too will be shown this

You will see the young couples

Leaving again in rags

So with artists.    How pleasurable
to imagine that, if only they gave
up their art, the children would be
healed,       would live.

                                 Irving Younger in The Nation

AND THEIR WINTER AND NIGHT IN DISGUISE'

The sea and a crescent strip of beach
Show between the service station and a deserted shack

A creek drains thru the beach
Forming a ditch
There is a discarded super-market cart in the ditch
That beach is the edge of a nation

There is something like shouting along the highway
A California shouting
On the long fast highway over the California mountains

Point Pedro
Its distant life

It is impossible the world should be either good or bad
If its colors are beautiful or if they are not beautiful
If parts of it taste good or if no parts of it taste good
It is as remarkable in one case as the other
                                                              As against this

We have suffered fear, we know something of fear
And of humiliation mounting to horror

The world above the edge of the foxhole belongs to the
              flying bullets, leaden superbeings
For the men grovelling in the foxhole danger, danger in
              being drawn to them

These little dumps
The poem is about them

Our hearts are twisted
In dead men's pride

Dead men crowd us
Lean over us

In the emplacements

The skull spins
Empty of subject

The hollow ego

Flinching from the war's huge air

Tho we are delivery boys and bartenders

We will choke on each other

Minds may crack

But not for what is discovered

Unless that everyone knew
And kept silent

Our minds are split
To seek the danger out

From among the miserable soldiers

ANNIVERSARY POEM

                    the picturesque
common lot' the unwarranted light

Where everyone has been

The very ground of the path
And the litter grow ancient

A shovel's scratched edge
So like any other man's

We are troubled by incredulity
We are troubled by scratched things

Becoming familiar
Becoming extreme

Let grief
Be
So it be ours

Nor hide one's eyes
As tides drop along the beaches in the thin wash of
                   breakers

And so desert each other

--lest there be nothing
 
                  The Indian girl walking across the desert, the
sunfish under the boat

How shall we say how this happened, these stories, our
                   stories

Scope, mere size, a kind of redemption

Exposed still and jagged on the San Francisco hills

Time and depth before us, paradise of the real, we
                  know what it is

To find now depth, not time, since we cannot, but depth

To come out safe,        to end well

We have begun to say good bye
To each other
And cannot say it





The Wife of Mission Rock
 

Nothing curves at sea,
and the men there die abruptly,
in imitation of the fact, except
when the ship rises higher than necessary
and then they must drop suddenly
but for a long time,
so that their deaths appear natural
in the end, and the women sweeping the coutyards
pause, thinking the dust
to be the cause of a specific dryness
in the mouth. They leave half of a
pastry to harden on a plate.
They leave all of the lemons and figs
in bowls. They leave fuschia
splattered on the stone steps leading
down to the bay. They carry their brooms
with them, keep sweeping the air,
cleaning it back to the sea.
They sweep the sand from the shore,
feet standing in neat little rows of foam.
Each at the edge of something when
the foghorns remind them:
they will not clearly remember it,
they will not altogether forget it.
They will wait for something to emerge,
like a man at sea carving his children
from soap. One woman will start the rumor
that the sea is deeper than necessary:
Tell her, when has anyone ever come back
for one day's effort on earth?





Keeping It Simple
 

I take the bird on the woodpile,
separate it from its function, feather
by feather. I blow up its scale.
I make a whole life out of it:
everywhere I am, its sense of loitering
lights on my shoulder.





Mathew Brady Arranging the Bodies
 

On a mountain flat with snow
a blue cloud
paints a last touch of life.
There's endless harm in trying
a dead body on for size.
The gentleman stands out
in every detail, except color.
He considers his life of a madness
that breaks unexpected
(one boy had a sweetheart
he wore her hair round his finger
it kept it from falling off
with the rest)
or comes also if he composes it
(lift one eye shut, put
rifle butt in the slack jaw
of soldiers decomposing).
He fell in love like a woman
in the folded arms
of a drying sweater:
touched one shoulder 
and a whole platoon
was affixed with smiles.
Teeth already loose
falling from their envelopes
thick folded letters
in a dead white mist.






Grandmothers Land
 

around the house stood an
orchard of plum, apple and pear
a blackwalnut tree, one white pine,
groves of white oak and willow clumps
the home of Jessie was largely redwood

blood, flesh and bone sprouted
inside her womb of redwood
for five generations
the trees now stand unpruned and wild

after relocating so many years before the War
the seeds of Jessie have returned

afternoon sunlight on the field
breezes moving grass and leaves
memories with family names wait
within the earth, the mountains,
the valley, the field, the trees





The Voice
 

"first there is a wordthe word is the song
1

song gives birth to
the song and dance
as the dance steps
the story speaks


2

the icy mountain water
that pierces the deep thirst
drums my fire
drums my medicine pouch


3

deep within my blood
a feather in the sky
foam on clear water
Tayko-mol!


4

free as the bear
and tall as redwoods
throb my blood roots
when spirits ride high


5

a valley ripe with acorns
and yellow poppies everywhere
as i stand here
dreaming of you


6

jolting my dream
an old man struggling
with an eel      his coat appears
disheveled and empty


7

in a sacred manner
i sang and waited
       a lick of your blood
       i must take, reverently, deer


8

for you, blue corn baby,
my thoughts
on a melody of love
sail the sky


9

around fire on my head
a rattlesnake hisses and slithers
then flies up      out of sight
fighting in sleep i cry out


10

the snake in my spine is tensing
for combat
thoughts become forced and tight
the air is a sharp knife


11

from under me today
the earth was pulled
balancing on a sharp mountain ridge
i search for a plain


12

Tayko-mol has not left us
but lives in the pulse
of our words, and waits
in the azure for us all





from My Emily Dickinson
 

          
               When I love a thing I want it and I try to get it. Abstraction of the particular from the universal is the entrance into evil. Love, a binding force, is both envy and emulation. HE (the Puritan God) is a realm of mystery and will always remain unknowable, authoritarian, unpredictable. Between revealed will and secret will Love has been torn in two.     DUALISM: Pythagoras said that all things were divisible into two genera,     good and evil; in the genus of good things he classified all perfect things     such as light, males, repose, and so forth, whereas in the genus of evil     he classified darkness, females, and so forth.                              (Thomas Aquinas, "On the Power of God, p. 84)     Promethean aspiration: To be a woman and a Pythagorean. What is the communalvision of poetry if you are curved, odd, indefinite, irregular, feminine. I go in disguise. Soul under stress, thread of connection broken, fusion of love and knowledge broken, visionary energy lost, Dickinson means this to be an ugly verse. First I find myself a Slave, next I understand my slavery, finally I re-discover myself at liberty inside the confines of known necessity. Gun goes on thinking ofthe violence done to meaning. Gun watches herself watching.
        




A Girl
 

A Girl,
      Her soul a deep-wave pearl
 Dim, lucent of all lovely mysteries;
      A face flowered for heart's ease,
      A brow's grace soft as seas
      Seen through faint forest-trees:
      A mouth, the lips apart,
 Like aspen-leaflets trembling in the breeze
     From her tempestuous heart.
     Such: and our souls so knit,
     I leave a page half-writ --
            The work begun
 Will be to heaven's conception done,
            If she come to it.





XXI 
 

  ,   
 
Ye rosy-armed, pure Graces, come, 
    Daughters of Zeus, be near! 
Oh, wherefore have my lips been dumb 
    So long in silence drear?

And why have I so cheerless been,
    So sorrowful and wild? 
It was because ye were not seen,
    Because ye had not smiled.

Although his prayer the Muses bless,
    The poet doth require
That ye, in frolic gentleness,
    Should stand beside his lyre.

Ne'er will he mortal ear delight, 
     Nor care-vex'd spirit ease;
Except he sing with ye in sight, 
    Rose-flushed among the trees.





A Summer Wind
 

O wind, thou hast thy kingdom in the trees, 
        And all thy royalties 
        Sweep through the land to-day. 
              It is mid June, 
And thou, with all thy instruments in tune,
              Thine orchestra
Of heaving fields and heavy swinging fir, 
              Strikest a lay 
              That doth rehearse 
Her ancient freedom to the universe. 
        All other sound in awe 
              Repeats its law: 
        The bird is mute; the sea 
        Sucks up its waves; from rain 
        The burthened clouds refrain, 
To listen to thee in thy leafery, 
              Thou unconfined, 
Lavish, large, soothing, refluent summer wind. 






Beloved
 

Mortal, if thou art beloved 
Life's offences are removed; 
All the fateful things that checked thee, 
Hearten, hallow, and protect thee. 
Grow'st thou mellow? What is age? 
Tinct on life's illumined page, 
Where the purple letters glow 
Deeper, painted long ago. 
What is sorrow? Comfort's prime, 
Love's choice Indian summer clime. 
Sickness!--thou wilt pray it worse 
For so blessed, balmy nurse. 
And for death! when thou art dying 
'Twill be Love beside thee lying. 
Death is lonesome? Oh, how brave 
Shows the foot-frequented grave! 
Heaven itself is but the casket 
For Love's treasure, ere he ask it,-- 
Ere with burning heart he follow, 
Piercing through corruption's hollow. 
If thou art beloved, oh then 
Fear no grief from mortal men.






XXXVI
 

Yea, gold is son of Zeus: no rust 
    Its timeless light can stain; 
The worm that brings man's flesh to dust 
    Assaults its strength in vain: 
More gold than gold the love I sing,
A hard, inviolable thing.

Men say the passions should grow old 
     With waning years; my heart 
Is incorruptible as gold, 
     'Tis my immortal part: 
Nor is there any god can lay
On love the finger of decay.





Lines For An Epic (Pagano, the Arc of Night Fallen ....)
 

Pagano, the arc of night fallen

On the Birthday of Ted Berrigan, (1965)
 

           "Sooner or later we'll all get to speak like Ted Berrigan

2 Poems
 

for Gerard Malanga and Andy Warhol

                 First Day On The Job


Shepherd him milk & sugar
12 o'clock among unicorns
time of blue veils
mummified Gramercy
My impressario message eaten up
ache in my crotch
I arrive at The Friends   I am sailing by way
of the sky

bus September boat with vacant windows
thank-you I am weak
O friendly tamarack
                     I'm coming with my little chair
insignificant when you manhandle God

End of my Poem

my coat a lalop girl on a dead rock
something in the air with telephones
the twin end of the day
like an atlantic squall
I can't always voice
my lyricide





                       Last Day On The Job


Forget us: alpine flowers deer
I wasn't to last for long
Forget us beards escorted by dogs
coming out of the white portals for exercise
Send her back to California with his eyes
says the kind old Good Humor Man
Send YOU to Robespire's Thermidor
where your last day of fire a mountain
of children that come up to you & say
I don't remember meeting you Goodbye
fatal hour matrons Third Avenue
And unseen indescriminant princesses who shatter
wine bottles on the lumespento traffic lights
Catshit cloud overhead while you're king
of pencil-sharpeners!

With their tongues hanging out in the heat

This Hermaphrodite   running up and down the stairs with
a sword   Hey!
The doors slam open  the crowds emerge
Like an age ashamed of itself
Like an elephant with a  caulifflower ear      Some are doing

           A St. Vitus dance and shooting fireworks
out of cactus-launchers


You come toward me like a diffident haystack
I'm talking to you all the time you pretend not to hear me
You're with your two pals   (One of them the "returned of the Boogey Woogies)   the road parts us   like a part in the hair
of the whole Earth   and splits me with it
The stars make a sound like a tuning-folk

Once Again, I've Missed Lamb-Chop's "Play-Along
 

for Shari Lewis (1934-1998)
Once again, I've missed Lamb Chop's Play-Along
Which, as it is, isn't
broadcast in Papiamento, myself being the Centurion
of the English where I am

Aha! The Brook, Cherith running by here meaning
the while I can "compare notes with Elijah
(Without a Jezebel to spook him!)
Although admittedly
in the movie Betty Davis is a winnter, ever quite
without a struggle
           Especially in the Waltz sequence

Which continues to reverberate in my head. So that I ask

"Is it, I, then, that am "The Revenant?

This McTalk
with its "scrolling windows
can never answer. But just now, could use

A bit of that compote of "stewed pears

          With cinnamon

The discalced
                    Carmelite Sisters
fed San Juan De La Cruz
thus, nursing and resusciating him back 
                                           to "health
Which is, in itself, at best
         --a provisional state!

Other than that,
          "IT's the most
Wonderful Time Of The Year! "So goes
the theme song Andy Williams 'Seasons' Greetings
TV Special, which makes me exceedingly
nostalgic for I know not what

Not too "christmasy for the
Chechnians at the moment. I know

"People are looking
for the excitement of the Moulin Rouge
                     Or a "Go-at
         the Slopes!

**-But   just a sighting

                      Of your red

There ever could be enough in that.

                     "golden lamps hanging in

September Notebook: Stories
 

Everyone comes here from a long way off
(is a line from a poem I read last night).


                             *     *     *

Driving up 80 in the haze, they talked and talked.
(Smoke in the air shimmering from wildfires.)
His story was sad and hers was roiled, troubled.


                            *     *     *

Alternatively:

A man and a woman, old friends, are in a theater
watching a movie in which a man and a woman,
old friends, are driving through summer on a mountain road.
The woman is describing the end of her marriage
and sobbing, shaking her head and laughing
and sobbing. The man is watching the road, listening,
his own more diffuse unhappiness in abeyance,
and because, in the restaurant before the film
the woman had been describing the end of her marriage
and cried, they are not sure whether they are in the theater
or on the mountain road, and when the timber truck
comes suddenly around the bend, they both flinch.


                            *     *     *

He found that it was no good trying to tell
what happened that day. Everything he said
seemed fictional the moment that he said it,
the rain, the scent of her hair, what she said
as she was leaving, and why it was important
for him to explain that the car had been parked
under eucalyptus on a hillside, and how velvety
and blurred the trees looked through the windshield;
not, he said, that making fictions might not be
the best way of getting at it, but that nothing he said
had the brute, abject, unassimilated quality
of a wounding experience: the ego in any telling
was already seeing itself as a character, and a character,
he said, was exactly what he was not at that moment,
even as he kept wanting to explain to someone,
to whomever would listen, that she had closed the door
so quietly and so firmly that the beads of rain
on the side window didn't even quiver.


                            *     *     *

Names for involuntary movements of the body--
squirm, wince, flinch, and shudder--
sound like a law firm in Dickens:
"Mr. Flinch took off his black gloves
as if he were skinning his hands.
"Quiver dipped the nib of his pen
into the throat of the inkwell.


                            *     *     *

The receptionist at the hospital morgue told him
to call the city medical examiner's office,
but you only got a recorded voice on weekends.

Setup without the punchline:

Three greenhorns are being measured for suits
by a very large tailor on Hester Street.

                            *     *     *

Once there were two sisters called Knock Me and Sock Me;
their best friend was a bear named Always Arguing.
What kind of animals were the sisters? one child asked.
Maybe they could be raccoons, said the other.
Or pandas, said the first. They could be pandas.

                            *     *     *

"Why? he asked. "Because she was lonely,
and angry, said the friend
who knew her better,
"and she'd run out of stories.
Or come to the one story.

It is good to sit down to birthday cake
with children, who think it is the entire point
of life and who, therefore, respect each detail
of the ceremony. There ought to be a rule,
he thought, for who gets to lick the knife
that cuts the cake and the rule should have
its pattern somewhere in the winter stars.
Which do you add to the tea first, he'd asked,
the sugar or the milk? And the child had said,
instantly: "The milk. (Laws as cool
and angular as words: angular, sidereal.)

Stories about the distribution of wealth:
Once upon a time there was an old man
and an old women who were very, very poor.

How Eldie Got Her Name

The neighborhood had been so dangerous,
she said, there was one summer when the mailmen
refused to deliver the mail. Her mother
never appeared and her grandmother,
who had bought a handgun for protection
and had also taught her how to use it,
would walk her to the post office for the sweet,
singsong, half-rhymed letters that smelled,
or that she imagined smelled, of Florida.
She had, when she was ten, shot at an intruder
climbing in the window. The roar,
she said, was tremendous and she doesn't know
to this day whether she hit the man or not.
(A big-boned young woman, skin the color
of the inside of some light-colored hazelnut
confection, auburn eyes, some plucked string
of melancholy radiating from her whole body
when she spoke.) Did her mama come back?
They had asked. She never came back.
The mail started up again but the letters stopped.
Turned out she was good in school, and that
was what saved her. She loved the labor
of schoolwork. Loved finishing a project
and contemplating the neatness of her script.
Her grandmother shook her head, sometimes,
amused and proud, and called her "Little Diligence.

A Ballad:

He loved to watch that woman sew.
She let her hair grow long for show.

She looked beautiful, and looked her age, too.
She'd had a go at putting herself together;
she had always had the confidence that,
with a face like hers, a few touches
to represent the idea of a put-together look
would do, like some set designer's genius
minimalism. It had a slightly harridan effect
and he remembered that it wasn't what was
headlong or slapdash about her, but the way
they gestured, like a quotation, at an understanding
of elegance it would have been boring to spell out,
that had at first dazzled him about her.
He felt himself stirring at this recognition,
and at a certain memory that attended it,
and then laughed at the thought that he had
actually stimulated himself with an analysis
of her style, and she said, as if she were remembering
the way he could make her insecure, "What?
What are you smiling about? and he said, "Nothing.
And she said, "Oh, yes. Right. I remember nothing.

In the other world the girls were named Eleanor and Filina,
and one night it was very warm and they could not sleep
for the heat and the stillness, and they went outside,
beyond the wall of their parents' garden and into a meadow.
It was a dark night, moonless, and the stars were so thick
they seemed to shudder, and the sisters stood a long time
in the sweet smell of the cooling grasses, looking at the sky
and listening in the silence. After a while they heard a stirring
and saw that a pair of bright eyes was watching them
from the woods' edge. "Maybe it's their friend, the bear,
one of the children said. "I don't like this story, said the other.






Carolina
 

Nonentity's birthplace: a front yard sweeps
its dirt clean. Devil hopped up the oak tree,
devil-take-the-profit seized  
a jay in the twigs by the feet, wings buffeting

this child's cheeks to rhyme. Leaf of gift
box tissue folded over her pocket comb. Hind
pocket kazoo. Won't somebody please start
something other & oddball soon,  

narrow her down out of folly  
& trivia to destiny? But Whynot the tortie cat 
flopped an irregular sunny patch, 
wriggles & rolls & revives the blissy fits of ignorance.

Decades crunch as minor upcountry thunder. My nod 
to Mastermind's robot rabbit, said to dwell in his top 
hat, who tips me a silk evening. Gloaming again & never
far from home. Listen you hoots: alas for me, for my love 

with the gallant and grifter soul has tucked 
into just the crevice he feared. Fear told  
& tells him the truth, so he trusts it. Listen
you hollers, whatever you had in mind for me. 






Whereabouts
 

Glove box rummages itself & dumps: fuzzy cough 
droppings & stuck (menthol) among them a misdirectional 
map intrigues me: say clotheslines'
fripperies hopping the breeze off the alley & garbage 
lids clanging downhill to the sea: say there
in the sea floes
of penguins bobbing up to Argentine flamingos.

How hard is it to get lost? Listen to lost
useless horses whingeing for home & hames, a lost
grail stuffed with dirt deaf to human legends long 
unstrung of sacred tune & lost, 
children prodded along in the loops of war,
hopscotch mistake, the cast stone
skipped off the lake instead & lost the tournament

to the nice policeman there with the ice cream
precinct & his body buddy Dad. Dad declares he knows
by the spit & stripe of her this's no one of his own, 
his kids mope, & he goes. Ear to ear I must 
look lucky at last, librarian
at the dictionary of things looking-up ever since
I hid in the glove box, pretending to be directions.






What Time It Gets To Be
 

I was just getting to that.
But first, old age.
If you could just let me finish.

Once it was I who rudely
interrupted proceedings: the chair rapped
& called to order, but I seized from pending

approval the minutes & ran 
off with the handsome mustachioed 
night watch. Matching wits we wound up
jangling on a motel
bureau in simultaneous 
alarm & ran down 
together to silence,

Bide-a-Wee's appointed
guest in his sleep deceased
so far from home he didn't know
a soul. A what? We heard  
Gideons rustling in the drawer,

& as we rifled the fellow's bags before we fled, 
& fled, his time flew too,
from his cuffs & collars flapping ahead.






A Bowl of Fruit
 

When I think of that room
I see the de Kooning at the end of the hall

Sometimes rain on the long windows
Or the tinkering of drops on the skylight

But not Yvon
Splashing Scotch into a cocktail glass

Otherwise fastidious--

In retrospect
I should have asked her more

About the famous jazz guitarist
She had been engaged to

But that much was true--

Even after she bought me a pocket knife
Sheathed in velvet 

Every young man needs a knife
She informed her group

But in the restaurant her friends
Eyed me like a turnip. One that talked--

While she was away at her office, 
I tried to read

Her unfinished essay
On the vagaries of diplomacy

Reclining 
On a rug of embroidered storks

The two small Rodins
Seemed misplaced

A grand piano
She didn't play

(though I did, affecting a controlled
passion

while gazing over rooftops
at carefully maintained gardens)--

I don't remember her smell

I don't recall her fingers

The last I heard she was living in Barcelona

She never did learn to cook

Now her letters are worth money






Impromptu
 

First there was Jim, clamping to my long black hair
             that nine-pound Cleopatra wig 
             with nylon bands and bobbie pins.

Meanwhile I was on fire for Chad, who coached me
             a bit impatiently Tuesday nights
             on my Joan-of-Arc inflection.

Then Terence said I'd be perfect for the lounge-singer-
             turned-whore, and as it turned out
             that was a fairly easy gig.

Max signed me on soon after, claiming I was a natural
             for Eternally Aggrieved Girl,
             which in hindsight hurts me deeply.

So by the time you followed me back to the green room
             to wait in the hallway--whistling!--
             for my scrubbed face to emerge,

naturally I was wary, waiting for the script 
             you never bothered to come up with.
             It was damned awkward sitting there,

nothing but milkshakes between us. Maybe, I thought, 
             you'd assumed I was the one with a script.  
             Finally I decided to give Terence a call.

I didn't like the way you looked at me so steadily
             with your chin resting on one fist,
             as if the table were a table, the boards

A floor. Listening there as if you meant it, 
             as if something I could say were true, and every
             moment from now on would be my cue.






Night Drive
 

Roadlight licks the night ahead, licks
the white line on night's new hide, licks
the undulating blacktop flat, sticks its end-
less forking tongue out onward, flicks
itself at culvert, tree, passing truck, a sign
insisting heartbeats equal conscious life
(it may be) of someone's (maybe my) 
forever unborn child. I let the knife
of wind inside and sing A Whiter Shade of Pale,
no earthly reason why, and think of what
won't be and who, and whether it be
speed, wind, song, or my mind's roar
that drowns for once time's slangy whine,
here comes hope to climb clear of before;
stillborn hope with desperate, Moro-reflex, 
undead grip climbs right back up my neck, 
raising each pointless, residual nape hair 
in ancestral salute to an absence, to the air
that won't question itself, won't ever check
the moral rearview. I accelerate gamely,
wondering what makes me want to leave
each person, place and thing I learn to love.
What shoves me off again, racing insanely,
as if to the place that will always save
a place for me, a room that will contain
the kind of people who'd embrace the things 
I'm still afraid I'm still afraid to face.  






The Crossroads
 

This is the place it happened. It was here.
You might not know it was unless you knew.
All day the cars blow past and disappear.
This is the place it happened. It was here.
Look at the sparkling dust, the oily smear.
Look at the highway marker, still askew.
This is the place it happened. It was here.
You might not know it was unless you knew.






The Hill
 

On the crowded hill bordering the mill,
across the shallow stream, nearer than they seem,
they wait and will be waiting.

Rain. The small smilax is the same to the fly
as the big bush of lilacs exploding nearby.
The rain may be abating.

On the quiet hill beside the droning mill,
across the dirty stream, nearer than they seem,
they wait and will be waiting.

The glass-eyed cicada drones in the linden draped like a tent
above three polished stones. Aphids swarm at the scent
of the yellow petals.

A bird comes to prod a clump of wet fur.
The ferns idiotically nod when she takes it away with her.
Something somewhere settles.

On the crowded hill bordering the mill
is our best cemetery, pretty, but not very.
All are welcome here.

Sun finds a bare teak box on the tidy green plot.
It finds lichen-crusted blocks fringed with forget-me-not.
Angels preen everywhere.

On the crowded hill bordering the mill
is our best cemetery, pretty, but not very. 
All are welcome here.





Here
 

Nothing has changed. They have a welcome sign,
a hill with cows and a white house on top,
a mall and grocery store where people shop,
a diner where some people go to dine.
It is the same no matter where you go,
and downtown you will find no big surprises.
Each fall the dew point falls until it rises.
White snow, green buds, green lawn, red leaves, white snow.

This is all right. This is their hope. And yet, 
though what you see is never what you get,
it does feel somehow changed from what it was.
Is it the people? Houses? Fields? The weather?
Is it the streets? Is it these things together?
Nothing here ever changes, till it does.






On Cooking a Symbol at 400 Degrees
 

I butterflied Australian rack of lamb
with shallots, garlic, parsley, butter, wine
(some in the pan, some for the palate).
Although the livestock loved in nursery rhyme
avoided clumps of mint, it served my family
nonetheless. I am no PETA zealot
(leather jacket, handbag, wallet, shoes)
but wonder if the deeds we do pursue
us in the afterlife. Does the fleecy
creature have a tenderable claim?
My lambent mind considers our short lease
on life, the oven hot. Am I to blame?
Who gave thee such a tender voice? asked Blake.
Myself am Hell. I watch the mutton bake.





Ravens Hiding in a Shoe
 

There is something men and women living in houses
Don't understand. The old alchemists standing
Near their stoves hinted at it a thousand times.

Ravens at night hide in an old woman's shoe.
A four-year-old speaks some ancient language.
We have lived our own death a thousand times.

Each sentence we speak to friends means the opposite
As well. Each time we say, "I trust in God, it means
God has already abandoned us a thousand times.

Mothers again and again have knelt in church
In wartime asking God to protect their sons,
And their prayers were refused a thousand times.

The baby loon follows the mother's sleek
Body for months. By the end of summer, she
Has dipped her head into Rainy Lake a thousand times.

Robert, you've wasted so much of your life
Sitting indoors to write poems. Would you
Do that again? I would, a thousand times.






Living at the End of Time
 

There is so much sweetness in children's voices,
And so much discontent at the end of day,
And so much satisfaction when a train goes by.

I don't know why the rooster keeps crying,
Nor why elephants keep raising their trunks,
Nor why Hawthorne kept hearing trains at night.

A handsome child is a gift from God,
And a friend is a vein in the back of the hand,
And a wound is an inheritance from the wind.

Some say we are living at the end of time,
But I believe a thousand pagan ministers
Will arrive tomorrow to baptize the wind.

There's nothing we need to do about John. The Baptist
Has been laying his hands on earth for so long
That the well water is sweet for a hundred miles.

It's all right if we don't know what the rooster
Is saying in the middle of the night, nor why we feel
So much satisfaction when a train goes by.






Tourist
 

Warsaw, October: rose-madder by four,
the soldierly grey boulevards slippery

with tickets to winter. After forty years rebuilding,
the Old Town is like this beautiful girl I knew

whose face was wheel-broken in a crash,
and remade so well it was hard to say how

she looked wrong. I'd brought two questions here--
holding them as if they might slip: who were

my mother's people? Where did they die?
In an attic-archive--deep card indexes, ink turned lilac

with age--I handed my questions to a love-laborer
in a yarmulke; with sad palms and a shake

of the head he regretted that any answers now
lay probably beyond our reach. So

I abandoned questing and went back to tourism;
joined the passeggiata, drank black tea, got stickied

under sooty lime trees, saw boisterous children,
all knees and elbows, skyline-capering

on the wall at the river-divide. Beyond
their frail silhouettes against the petrol dusk

huge cranes were moving, courtly, confident,
building another new Warsaw across the Vistula.







Digging
 

Missionary girl reports that Chinese addicts say
your heart begs you to stay away

even while your legs are carrying you back.
After the merry little jitter of the filter

and the smack dancing in the spoon, after
the absorbed, childlike, assassin-like procedure--

citric, water, flame--I'm back in the basement,
heartsick, digging for a vein in February

as in a February gone and a February 
still to come, spitting prayers through the tourniquet

between my teeth, licking up tears and pleading
for my blood to plume up in the barrel, please

blossom up, squid-ink, blood-anemone 
in the works--though you can have all that and miss,

or pull out and find you'd had a vein, now "pissing 
blood--Deano's words as his gray fringe smeared across

his forehead, as he missed and bled and raged 
to get it IN. Blood: thank Christ. Spit out

the tie, inject the welling gratitude
that flushes pleasure through the grief--

for the help and hope of friends
sold out, for all her loving years--

all of it driven down before one flood,
one gut-bracing stealth of warmth. Ah

well: restorative as sunshine to a snake.
So around the days and seasons 

the junkies go--you might as well accelerate
us till our days and nights are strobing by--

use, cluck, raise, score, use, cluck, raise--
lantern-show flicker of tail-chasing, nameless days

spent waiting, cheating, waiting, struggling to outrun
the burn-and-freeze and--maybe worse--

the waking up to all that's lost: her happiness,
her younger years, the child she might have had.






In the Loop
 

I heard from people after the shootings. People 
I knew well or barely or not at all. Largely 
the same message: how horrible it was, how little 
there was to say about how horrible it was. 
People wrote, called, mostly e-mailed 
because they know I teach at Virginia Tech,
to say, there's nothing to say. Eventually 
I answered these messages: there's nothing 
to say back except of course there's nothing 
to say, thank you for your willingness 
to say it. Because this was about nothing. 
A boy who felt that he was nothing, 
who erased and entered that erasure, and guns 
that are good for nothing, and talk of guns 
that is good for nothing, and spring 
that is good for flowers, and Jesus for some, 
and scotch for others, and "and for me 
in this poem, "and that is good 
for sewing the minutes together, which otherwise 
go about going away, bereft of us and us 
of them. Like a scarf left on a train and nothing 
like a scarf left on a train. As if the train, 
empty of everything but a scarf, still opens 
its doors at every stop, because this 
is what a train does, this is what a man does 
with his hand on a lever, because otherwise, 
why the lever, why the hand, and then it was over, 
and then it had just begun.





Pupil
 

How is it that you hold such influence over me:
your practiced slouch, your porkpie hat at rakish angle,
commending the dumpling-shaped lump atop your pelvis--
as if we've one more thing to consider amidst 
the striptease of all your stanzas and all your lines--
draws me down into the center of you: the prize peony,
so that I'm nothing more than an ant whose singular labor
is to gather the beading liquid inside you; bring it to light.

I have never written a true poem, it seems. Snatches
of my salacious dreams, sandwiched together all afternoon 
at my desk, awaiting the dark visitation of The Word.
When you arrive, unfasten your notebook, and recite,
I am only a schoolboy with a schoolboy's hard mind.
You are the headmaster. Now you must master me.






The Fluffer Talks of Eternity
 

I can only give you back what you imagine.
I am a soulless man. When I take you 
into my mouth, it is not my mouth. It is
an unlit pit, an aperture opened just enough
in the pinhole camera to capture the shade.

I have caused you to rise up to me, and I
have watched as you rose and waned.
Our times together have been innumerable. Still,
like a Capistrano swallow, you come back.
You understand: I understand you. Understand
each jiggle and tug. Your pudgy, mercurial wad.

I am simply a hand inexhaustible as yours 
could never be. You're nevertheless prepared to shoot.
If I could I'd finish you. Be more than just your rag.






Encounter in the Local Pub
 

Unlike Francis Bacon, we no longer believe in the little patterns we make of the chaos of history.               --Overheard remark
As he looked up from his glass, its quickly melting ice,
into the bisected glowing demonic eyes of the goat,
he sensed that something fundamental had shifted,

or was done. As if, after a life of enchantment, he
had awakened, like Bottom, wearing the ears of an ass, 
and the only light was a lanthorn, an ersatz moon.

It was not that the calendar hadn't numbered the days
with an orbital accuracy, its calculations
exact, but like a man who wants to hang a hammock

in his yard, to let its bright net cradle him, but only
has one tree, so he--wild and aware of it--knew
he had lost the order he required, and with it, rest--

his thoughts only a sagging bundle of loose ends,
and the heart, a naked animal in search of a pelt, 
that once fell for every Large Meaning it could 

wrap itself in, as organs are packed in ice for transit
from one ending to the next, an afterlife of parts--and
the whole? Exorbitant claim--not less than all,

and oddly spelled; its ear rhyme is its opposite,
the great hole in the heart of things. The goat,
he noticed, had a rank smell, feral. Unnerved,

he looks away, watches the last of his ice 
as it melts, the way some godlike eye might see
the mighty glaciers in a slow dissolve back into sea.

He notes how incommensurate the simile, a last
attempt to dignify his shaking gaze, and reaches
for the bill; he's damned if the goat will pay. 






A Perfect Market
 

ou plutt les chanter
Recite your lines aloud, Ronsard advised,
Or, even better, sing them. Common speech
Held all the rhythmic measures that he prized
In poetry. He had much more to teach,
But first he taught that. Several poets paid
Him heed. The odd one even made the grade,
Building a pretty castle on the beach.

But on the whole it's useless to point out
That making the thing musical is part
Of pinning down what you are on about.
The voice leads to the craft, the craft to art:
All this is patent to the gifted few
Who know, before they can, what they must do
To make the mind a spokesman for the heart.

As for the million others, they are blessed:
This is their age. Their slapdash in demand
From all who would take fright were thought expressed
In ways that showed a hint of being planned,
They may say anything, in any way.
Why not? Why shouldn't they? Why wouldn't they?
Nothing to study, nothing to understand.

And yet it could be that their flight from rhyme
And reason is a technically precise
Response to the confusion of a time
When nothing, said once, merits hearing twice.
It isn't that their deafness fails to match
The chaos. It's the only thing they catch.
No form, no pattern. Just the rolling dice

Of idle talk. Always a blight before,
It finds a place today, fulfills a need:
As those who cannot write increase the store
Of verses fit for those who cannot read,
For those who can do both the field is clear
To meet and trade their wares, the only fear
That mutual benefit might look like greed.

It isn't, though. It's just the interchange
Of showpiece and attention that has been
There since the cavemen took pains to arrange
Pictures of deer and bison to be seen 
To best advantage in the flickering light.
Our luck is to sell tickets on the night
Only to those who might know what we mean,

And they are drawn to us by love of sound.
In the first instance, it is how we sing
That brings them in. No mystery more profound
Than how a melody soars from a string
Of syllables, and yet this much we know:
Ronsard was right to emphasize it so,
Even in his day. Now, it's everything:

The language falls apart before our eyes,
But what it once was echoes in our ears
As poetry, whose gathered force defies
Even the drift of our declining years.
A single lilting line, a single turn
Of phrase: these always proved, at last we learn,
Life cries for joy though it must end in tears.





ICU
 

For A.J. Verdelle
Those mornings I traveled north on I91,
passing below the basalt cliff of East Rock
where the elms discussed their genealogies.
I was a chaplain at Hartford Hospital,
took the Myers-Briggs with Sister Margaret,
learned I was an I drawn to Es.
In small group I said, "I do not like it--
the way so many young black men die here
unrecognized, their gurneys stripped,
their belongings catalogued and unclaimed.
On the neonatal ICU, newborns breathed,
blue, spider-delicate in a nest of tubes.
A Sunday of themselves, their tissue purpled,
their eyelids the film on old water in a well,
their faces resigned in their see-through attics,
their skin mottled mildewed wallpaper.
It is correct to love even at the wrong time.
On rounds, the newborns eyed me, each one 
like Orpheus in his dark hallway, saying:
I knew I would find you, I knew I would lose you. 






Margaret
 

          
          I remember she rented a room on the second floor from Jenny Holtzerman, an Austrian widow. The two women lived on Girard Avenue South, in Kenwood, an elegant suburb of Minneapolis. Any promise of husbands had disappeared long ago. From the kitchen I often remember the jelly smell of a linzer torte. I was in high school and often I eavesdropped. Once, quietly, she said to my mother, "I never knew the love of a man. She had mentioned having a husband, but during the war they were separated in the chaos of Budapest, and later she lost track of him. Once she showed me her room: the walls were bare with cracks. Her daybed was narrow, barely slept-in. Her room resembled hundreds of scant little rooms around the world, the way it accepted blue and purple-violet detail--on her bureau, no family photographs, instead, playbills autographed by cast members, a calendar tattered, crossed, marked, no jewelry, some coins. Her window sashes warped, her wires shorted and the paint around her doorframe kept chipping off--"like in The Cherry Orchard, she said, "by Chekhov. She told a joke in Hungarian to Hannah Tamasek and even I, not knowing a word, laughed. She bowed gently in a mannerism distinctly Viennese and spoke on occasion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She loved the Guthrie Theater, where curtains rose on miniature worlds, preferring memorized dialogue and costumes to something truer. Five feet tall in orthopedic shoes, she limped. Time has a way of rearranging things and I could have most details wrong now, but there was this: during the war, she met a man, whom she gave money to, she did not know the man well, but had trusted him to smuggle her father across the border, the man pocketed the money, bought chocolates for his mistress from Belgium, and placed Margaret's father on a train to Auschwitz. So it makes sense to me now that simple decisions baffled Margaret. It makes sense to me now that when news reached us of Primo Levi's suicide, Margaret did not blink. It makes sense to me now that when Dr. Sikorski spoke of fighting in the Warsaw sewers, Margaret said, "I do not believe in God. Those who saw what they saw grow fewer. Margaret has been dead a long time now. But perhaps you will understand why I chose her, why I have smudged the slow waltz of her smile and added only a few modest blue strokes--here and here. As you leave Margaret behind and turn the page, listen as the page falls back and your hand gently buries her. This is what the past sounds like.
        




Cloud
 

A blue stain
creeps across
the deep pile
of the evergreens.
From inside the
forest it seems
like an interior
matter, something
wholly to do
with trees, a color
passed from one
to another, a
requirement
to which they
submit unflinchingly 
like soldiers or 
brave people
getting older. 
Then the sun 
comes back and
it's totally over.






Reading Saint John of the Cross
 

How many miles to the border
where all the sky there is
exists for the soul alone?

Where the only breathers
breathing are constructed
from some new electricity
and the flowers are made
indestructible, and messages
from the dead arrive like calm
white birds with a gift?

One more night of spiritual
ice and we might all become
birds, green birds frozen 
on a black winter branch.

There is a drumming in the shadows
under leaves: a million eight-eyed
spiders on the march.

The buckeyes beat themselves 
half to death against 
some lit-from-within screen.







Three Addresses
 

1642 Argonne Place, NW
 Alley of giant air conditioners, you roared
 your ill wind our way day and night. We burned
 you down, little house, but you rose right up again.  
 We played guitars by candlelight and sang songs to the cat.
 We stole each other's cake and dope, dancing
 all night, sleeping late, driving down Columbia
 Road to the Omega for Mexican-style chicken,
 which two lovers could live on for an entire day.
 We threatened you 
 with a sledgehammer
 if you wouldn't let us go.  
 Enough, you finally stammered,
 be gone from Argonne!  
  
 1920 S St. NW: The Chateau Thierry
 If you opened the door without thinking,
 the entire neighborhood gushed into the apartment
 like an open hydrant.  We gathered around the black
 and white tv  like it was a tabernacle containing
 the secrets we yearned to know.  The first Gay Pride Day
 made the building tremble so violently the roaches
 scurried from the cracks and crevices looking
 for safer quarters.  Theodore, Edward, and Al
 ran the only manual elevator still going in our
 part of town. Casey, violent and crazy, dealt coke
 out of his first floor apartment.  Mara owned
 a dozen petite dogs to be avoided at all costs.
 Zoltan Farkas wrote The Baltimore Poems
 and disappeared completely from the landscape.
 I had a brass bed, my altar of love, and a cat
 named Spooky.  People yelled my name
 up the side of the building, I threw them
 a key out the window, and they rose
 up to the fifth floor and through that open door
 into my abode of bliss, which I still miss.
  
 3701 Massachusetts Ave. NW: Cathedral Court
 They told me I was moving to the geriatric district.
 No Metro up there, they warned.  But I was now
 on top of the hill, across the street from 
 one of God's most prestigious addresses.
 I would stare at the naked bodies carved above
 the Cathedral entrance, like a page torn from 
 the Playboy version of Genesis, thinking
 yes--this is the way religion should be.
 A bus took me back to Dupont Circle
 in three minutes.  At night I'd walk home
 up Mass Ave, past all the embassies,
 loving to touch down momentarily
 on Irish soil, salute the statue of Gibran,
 great poet of wedding-vow love, hail Mary and Tom
 and Cyn and Steve.  Pick up the mail. 
 Waltz with Susan in the enormous living room,
 then lie in bed at night, by the window,
 hypnotized by the big cake of a church bathed
 in its rosy blush of light, fireworks
 erupting somewhere in the city's distant dark.





Alone for a Week
 

I washed a load of clothes
and hung them out to dry.
Then I went up to town
and busied myself all day.
The sleeve of your best shirt
rose ceremonious
when I drove in; our night-
clothes twined and untwined in
a little gust of wind.

For me it was getting late;
for you, where you were, not.
The harvest moon was full
but sparse clouds made its light
not quite reliable.
The bed on your side seemed
as wide and flat as Kansas;
your pillow plump, cool,
and allegorical. . . .






No Steps
 

The young bull dropped his head and stared.
Only a wispy wire--electrified--kept us
apart. That, and two long rows of asparagus.
An ancient apple tree
blossomed prodigally pink and white.

The muddy path sucked at my shoe,
but I reached the granite step, and knocked
at the rickety porch door.
Deep in the house a dog began to bark.
I had prepared my Heart Fund speech,
and the first word--When--was on my tongue.

I heard no steps--only the breeze
riffling the tender poplar leaves,
and a random, meditative moo
behind me. . . . Relieved, I turned back
to the car, passing once more
under the bull's judicial eye. . . .
Everything was intact: the canister,
still far too light and mute,
and metal boutonnires where they began--
in a zip-lock plastic sandwich bag.






The Clearing
 

The dog and I push through the ring
of dripping junipers
to enter the open space high on the hill
where I let him off the leash.

He vaults, snuffling, between tufts of moss;
twigs snap beneath his weight; he rolls
and rubs his jowls on the aromatic earth;
his pink tongue lolls.

I look for sticks of proper heft
to throw for him, while he sits, prim
and earnest in his love, if it is love.

All night a soaking rain, and now the hill
exhales relief, and the fragrance
of warm earth. . . . The sedges
have grown an inch since yesterday,
and ferns unfurled, and even if they try
the lilacs by the barn can't
keep from opening today.

I longed for spring's thousand tender greens,
and the white-throated sparrow's call
that borders on rudeness. Do you know--
since you went away
all I can do
is wait for you to come back to me.





Heavy Summer Rain
 

The grasses in the field have toppled,
and in places it seems that a large, now
absent, animal must have passed the night.
The hay will right itself if the day

turns dry. I miss you steadily, painfully.
None of your blustering entrances
or exits, doors swinging wildly
on their hinges, or your huge unconscious
sighs when you read something sad,
like Henry Adams's letters from Japan,
where he traveled after Clover died.

Everything blooming bows down in the rain:
white irises, red peonies; and the poppies
with their black and secret centers
lie shattered on the lawn.





Thinking of Madame Bovary
 

The first hot April day the granite step
was warm. Flies droned in the grass.
When a car went past they rose
in unison, then dropped back down. . . .

I saw that a yellow crocus bud had pierced
a dead oak leaf, then opened wide. How strong
its appetite for the luxury of the sun!

Everyone longs for love's tense joy and red delights.

And then I spied an ant
dragging a ragged, disembodied wing
up the warm brick walk. It must have been
the Methodist in me that leaned forward,
preceded by my shadow, to put a twig just where
the ant was struggling with its own desire.





The Roll Call
 

Any half-decent rapper
Can conjure the dead,

Can reach into graves
And accuse God

Of Indian-giving.
The trick is ancestral,

No more magic than memory's
Hidden strings & chains.

Trust me,
We haven't forgotten a name.

Say them. Raise your hands.
Holler at me!





Sticks
 

My father was an enormous man
Who believed kindness and lack of size
Were nothing more than sissified
Signs of weakness. Narrow-minded,

His eyes were the worst kind
Of jury--deliberate, distant, hard.
No one could outshout him
Or make bigger fists. The few

Who tried got taken for bad,
Beat down, their bodies slammed.
I wanted to be just like him:
Big man, man of the house, king.

A plagiarist, hitting the things he hit,
I learned to use my hands watching him
Use his, pretending to slap mother
When he slapped mother.

He was sick. A diabetic slept
Like a silent vowel inside his well-built,
Muscular, dark body. Hard as all that 
With similar weaknesses

--I discovered writing,
How words are parts of speech
With beats and breaths of their own.
Interjections like flams. Wham! Bam!

An heir to the rhythm
And tension beneath the beatings,
My first attempts were filled with noise,
Wild solos, violent uncontrollable blows.

The page tightened like a drum
Resisting the clockwise twisting
Of a handheld chrome key,
The noisy banging and tuning of growth.





A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop
 

All those
    Liquid love affairs,
Blind swimmers
    Trusting rumps.
We wiggled,
     Imagining water.
Wet, where was
     The One?
Nevermind Atlantis
    And the promise
Of moving pictures,
    A lit candle
In the window
    Of our conscious minds.
Those who danced,
    Pretending to swim
Underwater,
    Did so out
Of pure allegiance. 
    Some wore snorkels
Made with 
    The waistbands
Of funky underwear,
    Others wet suits
With clothespins
    Clamped to their noses,
Airtight as
     Black Power handshakes.
Rump-by-rump,
     The strings attached
To our thangs were
     Reeled into The Deep
And rhythmic as fins,
     Schools of P signs
Flapped and waved
     Like flags.
One nation
     Under a groove.
No one held their breath
     In the flashlit depth.
No one sank.

Ode for Donny Hathaway
 

and then there are the one-hit zombies
cursed to an eternity of Monday nights

who runs our music does not make it
controls manufacture and marketing of rhythm
schemes on and fixes the charts. it's polyphonic
from the dark of the chitlin to solid gold dawn
doublecrossed over

a love come down

after the plunge
sloshing around in limbo

that too sweet gospel splash





February 11th 1990
 

                                          --for Dennis Brutus
This year the leaves turn red green black
freedom colors each leaf
each stitch of grass. I am amazed
at my sweet harvest. The prison door has opened
and a nation's heart is released. I am full
having spent my greediness in a ritual of joy.





Jean Rhys
 

I'm preparing myself for an extended period of loneliness
That will begin very soon I think
I've illegally downloaded two new depressing songs
I've placed a copy of Good Morning, Midnight under my pillow for easy reference
I've printed out the tablature for every Morrissey song I know so I can sing them to myself
Alone in my room
Just a few things are needed really
To make me calm
While I figure out a simple, clean, and effective way to kill myself,
With minimal stress for the person who has to find and dispose of my body
But I'll probably never think of a way
Because I'll probably never kill myself
I'll just lie in my bed suffocating myself with my pillows
While listening to the four songs you said were your favorite
And maybe burn myself a little with the iron
On special occasions
And the next time I'm in a subway station,
I'll stand a little further on the yellow line
Or maybe the next I'm at your apartment
I'll try a little harder





gigantic mountains
 

when aliens come to the earth

they will land on top of gigantic mountains

they will see the people everywhere

each alien will communicate telepathically with another alien

on the opposite side of the sphere

that is its clone and itself at the same time

like an atom in quantum physics

the same alien in two places at once

and this multiplied by millions

on top of gigantic mountains

'the strategy is to destroy humans'

each alien will tell itself and its clone

humans will understand this strategy once

the killing started, immediately happening

in two places on opposite ends of the world at

once, an alien and itself

murdering two humans by looking at their faces

then that happening repeatedly or something

for some amount of time

the humans falling over and their faces hitting the pavement

or the carpet, or the grass

or the side of a coffee table

on some dog shit

*

there will be resistance

soldiers on all parts of the earth will fight with lasers

citizen militias will hold resistance meetings

a resistance against death

a no-death resistance

a movement for death later

a movement for a different, still-uncontrollable death

'humans don't want to die this way'

will be their manifesto, one sheet of paper

or a piece of cardboard or something

*

there will be humans in basements looking at each other

wandering, solitary humans that want more to find another human than to avoid dying

solitary, severely depressed and/or enlightened humans that commit suicide by seeking out alien faces and looking at them; these humans may feel happy inside an insane nervous breakdown

humans that kill other humans because they feel insane

humans that sit in a corner, feeling extremely small, maybe considering intense killing rampages/some indefinable, positive emotion for humanity

humans that watch tv, use the internet to read the newspaper, and drive their cars around; they will be motionless on couches with their eyes open

*

the fish and insects and trees

will have the ocean and the forest

pretty sure they won't care

The Saturday Afternoon Blues
 

can kill you
can fade your life away
friends are all out shopping
ain't nobody home
suicide hotline is busy
and here i am on my own
with a pill and a bottle for company
and heart full of been done wrong
i'm a candidate for the coroner, a lyric for a song

saturday afternoons are killers
when the air is brisk and warm
ol' sun he steady whispers
soon the life you know will be done
suicide line i can't get you
best friend out of town
alone with a pill and a bottle
i drink my troubles down

the man i love is a killer
the man i love is  thief
the man i love is a junky
the man i love is grief

some call saturday the sabbath
it's the bottom of the line some say
whether last or first, my heart's gonna burst
and there ain't no help my way
here with a pill and a bottle
and a life full of been done wrong
i'm a candidate for the coroner, a lyric
for a song





A Stonehold
 

the thief has made me a gift of his night's booty

somewhere, a daughter discovers her mother's coral
brooch missing, somewhere, a man recoils at the absence
of his gambling stash. somewhere, a miser rifles
over a vanished ransom in newly minted silver

all this to buy a hotbed of memories
to feed the children fresh-killed lies
to open all the locks on love

forever is a moment we hold in our stomachs

as he brushes the smudge of his kiss
across my lips, i smell the cologne of his fear
a robust and smoky aroma mingled
with the woody musk of courtrooms and the stench of
pain-paved alleyways

i take these things and promise to say mum





American Sonnets: 91
 

the gates of mercy slammed on the right foot.
they would not permit return and bent
a wing. there was no choice but
to learn to boogaloo. those horrid days
were not without their pleasure, learning
to swear and wearing mock leather so tight
eyes bulged, a stolen puff or two
behind crack-broken backs and tickled palms
in hallways dark, flirtations during choir practice
as the body organized itself against the will
(a mystic gone ballistic, not home but blood
on the range) as one descended on this effed-up
breeding hole of greeds--to suffer chronic seeings

was't hunger or holiness spurred the sighting?





For My Wife
 

How were we to know, leaving your two kids 
behind in New Hampshire for our honeymoon 
at twenty-one, that it was a trick of cheap 
hotels in New York City to draw customers 
like us inside by displaying a fancy lobby? 
Arriving in our fourth-floor room, we found 
a bed, a scarred bureau, and a bathroom door 
with a cut on one side the exact shape 
of the toilet bowl that was in its way 
when I closed it. I opened and shut the door, 
admiring the fit and despairing of it. You 
discovered the initials of lovers carved 
on the bureau's top in a zigzag, breaking heart. 
How wrong the place was to us then, 
unable to see the portents of our future 
that seem so clear now in the naivete 
of the arrangements we made, the hotel's 
disdain for those with little money, 
the carving of pain and love. Yet in that room 
we pulled the covers over ourselves and lay 
our love down, and in this way began our unwise 
and persistent and lucky life together. 







Preface
 

I was raised in the company of dolls.

My mother, the miniaturist,
made pies the size of thumbnails.

My father, the shadowboxer,
talked only to the dark.

No one here remembers
the love of a chair for its ottoman
or the privacy of a shut door.

Windows grieve in their sashes.
They burn with interior light,
like blood oranges.

Imagine: a dollhouse in every room--

in every room, another room,
in every girl, another girl

looking out a tiny window,
her face repeated on the glass.

As two who could not pretend
to love each other,
we stared through grief.

Pupil, poupe, little doll
orphaned by the iris of my eye:
what did you see, what did you see

but that other girl in me,

the door to whose post was nailed
the smallest coffin,

hiding the name of God inside
like the rust in the mouth.






The Opposite of the Body
 

Of the face in general, let me say it's a house
built by men and lived in by their dreams.

When you've been plucking eyes
out of the floorboards as long as I have,

you'll see this, just as you'd see
the patience it requires

to render an eyebrown, half an hour
and an understanding of architecture.

When you see your body,
think its opposite: not the bridge,

but its lighted face reflecting the water,
some other city as seen from a ship--

your forehead, once ponderous,
now light as umbrellas--

still not beautiful enough to make time stop.
The pleasure in being a woman's

knowing everything's borrowed
and can't be denied,

as when you take apart a clock,
there's always another inside.

The Bones of August
 

      i.

Not to go backward,
           not to watch the women
peddling in reverse past the church,

                     the priest in his black habit
       receding from the chapel door.

Not to go backward,
           the bones of August
becoming the bones of March,

                     branch of dogwood
      picked clean by frost.

Not to say Yes
           when asked the question
all women wait to hear,

                        Are you anything
      like your mother?

Not to be photographed in her dress
           like a saint
carrying the instrument of her martyrdom,

                     Agnes, and her try
      of breasts--

or to throw the bouquet into the grave
            where Bartholomew hides
with his bloody knife.

                       Not to burn
       half the house down--

and build half the house up.
           Not to forgive
the bad child

                      when even the bad house
       is forgiven. Not to care,

not to carry the bones of August
            into September, foiled with redness
and nothing to squander

                     but the buds of spring
        dormant in their boughs.

Not to ask, Did you
           love her? and leave
the answer in the ground,

                     where everything difficult 
       is buried.


      ii.

Attend the dead,
           then welcome the bride--
backward, as Jews do,

                      reading Hebrew,
      right to left.

First the mourning,
          then the celebration.
Backward, taking off

                      the beautiful face
      of forgetting,

two names with the same face--
          all this time
a woman waiting inside me

                     to marry.
        Invisible, impermanent,

windmill girl in her cage
           of breath,
insect girl in her element:

                     impenetrable shell,
     putting on

the beautiful face of forgetting--
             Fury        Sybil      Isis
one of us

                        wakes in her
       graveyard of guilt,

filamentary as fiber optics,
           one of us sleeps on
in the temple, lulled

                        by the metronomic
      pulse of longing--

Did you love her? Are you anything?
             That other girls is dead.
That other girl is dead.

                         What else can be said
        about that other girl?


      iii.

Same as mine,
          skin of her hands
laid over the ivory bones,

                       dark map
       of the body--          Yes--

it was dark,
          but I was darker
on the inside.

                      When she was young
      she was "a great beauty,

in the same sense
          that "a roomful of adults
is rarely ever.

                      I was never
      like her, flattered

like a map
           under glass,
slender as an axle

                     in a turbine--
      enigma relic:

feet of steel, legs of wood,
           cabinet of curiosity.
Even her reflection

                       in a spoon
       was beautiful.


      iv.

Labor into longing:
           wild enthusiasm
of the dynamo engine

                    working in reverse--
     more power

in the leaf of a flower
          than the paw of a bear.
Is it necessary

                      to remember
      absolutely everything?

Golden hour on the birch-
          brailled bark,
weathered barn stacked

                      with malignant logs,
      sweet mulch

of aether /ore
           in the morning air.
We hung drapes

                       over the mirrors,
     they were flowered, too--

her bouquet a cabbage,
           assembled by a florist
from 120 roses

                     Incandescent light
       flattened their petals,

made lace of their thorns.
          Uncanny--nothing in nature
so rigid,

                   nothing more harmful
     than her rare affection.


      v.

August: honeymoon at Niagara,
           water shut off--
bad luck.

                      Two bodies,
      a man's and a woman's

found face-
           down in the mud
at the bottom of the gorge.

                     Neglected
     on the cliffs above,

Tesla's alternating current station,
            powerless
in its pure machinery,

                     honeyed, lunar magnets
     waiting in their sockets

for the current to resume.
           Enough about friction:
this is about two bodies

                     at the end of America,
      repelling each other

under the polar rush of water,
          generating their own distance
over time. Is it history

                      or home
       that hurts us more?

Did she look into the gorge
            as into his face
when she said Yes--

                      to see the downpour,
         even when it was damned?


      vi.

Nothing in me wasted,
           a use for grief, even.
I wore it on my left hand.

                       I was married to it.
       I planted myself

in the dirt:
          alphabets grew up
from the bones of my feet.

                    I drowned my heart
      in the lake.

Black hole, such vanity--
           navigating the ear canals
like so many gondoliers

                      trolling the watery streets
        looking for someone

to sing to. Beautiful
           fisherman who fished
my heart out of its lake--

                      I did not die. I revived.
      I wore her face on my fingers

when I dug up my joy
           up from the ground, singing:
Oh wooden coffin, woman's body,

                         boulder at home
      in its stone skin.


      vii.

Yes, then, to all of it: to the drowned
            sea urchins, porcupines spined,
and the black-brain

                      coral that sleeps
         on the ocean's floor,

ruinously blue. Yes
           to the vultures that roost
above the waterfall,

                       that don't
       surrender their nests

at our dissolution,
          and to the bones that do.
To remember is to open

                      one door
      after another

all along
          the white corridor
to say Yes when asked,

                        Are you anything?
      Did she love you?

To go forward
            is to surrender
the necklace of tears she gave me--

                     this failed body
     with my name on it.







Portrait of Houdini with Wife
 

The pleasure of contrast: not chained up
      in an oilcoth sack underwater,
holding his breath, but composing himself

for the camera, in his only suit.
      You have to understand photography--
unforgiving mirror, unlike oils that soften

the hard edges of a man's face
      if you want them to, or velvet curtain
shielding the pine box during an escape.

The audience imagines his bones contracting
      to a splinter. That's not at all how it's done--
the camera's lens blanketed by cloth

to keep it in the dark; any halo of light
      ruptures the film with shadow. His eyes already
turn inward to that place we're going.

She thinks about escape too:
      at the horse butcher, in line like the others,
or arguing over the price of bread

at the Market of Innocents. Adam's rib
      is forever hidden inside her chest
as the force of blows hibernates in a boxer's fist,

but she, at least, is smiling when he says,
      We have such a small family,
meaning your body

won't open to me--it's shackled
      inside its cage: love and rage,
whose bars are meant to be broken.





Clown
 

It seems like I'm growing more and more like a clown. First of all, I'm always
sad. Secondly, all my knives are made out of rubber. Thirdly, it's like my house 
is on fire.

No, I'm definitely becoming more like a clown. I have a tendency to want to put
on clown clothes. As soon as I put the clown clothes on I feel faintly happier...

Another sign is that I constantly feel like I'm alone in a dressing room. Most 
of the time I feel amused. Anyway, the only thing good about the circus is 
the tigers.

I realize that I could get both legs cut off by the circus train or get frightened
by an elephant. But it's very depressing to sit around in a clown suit and think
about death.

Sometimes I don't feel happy unless I'm in my clown suit. And I enjoy hitting
people on the head with a foam club. I really do...

When people see me they realize that it looks very sophisticated to wear a clown
suit and smoke a cigarette. This is how I get all the ladies because they think I'm
very droll.

People don't understand how you turn into a clown. You turn into a clown 
because you feel more and more like putting on a clown suit. When you're 
around people you sense a kindliness. It makes you so nervous you can't 
stay calm. Which is why it feels perfectly normal to wear orange pants.

Plus, it's very subversive to wear bow ties. You can't imagine how jolly 
everything is. And the fright wigs... I don't want to be a clown but I'm 
sure to be one. My mother was a clown.





Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence
 

I'm writing upside down with the space pen,
listening to the rain.
My wife is writing about the Black Death
and its effects on Art, and asks me
"Where are your pants?
They are on the floor in front
of our new couch, where I arrange them
to spell out L-O-V-E. A vegetable,
mystic thrill runs through me--
the couch is something's antenna. It bears
good love to us here over the laundromat.

I'm waiting for the Light Beings
to remove my roof.
Our bedroom is lousy with clothes
spelling out greetings if anyone's up there
who can read English.





[The dead girl by the beautiful Bartlett]
 

The dead girl by the beautiful Bartlett.
I'm sad. I make horrible sentences.
A woman alone in the park waves. The water.
The dead girl by the beautiful Bartlett.
Put down the cell phone. I'm sad. The waves.
The horrible staring. A woman alone
in the park. Waves. The leaves. Leaves
along in the park. I'm staring. The
dead girl by the beautiful Bartlett. I'm sad.
Put down your cell phone. A wave.
The sad girl alone in the park. Leaves.
Put down your cell phone. The Bartlett.
The staring. A leaf alone in the horrible
leaves. The dead girl. The staring.





Winter
 

A kind of Danish cow
long thought to be extinct
lumbers slowly from a fog-soaked forest.
Past the statue of two men shaking hands on horseback.
Into the trainyard with its newly
brunette-colored coal cars.
It is late, lamps light the trainyard.
One of the trainmen sees the cow and has a thought
like a small grey infant sinking
ever so slowly in the icy harbor.
The cow continues out the other side of the trainyard.
The trainman shudders at the thought.
The trainman's cat Stamina crunches walnuts in her cat dish.

Now, nearly thirty years later,
ladies and gentlemen it is my great pleasure
to introduce to you that very same cow.
(The cow is led out onto the stage by a young boy dressed as a farmer.)







Remembering
 

Remembering you and reviewing
our structural love
the past re-arises alive
from its smothering dust.

For memory, which is only decadent
in hands like a miser's
loving the thing for its thingness,
or in the eyes of collectors who assess
the size, the incredible size, of their collection,
can, in the living head, create and make
new the sometimes appallingly ancient present
and sting the sleeping thing
to a sudden seeing.

And as a tree with all its leaves relaxed
can shiver at the memory of wind
or the still waters of a pool recall
their springing origin and rise and fall
suddenly over the encircling basin's lip--
so I, remembering from now to then,
can know and see and feel again, as jewels
must when held in a brilliant branch of sun.





[Throwing his life away,]
 

Throwing his life away,
      He picks at and smells it.
      Done up. When did I do this up?
      I date its death to the time someone
      Said something.
      Back then.
      Everything else, all striving, making,
      Marrying, error,
      Is this old bird.

Pah! He throws it.
      As the long string lengthens
      Out of his hand,
      It begins unwinding
      The ligaments of his hand.





[Down from another planet they have settled to mend]
 

Down from another planet they have settled to mend
     The Hampton Institute banisters. They wear bow ties and braces.
     The flutings they polish with a polished hand.

     Wingless, they build and repair
     The mansions of what we have thought to be our inheritance.
     Caution and candor they labor to maintain.

     They are out of phase. I prepare
     To burn all gentle structures, greek or thatch,
     Under the masterful torch of my president here and abroad,

     Till stubble outsmolders, and muslim and buddhist crack
     In the orbit of kiln.
                                   A smoke
     To some calm Christian plant will drift,

     To where they are mendijng their mansions, beside of whose doors
     They are standing at ease, they are lifting the fans
     Of unburdenable wings.





Figure
 

A poem I keep forgetting to write
Is about the stars,
How I see them in their order
Even without the chair and bear and the sisters,
In their astronomic presence of great space,
And how beyond and behind my eyes they are moving,
Exploding to spirals under extremest pressure.
Having not mathematics, my head
Bursts with anguish of not understanding.

The poem I forget to write is bursting fragments
Of a tortured victim, far from me
In his galaxy of minds bent upon him,
In the oblivion of his headline status
Crumpled and exploding as incomparable
As a star, yet present in its light.
I forget to write.





Center
 

How did you come
How did I come here
Now it is ours, how did it come to be
In so many presences?
Some I know swept from the sea, wind and sea,
Took up the right wave in their fins and seal suits,
Rode up over the town to this shore
Shining and sleek
To be caught by a tide
As of music, or color, or shape in the heart of the sea.
Was it you?

Was it you who came out from the sea-floor as lab into lab
Weightless, each breath
Bubbling to surface, swaying in currents of kelp plants,
Came in your cars
Freewayed in valleys millions of miles from the shore
To converge where the highways converge saying welcome to here,
And to where?
To tape and percussion, raga computers,
Rare texts and components of clay,
With the sea down away past the freeways and out of the town
To the blockbusting towers of learning and quiet
Shades of administering redwood,
Azure dome over all like a bellflower
And star above star.

Did you come
Out of borderlands dear to the south
Speaking a language Riveran, Nerudan, and saying
Aqui est un hombre; my first lesson?
And come as Quixote, the man of romance
In its new century, tilting
At windmill giants of concrete,
Slim lance at the ready? Woe unto them
That join house to house, that lay field to field
Till there be no place that they may be alone
In the midst of the earth.
Did you come
With a handful of questions
Leaping like jewels
To shock answers, to start
Sparks of inquiry into the evening air?
I came as a kid
From the Midwest all recognize
As part of home,
To this another
Which the salt sea answered in its time
And Viscaino mapped his ports upon.
You came
As concertmaster of hte Philharmonic
As mayor of Del Mar
As reader of magnetic messages in DNA
As archivist for the time's poetry, or PTA,
As land-grant scholar
Holding his gray moon rocks.

What is this that we come to,
Its walls and corridors
Gaping in space, its north lights
Seeking the north, its substance
Concrete brushed by the grains of its boards,
Its boards reaching extension in all of their lenghts
In architectural solidity?
It is
A break in the galaxies of our imagination. It needs our lives
To make it live.

A building, a dark hole in space,
Compact of matter,
Draws into it buzzing disinterests,
Idelologies.
Incomplete being
Enters into the dense room, emerges
Another, further,
Compact of matter, this is the place that we enter,
It paints pictures here and plays drums.
It turns us around and we emerge
Out of old space into the universe.
This building
Between buildings as between galaxies,
Between fields as between flights of fancy,
Will reshape our ears and turn us,
Our work of art
Beating in the breast like a heart.

What are we here for?
To err,
To fail and attempt as terribly as possible, to try
Stunts of such magnitude they will lead
To disasters of such magnitude they will lead
To learnings of such magnitude they will lend
Back in enterprise to substance and grace.
What learning allows for is the making of error
Without fatality.
The wandering off, the aberration,
Distortion and deviation
By which to find again the steady center
And moving center.
What art allows for is the provisional
Enactments of such learning
In their forms
Of color and line, of mass and energy, of sound
And sense
Which bulk disaster large, create evil
To look it in the eye.
To forge
Villainies of the wars, to indispose
Villainies of petty establishment
To make them lead their lives in sound and sense
To no good end, that we may see them so.
To make mistakes
All of our own mistakes
Out of the huddle of possibilities
Into a color and form which will upbraid them
Beyond their being.

Give us to err
Grandly as possible in this complete
Complex of structure, risk a soul
Nobly in north light, in cello tone,
In action of drastic abandonment,
That we return to what we have abandoned
And make it whole.
Domesticate the brushed
Cement and wood marquee,
Fracture the corridors,
Soften the lights of observation and renew
Structural kindness into its gentler shapes.

Out of the sea
The kelp tangles, out of the south
The cities crowd, out of the sky
The galaxies emerge in isolation
One from another, and the faces here
Look one to antoher in surprise
At what has been made.
Look at the actual
Cliffs and canyons of this place,
People and programs, mass and energy
Of fact, 
Look at the possibilities.
Irradiating all these possibilities.

Praise then
The arts of law and science as of life
The arts of sound and substance as of faith
Which claim us here
To take, as a building, as a fiction, takes us,
Into another frame of space
Where we can ponder, celebrate, and reshape
Not only what we are, where we are from,
But what in the risk and moment of our day
We may become.





The Despairing Man Draws a Serpent
 

I went up the hill
At moonrise.

She swore that she would come
By the south way.

A dusky hawk
Caught up the path
In his talons.





Niagara
 

I

Driving westward near Niagara, that transfiguring of the waters,
I was torn--as moon from orbit by a warping of gravitation--
From coercion of the freeway to the cataract's prodigality,
Had to stand there, breathe its rapture, inebriety of the precipice . . .

Fingers clamped to iron railings in a tremor of earth's vibration,
I look upstream: foam and boulders wail with a biblical desolation,
Tree roots, broken oar, a pier end, wrack of the continent dissolving . . .

Braced, like tunnel workers hunching from implosion of locomotives,
I look down: to ancient chaos, scrawl of the fog for commentary,
Misty scripture--Delphic, Jungian--all mythology in gestation,
Mists that chill our face in passing, soar to a mushroom luminescence . . .

In between, where halos dazzle--as, on a high wire, spangled dancers--
On the brink those waters sluice to, in the devil-may-care insouciance
Of their roistering to glory, no forewarning of what impends, till
Solid earth dissolves beneath them; all they had banked on once, vacuity . . .

Kindled in the hollow wind they flare to a greenish incandescence;
Channels they defined so smartly in the gusto of their careening
All behind them now; before them, blinding haze and the noon's diffusion . . .


                                             II

Ten feet over those, our railing perched on a spur where verge and void--there!--
Hiss and arc to touch each other, matter and shadow-matter fuming, 
We stare through the flow to bedrock, flashing its Kodachrome geology.
Images swirl by--real, fancied--bits of hallucinated litter:
Gold of oak leaf, taffy wrapper, lavender airmail--assignation?
Yellow Kodak pack, pied comics, tissue a crimson lip had stippled
(Let's imagine). Some shows vivid, fresh-shellacked in the river's sepia, 
All no sooner seen than vanished--on to the brink, its foaming rotos
Hoarse as all earth's turbines turning in a thunder of synchronicity.
How deep toward the edge? waist? shoulder? as through a woozy lens we scan its
Floor, old temple tesselation--
                                            No, terrain of the moon! Medusa's
Ancient face, and we stare frozen: stony glare in its vipers' tangle . . .

Still a thought returns and troubles: "no forewarning of what impends, till--
Shadow of impends--more menace coiled in the word than fact itself has:
Fact erodes in action: Athens, in the arroyos of her theater,
Leaned to watch the self-destructing of her blinded grandiosities,
Willfulness and Will, a crash course; then, too late for it, anagnorisis;
Purged of trivia through immersion in the clotted baths of tragedy,
Then she knew and was transfigured by contrarious exaltations . . .


                                          III

Eyes can't leave the livid seething, its reiterative Memento!
Reading, in this bubble chamber, stuff of the world as effervescence, 
Reading every life as half-life, reading in foam the one prognosis . . .

Mac the trucker--checkered mackinaw, sort of a baseball cap with earflaps,
Fists to crinkle up his beer cans--here at the falls is philosophical:
"Down the tube. That's life--he's waggish, nudging his cozy blonde--"You
                                                                                             know, hon?
And she knows. We all know: Nature, making a splendor of our banalities,
Lavishes Niagara on us, nudging our knack for the anagogical . . .

Meanwhile, earth itself rolls over, nations caught in its tug of traction,
From the brink of noon to darkness (but the grandeur of the transition!)
Gone, like taffy wrapper, tissue:
                                               ferny world of the stegosaurus,
Heraclitus, toe in rivers, Coriolanus in Corioli,
Dancing T'ang girl, belles of Bali, kings of France with the Roman numerals, 
Gone, the fripperies and follies glossed in an Architectural Digest,
Halls of mortuary marble, dinky glitz of the rare objet, the 
Aubusson, netsuke, scrimshaw, Tiffany, Tanagra, Bohara,
All things au courant, things current--what a word with the gorge before us!--
All our bookshelves, facts in folio, paleontology, agronomy, 
Jewels from that cluttered dump, statistics--
                                                                 many a scuffed Aladdin's lamp there:
As: one cell's genetic lore'd fill seventy-five Manhattan phone books;
As: for each poor soul among us, many a galaxy out there somewhere,
Each of us more precious--rarer!--than a glittering island universe . . .

We could catalogue forever; there's no end to the world's diversity,
All that affluence from somewhere, more than a continent behind it;
There's no diminution either from the torrential cornucopia
Since that primal burst of fireworks, first explosion from singularity;
All the things, their scree, diluvium--go to the malls for confirmation:
Lurid brass shop, teak shop, tech shop, patio 'n' pool shop, campy duds shop . . .


                                             IV

Most we're through with soon enough, but some! how they lacerate the heart--not
Savage indignation's gash--but thrilling, with finer blade, pain's inmost
Nerve: the unsigned card I love you kept in a bureau drawer for decades;
Sweater she wore once, that autumn, rich with the campfire musk; then letters,
Lavish o, impulsive flourish, "When you're away, in other cities,
It's their weather reports I look for, first thing in the morning papers . . .
So once the Provenal poet, in his rapture about freid' aura:
"Winter winds that blow from your land
                                                          feel like heaven upon my cheek here . . .

They've gone too, Provence and poet, off in the jumble-carts of history,
Who was she? that rueful beauty, jewel of the court and joy of kings, who
Dying murmured, "Je me regrette!--wistful dear, with her curls disheveled 
On that last of all her pillows, feeling the dark impend--"I'll miss me!
Images swirl by: chteaux that dance in the pool's hallucination,
Ftes and follies effervescing--champagne, glass, and the hand that held them--
Last, herself, the self where soul is, world of her lavalieres and lovers.
Did she dream, through mists arising, how on the high wire, floodlit dancer,
She had lived her brilliant moment? Hear, as the blood ran hushed, sonorous
Thunders of the living river, more than a continent its source? And
Not divine--so near the brink where verve like hers and the void meet, seething--
Wreathed in opulence of sunset, some transfiguring of the waters?





Nests in Elms
 

The rooks are cawing  up and down the trees! 
Among their nests they caw. O sound I treasure, 
Ripe as old music is, the summer's measure, 
Sleep at her gossip, sylvan mysteries, 
With prate and clamour to give zest of these-- 
In rune I trace the ancient law of pleasure, 
Of love, of all the busy-ness of leisure, 
With dream on dream of never-thwarted ease. 
O homely birds, whose cry is harbinger 
Of nothing sad, who know not anything 
Of sea-birds' loneliness, of Procne's strife, 
Rock round me when I die! So sweet it were 
To die by open doors, with you on wing 
Humming the deep security of life.





Gravity
 

Mildest of all the powers of earth: no lightnings 
For her--maniacal in the clouds. No need for
Signs with their skull and crossbones, chain-link gates:
Danger! Keep Out! High Gravity! she's friendlier.
Won't nurse--unlike the magnetic powers--repugnance;
Would reconcile, draw close: her passion's love.

No terrors lurking in her depths, like those
Bound in that buzzing strongbox of the atom,
Terrors that, lossened, turn the hills vesuvian,
Trace in cremation where the cities were.

No, she's our quiet mother, sensible.
But therefore down-to-earth, not suffering
Fools who play fast and loose among the mountains,
Who fly in her face, or, drunken, clown on cornices.

She taught our ways of walking. Her affection
Adjusted the morning grass, the sands of summer
Until our soles fit snug in each, walk easy.
Holding her hand, we're safe. Should that hand fail,
The atmosphere we breathe would turn hysterical,
Hiss with tornadoes, spinning us from earth
Into the cold unbreathable desolations.

Yet there--in fields of space--is where she shines,
Ring-mistress of the circus of the stars,
Their prancing carousels, their ferris wheels
Lit brilliant in celebration. Thanks to her
All's gala in the galaxy. 

                                   Down here she
Walks us just right, not like the jokey moon
Burlesquing our human stride to kangaroo hops;
Not like vast planets, whose unbearable mass
Would crush us in a bear hug to their surface
And into the surface, flattened. No: deals fairly.
Makes happy each with each: the willow bend
Just so, the acrobat land true, the keystone
Nestle in place for bridge and for cathedral.
Let us pick up--or mostly--what we need:
Rake, bucket, stone to build with, logs for warmth,
The fallen fruit, the fallen child . . . ourselves.

Instructs us too in honesty: our jointed
Limbs move awry and crisscross, gawky, thwart;
She's all directness and makes that a grace, 
All downright passion for the core of things,
For rectitude, the very ground of being:
Those eyes are leveled where the heart is set.

See, on the tennis court this August day:
How, beyond human error, she's the one
Whose will the bright balls cherish and obey
--As if in love. She's tireless in her courtesies
To even the klutz (knees, elbows all a-tangle),
Allowing his poky serve Euclidean whimsies,
The looniest lob its joy: serene parabolas.





Turn Off the TV!
 

My father gets quite mad at me;
my mother gets upset--
when they catch me watching
our new television set.

My father yells, "Turn that thing off!
Mom says, "It's time to study.
I'd rather watch my favorite TV show
with my best buddy.

I sneak down after homework
and turn the set on low.
But when she sees me watching it,
my mother yells out, "No!

Dad says, "If you don't turn it off,
I'll hang it from a tree!
I rather doubt he'll do it,
'cause he watches more than me.

He watches sports all weekend,
and weekday evenings too,
while munching chips and pretzels--
the room looks like a zoo.

So if he ever got the nerve
to hang it from a tree,
he'd spend a lot of time up there--
watching it with me.





My Puppy Loves Flowers
 

My puppy's in the garden.
He loves to smell the flowers.
To help them grow my puppy always
sprinkles them with showers.





Stop Sniffling!
 

If you should have the sniffles,
you'd better blow your nose.
Because if you should go "Achoo!
you'll mess up all your clothes.





How I Quit Sucking My Thumb
 

My mother says it's childish and
my father says it's dumb--
whenever they discover that
I'm sucking on my thumb.

It's such a silly thing to do,
as everybody knows.
So now instead of sucking it
I stick it in my nose.





Scrambled
 

I climbed up the door and
I opened the stairs.
I said my pajamas
and buttoned my prayers.

I turned off the covers
and pulled up the light.
I'm all scrambled up since
she kissed me last night.





My Office
 

I've spent the last 10 years
In other people's offices
Learning the alphabet of nods and eyebrows
And pursed lips, straining for the purse
Legs crossed in easy confidence
Confident nervous gestures of assurance
Approved blue suits
And sudden dreamed-up lies to be delivered

A net of thirty days and sixty days and ninety
Insanely stretched past promise into years
Next week, for certain
Floated haphazardly on possibles
As slight as handshakes,
Firm as agreements of subjective verbs

And got nowhere.

This happy corner, sucking up hard-boiled eggs
And polish hots
The seidel sliding down the polished bar
Clatter of friendly pool balls in the margin
Not exactly somewhere, but a certain place.

A regular's dark hair and polished eyes
Glow in the glasses lined before her face
Smoking and berating the muzak
"Jack, when you gonna get some country music?

"Country Charlie Pride?

Outside, it's as bright as the important phone call
I always pretend to await
Setting up the lunch meeting at Stouffer's
Linen napkins and hope's frozen green peas

Set up another round of handshake laughter for the pictures

"Hey sweet thing, when we gonna have that date?
The barmaid pouts a 1940s frown--
It's Arnie (reaching now to slap me on the back)
A gleaming brazen polyester clown,
Tuesday seems longer than the day before
Since I began to organize my life around My Office
I stay a little later every day.
A little rain hangs fire in the clouds

Next trip, I think I'll bring the wife





Inauguration
 

The land was there before us
Was the land. Then things
Began happening fast. Because
The bombs us have always work
Sometimes it makes me think
God must be one of us. Because
Us has saved the world. Us gave it
A particular set of regulations
Based on 1) undisputable acumen.
2) carnivorous fortunes, delicately
Referred to here as "bull market
And (of course) other irrational factors
Deadly smoke thick over the icecaps,
Our man in Saigon   Lima   Tokyo   etc   etc





The Leopard
 

The eyeballs on her behind are like fire
Leaping and annoying
The space they just passed
Just like fire would do

The ground have no mouth to complain
And the girl is not braver herself

She is beautiful in her spotted
Leopard ensemble. Heartless so

To keep her fashionalbe in New York
Leopards are dying

Crude comments flutter around her
At lunchtime. She sure look good
She remembers nine banishing speeches

More powerful than this is the seam
Of the leotard under her clothing

Her tail in the leotard is never still
The seam!
She feels it too familiar on her leg
As some crumb says something suggestive 

The leopard embracing around her
Is too chic to leap and strike

Her thoughts fall back to last semester's karate

Underneath, the leotard crouches up on her thigh
It is waiting for its terrible moment!





MMDCCXIII 1/2
 

The cruelty of ages past affects us now
Whoever it was who lived here lived a mean life
Each door has locks designed for keys unknown

Our living room was once somebody's home
Our bedroom, someone's only room
Our kitchen had a hasp upon its door.

Door to a kitchen?

And our lives are hasped and boundaried
Because of ancient locks and madnesses
Of slumlord greed and desperate privacies

Which one is madness? Depends on who you are.
We find we cannot stay, the both of us, in the same room
Dance, like electrons, out of each other's way.

The cruelties of ages past affect us now





Democracy
 

When you're cold--November, the streets icy and everyone you pass
homeless, Goodwill coats and Hefty bags torn up to make ponchos--
someone is always at the pay phone, hunched over the receiver

spewing winter's germs, swollen lipped, face chapped, making the last
tired connection of the day. You keep walking to keep the cold
at bay, too cold to wait for the bus, too depressing the thought

of entering that blue light, the chilled eyes watching you decide
which seat to take: the man with one leg, his crutches bumping
the smudged window glass, the woman with her purse clutched

to her breasts like a dead child, the boy, pimpled, morose, his head
shorn, a swastika carved into the stubble, staring you down.
So you walk into the cold you know: the wind, indifferent blade,

familiar, the gold leaves heaped along the gutters. You have
a home, a house with gas heat, a toilet that flushes. You have
a credit card, cash. You could take a taxi if one would show up.

You can feel it now: why people become Republicans: Get that dog
off the street. Remove that spit and graffiti. Arrest those people huddled
on the steps of the church. If it weren't for them you could believe in god,

in freedom, the bus would appear and open its doors, the driver dressed
in his tan uniform, pants legs creased, dapper hat: Hello Miss, watch
your step now. But you're not a Republican. You're only tired, hungry,

you want out of the cold. So you give up, walk back, step into line behind
the grubby vet who hides a bag of wine under his pea coat, holds out
his grimy 85 cents, takes each step slow as he pleases, releases his coins

into the box and waits as they chink down the chute, stakes out a seat
in the back and eases his body into the stained vinyl to dream
as the chips of shrapnel in his knee warm up and his good leg

flops into the aisle. And you'll doze off, too, in a while, next to the girl
who can't sit still, who listens to her Walkman and taps her boots
to a rhythm you can't hear, but you can see it--when she bops

her head and her hands do a jive in the air--you can feel it
as the bus rolls on, stopping at each red light in a long wheeze,
jerking and idling, rumbling up and lurching off again.





Whats Broken
 

The slate black sky. The middle step
of the back porch. And long ago

my mother's necklace, the beads
rolling north and south. Broken

the rose stem, water into drops, glass
knobs on the bedroom door. Last summer's

pot of parsley and mint, white roots
shooting like streamers through the cracks.

Years ago the cat's tail, the bird bath,
the car hood's rusted latch. Broken

little finger on my right hand at birth--
I was pulled out too fast. What hasn't 

been rent, divided, split? Broken
the days into nights, the night sky

into stars, the stars into patterns
I make up as I trace them

with a broken-off blade
of grass. Possible, unthinkable,

the cricket's tiny back as I lie
on the lawn in the dark, my heart

a blue cup fallen from someone's hands.





In Memoriam
 

Today is Sunday.
I fear the crowd of my fellows with such faces of stone.
From my glass tower filled with headaches and impatient Ancestors,
I contemplate the roofs and hilltops in the mist.
In the stillness--somber, naked chimneys.
Below them my dead are asleep and my dreams turn to ashes.
All my dreams, blood running freely down the streets
And mixing with blood from the butcher shops.
From this observatory like the outskirts of town
I contemplate my dreams lost along the streets,
Crouched at the foot of the hills like the guides of my race
On the rivers of the Gambia and the Saloum
And now on the Seine at the foot of these hills.
Let me remember my dead!
Yesterday was All Saints' Day, the solemn anniversary of the Sun,
And I had no dead to honor in any cemetery.
O Forefathers! You who have always refused to die,
Who knew how to resist Death from the Sine to the Seine,
And now in the fragile veins of my indomitable blood,
Guard my dreams as you did your thin-legged migrant sons!
O Ancestors! Defend the roofs of Paris in this dominical fog,
The roofs that protect my dead.
Let me leave this tower so dangerously secure
And descend to the streets, joining my brothers
Who have blue eyes and hard hands.





Luxembourg 1939
 

This Luxembourg morning, this Luxembourg autumn,
As I walk back and forth upon my youth,
No strollers, no fountains, no boats in the water,
No children, no flowers.
Ah! September flowers and the sunburnt shouts of children
Defying the coming winter.
Now only two old fellows trying to play tennis.
This autumn morning without children--the children's theater closed!
This Luxembourg where I no longer find my youth,
The years as fresh as cut grass.
Comrades, my dreams are vanquished in despair, are they not?
Here they fall like leaves with other leaves,
Older, mortally wounded, trampled, bitter with blood,
Gathered together for what common grave?

I no longer know this Luxembourg, those soldiers at attention.
They set up cannons to protect the Senators' aimless retirement
They dig trenches under the bench where I learned about
The sweet budding of lips.
This sign, ah! yes, of dangerous youth! . . .
I watch the leaves fall into these false shelters, into graves
Into trenches where the blood of an entire generation flows
Europe is burying the nations' leaven
And the hope of new races.





To New York
 

(for jazz orchestra and trumpet solo)

New York! At first I was bewildered by your beauty,
Those huge, long-legged, golden girls.
So shy, at first, before your blue metallic eyes and icy smile,
So shy. And full of despair at the end of skyscraper streets
Raising my owl eyes at the eclipse of the sun.
Your light is sulphurous against the pale towers
Whose heads strike lightning into the sky,
Skyscrapers defying storms with their steel shoulders
And weathered skin of stone.
But two weeks on the naked sidewalks of Manhattan--
At the end of the third week the fever
Overtakes you with a jaguar's leap
Two weeks without well water or pasture all birds of the air
Fall suddenly dead under the high, sooty terraces.
No laugh from a growing child, his hand in my cool hand.
No mother's breast, but nylon legs. Legs and breasts
Without smell or sweat. No tender word, and no lips,
Only artificial hearts paid for in cold cash
And not one book offering wisdom.
The painter's palette yields only coral crystals.
Sleepless nights, O nights of Manhattan!
Stirring with delusions while car horns blare the empty hours
And murky streams carry away hygenic loving
Like rivers overflowing with the corpses of babies.

                                          II
Now is the time of signs and reckoning, New York!
Now is the time of manna and hyssop.
You have only to listen to God's trombones, to your heart
Beating to the rhythm of blood, your blood.
I saw Harlem teeming with sounds and ritual colors
And outrageous smells--
At teatime in the home of the drugstore-deliveryman
I saw the festival of Night begin at the retreat of day.
And I proclaim Night more truthful than the day.
It is the pure hour when God brings forth
Life immemorial in the streets,
All the amphibious elements shinning like suns.
Harlem, Harlem! Now I've seen Harlem, Harlem!
A green breeze of corn rising from the pavements
Plowed by the Dan dancers' bare feet,
Hips rippling like silk and spearhead breasts,
Ballets of water lilies and fabulous masks
And mangoes of love rolling from the low houses
To the feet of police horses.
And along sidewalks I saw streams of white rum
And streams of black milk in the blue haze of cigars.
And at night I saw cotton flowers snow down
From the sky and the angels' wings and sorcerers' plumes.
Listen, New York! O listen to your bass male voice,
Your vibrant oboe voice, the muted anguish of your tears
Falling in great clots of blood,
Listen to the distant beating of your nocturnal heart,
The tom-tom's rhythm and blood, tom-tom blood and tom-tom.

                                       III
New York! I say New York, let black blood flow into your blood.
Let it wash the rust from your steel joints, like an oil of life
Let it give your bridges the curve of hips and supple vines.
Now the ancient age returns, unity is restored,
The reconciliation of the Lion and Bull and Tree
Idea links to action, the ear to the heart, sign to meaning.
See your rivers stirring with musk alligators
And sea cows with mirage eyes. No need to invent the Sirens.
Just open your eyes to the April rainbow
And your eyes, especially your ears, to God
Who in one burst of saxophone laughter
Created heaven and earth in six days,
And on the seventh slept a deep Negro sleep.





Night in Sine
 

Woman, place your soothing hands upon my brow,
Your hands softer than fur.
Above us balance the palm trees, barely rustling
In the night breeze. Not even a lullaby.
Let the rhythmic silence cradle us.
Listen to its song. Hear the beat of our dark blood,
Hear the deep pulse of Africa in the mist of lost villages.

Now sets the weary moon upon its slack seabed
Now the bursts of laughter quiet down, and even the storyteller
Nods his head like a child on his mother's back
The dancers' feet grow heavy, and heavy, too,
Come the alternating voices of singers.

Now the stars appear and the Night dreams
Leaning on that hill of clouds, dressed in its long, milky pagne.
The roofs of the huts shine tenderly. What are they saying
So secretly to the stars? Inside, the fire dies out
In the closeness of sour and sweet smells.

Woman, light the clear-oil lamp. Let the Ancestors
Speak around us as parents do when the children are in bed.
Let us listen to the voices of the Elissa Elders. Exiled like us
They did not want to die, or lose the flow of their semen in the sands.
Let me hear, a gleam of friendly souls visits the smoke-filled hut,
My head upon your breast as warm as tasty dang streaming from the fire,
Let me breathe the odor of our Dead, let me gather
And speak with their living voices, let me learn to live
Before plunging deeper than the diver
Into the great depths of sleep.





When All Hands Were Called to Make Sail
 

for Spalding Gray
The West and North winds both lover us, wanting, bitter,
to bring us in close in the small hold.

Tongues loll and laze, while the flap
and snapping above: crazy wanderlust.

The basin must cradle, keep her passengers,
though the hero abandoned the ferry for the real sea.

Is nothing worthy?

        Wallet on bench. Wallet at home. Wallet at rest.

The child, even his cries, must the ship balance,
makes me wild to right this unhumanly keeling.

I have six arms, am the dismembered figurehead,
ballast, breasts covered in blue scales.

I am at rudder, at bow, at mast, at rigging,
at deck, at halyard, at stern, when the hold

explodes with screaming.

One boy has stolen the other's marble. The boat shifts, tilts.
A wallet washes up against us.

Is this what you meant when you said a family steadied you?

Is this what they see when they see me and my six handless arms,
shining torso and cuspid humor?

The figurehead has no need for eyelids, must
on-guard, vigil, dry eyed.

But she dreams. Dreams.

The sail, its fine apparel, its linen long-shadow: a tiny hand
opening, budlike





Hey Allen Ginsberg Where Have You Gone and What Would You Think of My Drugs?
 

listen, a bad thing happened to
my friend's marriage, can't tell you
only can tell my own story which
so far isn't so bad:

"Dad and I stay married. so far.
so good. so so.

But it felt undoable. This lucky life
every day, every day. every, day.

(all the poetry books the goddamn same
until one guy gets up and stuns the audience.)

Joe Wenderoth, not by a long shot
sober, says, I promised my wife I wouldn't fuck
anyone to no one in particular and reads a poem
about how Jesus had no penis.

Meanwhile, the psychiatrist, attractive
in a fatherly way, says, Libido question mark.

And your libido?
like a father, but not like mine, or my sons'--

fix it.

My friend Nathan's almost written
a good novel, by which I mean finished,
which means I'd like to light myself
on fire--this isn't "desire,
not what the Dr. meant
by libido?

                                          I hope--

not, it's just chemical:
              jealousy. boredom. lethargy.

Books with prominent serifs: their feet feet feet I am
marching to the same be--

other

than the neuronic slave I thought anxiety made me
do it, made me get up and carry forth, sally
the children to school the poems dragged
by little hands on their little serifs
to the page, my marriage sustained, remaining
energy: project #1, project #2, broken
fixtures, summer plans, demands met, requests
granted, bunny noodles with and without cheesy
at the same time, and the nighttime, I insomnia
these hours penning invisible letters--

                          till it stopped.

doc said: It's a syndrome. You've got it,
                                          classic.

It's chemical,
mental
circuitry, we've got a fix for this
classic, I'm saying I can

make it better.

Everything was the same, then,
but better.

At night I slept.
In the morning got up.

Kids to school, husband still a fool-
hardy spirit makes
me pick a Monday morning fight, snipe! I'll pay for that
later I'm still a pain in the 
elbow from writing prose those shift+hold+letter,
I'm still me less sleepy, crazy, I suppose
less crazy-jealous just
haha now at Jesus' no penis
amazed at the other poet's kick-ass
friend's novel I dream instead about
the government makes me put stickers
on my driver's license of family members
who are Jews, and mine all are. Can they get us
all? I escape with a beautiful light-haired man,
blue-eyed day trader, gentile.

                                                     (( gentle, gentle, mind encased in its

                                                     sleep, sleep and sleepy wake and want
                                                     to sleep and sleep a steep dosage--

                                                                      "--chemical? ))

in my dreams now every man's mine, no
problem, perhaps my mind's a little plastic,
malleable, not so fatal now

the dose is engineered like that new genetic watercress
to turn from green to red when planted over buried
mines, nitrogen dioxide makes for early autumn,
red marks the spot where I must
watch my step, up one half-step-dose specific--


The psychiatrist's lived in NY so long
he's of ambiguous religion--
everyone's Jewish sometimes--
writes: "Up the dosage.

                                                did that get me but, that inevitable location

"Up the dosage.

Brown a first-cut brisket in hot Dutch oven
after dusting with paprika. Remove. Saut
thickly sliced onions and add wine (sweet
is better, lasts forever, never need a new bottle).
Put the meat on onions, cover with tomato-sauce-
onion-soup-mix mixture, cover. Back in low oven
many hours.


This year, I'll be better;
trying to get out of Egypt.

The house smells like meat.
My hair smells like meat.

I'm a light unto the nation.


Joseph makes sense of the big man's dreams, is saved,
saves his brothers those jealous boys who sold him
sold them all as slaves. Seven years of plenty. Seven
years of famine. He insomnias the nights counting up
grains, storing, planning, for what? They say throw
the small boys in the river (and mothers do so). Smite
the sons (and fathers do it). God says take off your shoes,
this holy ground this pitiful, incombustible bush.

Is God chemical?
Enzymatic of our great need to chaos?

We're unforgivable. People of the salted
cheeks. Slap, turn, slap.


To be chosen is to be
unforgiving/unforgiv-
en, always chosen:
be better.

Truth is, the anti-obsessional medicine works

About this time of year but years ago
the priests spread rumors of blood libel.
Jews huddled in basements accused
of using Christian babes' blood
to make unleavened bread.

Signs and wonders.
Christ rises.

Blood and body and babes.
Basements and briskets
and bread of afflictions.

[I] am calm now with my pounds of meat
made and frozen, my party schedule, my pills
of liberation, my gentile dream-boy, American
passport, my gray-haired psychiatrist, my blue-
eyed son, my brown-eyed son, my poems on their
pretty little fleet-feet, my big shot friends, olive-skinned
husband, my right elbow on fire: fire inside deep in the nerve
from too much carrying and word-mongering, smithery, bearing
and tensing, choosing to be better to live this real life this better orbit this Jack

did you know that Pharaoh actually wanted
to let them go? those multitude Jews
but God hardened Paraoh's heart against them [Jews]
to prove his prowess, show his signs, wonders, outstretched
hand, until the dosage was a perfect ten and then
some, sea closing up around those little chariots
the men and horses while women on the far shore shook
their tambourines. And then what?

Because of this. Bloody Nile. My story
one of the lucky. Escaped hatch even from
my own obsess--


                                         I am here because of this.
Because of what my ancestors did for me to tell this
story of the outstretched hand what it did for me this
marked door and behind this red-marked door, around
a corner a blue-eyed boy waits to love me up with his
leavened bread, his slim body, professional detachment,
medical advancments, forgive me my father's mother's
father was the last in a long line of rabbis--again! with this? This
rhapsody of affliction and escape, the mind bobbing along
in its watery safe. Be like everyone. Else. Indistinguishable but
better than the other nations. But that's what got us into this, Allen,
no one writes these long-ass poems anymore. Now we're
better, all better. All Christian. Kind.






Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
 

                                                                    Saturday morning
two hawks flew over the soccer field and swooped in low
as Abram almost scored a goal. Moses, on the sideline, sat
on a stray ball reading a book, not looking up at the game
or the hawks or his brother who noticed. That night
at the Basic Trust Day Care Poker Tournament I got knocked 
out with queen/nine against queen/jack by Dan Shiffman
who seemed almost sad to beat me. I sucked on ginger candies
and held new baby Phoebe Kate, born on the same due date
as the baby I miscarried. When she left I cried and had more candies.
In the end, Josh beat everyone and won a 40-inch flat-screen TV.


                                                                    Sunday morning
I couldn't sleep so got up early, went to the Hell's Kitchen
flea market and bought a dining table and chairs from a man
named Toney. Bargained him down to $690 (including delivery)
because "the chairs need new upholstery. A 1950ish Danish
with expandable top and funny splayed feet--it reminds me
of my late Grandma Lotty, her sister Marguerite, and the heavy-laden
tables of childhood. I've no idea what it will look like
with my small family gathered round or if I'll overworry
the polished surface. We'll see--
it arrives on Tuesday.


                                                                    This morning
I got a stack of papers from sophomore lit. The top two
had the author's name misspelled. I've not yet looked at
any others. I talked in class about how Art Spiegelman
chose realism over sentiment, how we conflate historical time
with personal time, how on 9/11 I took my nine-month old son
to his first day of day care and the city expoloded, went up
in smoke, and no one but me cares that he spent hours there,
only nine months old, while we watched TV in our phone-jammed
airspace, breathed in fumes, tried to give blood, wondered was there
anywhere, anywhere we could or should
                                                                                               flee to?--


Josh called right after class and said he'd gotten "strong intent from an agent
who's "all about the money.


Nothing disastrous happened this week. Not so far. Unless you count
what I saw next, between classes on my way to read student poems
at Empanada Mama's on 48th and 9th. A teenage boy lying on his side
in the middle of the street. The traffic stopped and a crowd watched
while six or seven other boys ran back and forth and stamped down
hard on his skull. I turn a gag into a kind of cough and dial 911
We've already called the fucking police, says a woman as I retch
into an empty trash can. Finally three teenage girls surround the boy
and the other boys move off.


                                                                                Later,
on my way back to Fordham, I stop a cop and ask
about the boy. EMTs got him, says the officer.
They had no shame, no fear, even with all of us watching . . . I tell him.
They're kids, ma'am, he says. You know what kids is like.


                                                                              Tonight
in Writer's Workshop I & II I read two cantos from Model Homes
by Wayne Koestenbaum and then "A Poet's Life by David Trinidad.
These poems hijack form and make it present, contemporary, immediate. Look how
Wayne puts a plumber and lovers, his mother, porn mags, fashion into terza rima
that lead us along, punch drunk, addicted to real life. And oh how David's crown
of sonnets breaks our hearts! The students stare blankly; one:
               These are sonnets?
and someone's cell phone rings with the sound of a human voice pleading:
Pick up! Pick up! Pick up!


                                                                                 After an hour
we head upstairs to hear Linda Gregg, Saskia Hamilton, and Tess Gallagher.
Linda says, I had a husband once named John and we did mushrooms
and John said, "We're lost but hey don't worry because when it gets dark I can read
the stars and I said "I don't know what you're talking about. We're not lost.
We're right here. And my students, aghast at who knows what,
start passing notes and rustling papers. Tess talks about her cancer
and the ghosts within and Saskia reads poems thick with grief,
some in a cracked guttural tongue I think is Danish.


                                                                                   When I get home
and try to describe the boy in the street Josh says, More people died
in Iraq this month than any other and I remind him that tomorrow morning,
before the new table is due to be delivered, we're going to Saint Vincent's
Hospital where Dr. Margano will put the KY-covered wand inside me
and tell us if these past nine weeks have yielded a fetal heartbeat
which will change everything, nothing.






I have to tell you
 

I have to tell you, 
there are times when 
the sun strikes me 
like a gong, 
and I remember everything, 
even your ears.





For Allen Ginsberg
 

Among other things,
thanks for explaining 
how the generous death 
of old trees 
forms 
the red powdered floor 
of the forest.





The Two Times I Loved You the Most In a Car
 

It was your idea 
to park and watch the elephants 
swaying among the trees 
like royalty 
at that make-believe safari 
near Laguna.
I didn't know anything that big 
could be so quiet.

And once, you stopped 
on a dark desert road 
to show me the stars 
climbing over each other 
riotously
like insects
like an orchestra 
thrashing its way 
through time itself 
I never saw light that way 
again.





Noon Concert
 

These frail, white widows 
who get their hair done weekly 
in tight curls, 
like little flowers, 
bend their heads 
until the applause 
says it's time 
to be brave again.





I knew something was wrong
 

I knew something was wrong 
the day I tried to pick up a 
small piece of sunlight 
and it slithered through my fingers, 
not wanting to take shape. 
Everything else stayed the same--
the chairs and the carpet 
and all the corners 
where the waiting continued.





I allow myself
 

I allow myself 
the luxury of breakfast 
(I am no nun, for Christ's sake). 
Charmed as I am 
by the sputter of bacon, 
and the eye-opening properties 
of eggs, 
it's the coffee 
that's really sacramental. 
In the old days, 
I spread fires and floods and pestilence
on my toast. 
Nowadays, I'm more selective, 
I only read my horoscope 
by the quiet glow of the marmalade.






It is not so much that I miss you
 

It is not so much that I miss you
as the remembering
which I suppose is a form of missing
except more positive,
like the time of the blackout
when fear was my first response
followed by love of the dark.






Love Poem
 

In a lightning bolt
of memory,
I see our statue of Buddha
(a wedding gift from Uncle Gene)
which always sat
on top of the speaker cabinet.
When a visitor asked,
"So, does Buddha like jazz?
you said, "I hope so.
He's been getting it up the ass
for a long time.





[Untitled]
 

I don't own an exquisite way to move around in the night                            --Doug Benezra
It occurs to me that,
when I die,
they might find the necklace
I dropped behind the bed
and wonder
how long it was there,
and whether I'd missed it.
But will they care
about my favorite color,
my long-range plans,
or my habit of searching myself 
for signs of rust?





five-story house in laleli
 

one lies in rags on the street
and his stomach is empty
and he wishes for death

one sits with friends at tea and backgammon
and his mind is empty
and he wishes for death

one sits in a straight-backed chair at a desk
and his bank account is empty
and he wishes for death

one lies in bed staring out to sea
and the place next to him in bed is empty
and he wishes for death

one flies back with food in its beak
and its nest is empty
and only this one says
we should give it another try





means to an end
 

saw hammer drill
needle and tongs
are there any tools
that weren't from the beginning
misused for torture and killing

throw away the tools
even the nails on your fingers
can scratch
and about the tongue
the chinese have a saying,
it can pulverize a person

is there not some means that peace
can call its own

erect a house 
made of blossom petals
and bird down
capacious as a dream
and no one will live in it

all we have is 
what keeps its form
to hold something together
you must use force
even for peace





absence or a record of the creation of a fabulous animal
 

on the first day you were beautiful and good
on the second you grew a horn
on the third a lead-gray wing budded
from your shoulder
on the fourth a claw sprouted from your shoe
on the fifth you flew
right into my armpit
built a nest and then lost interest
on the sixth you were a host of leeches
having their way with my veins
on the seventh I heard you
trotting above me with hollow hoof beats
on the eighth you went to moses to ask for advice
winged horned buraq the prophet's steed
returned as a lamb on the ninth
to graze on my belly fur
on the tenth you died for isaac
the angel decided in favor of animal testing
on the eleventh I had forgotten the color of your eyes
on the twelfth day you were poor and naked
on the thirteenth you were lying on the bottom of the sea
a millions of eons old whispering mussel
on the fourteenth they called you into the field
duldul, ali's tireless gray mule
on the fifteenth you stood still
welded on the lip of a kettle
the sweat of the holy brew had oxidized 
your copper neck
on the sixteenth you were the primordial ox
zarathustra sang of your suffering
on the seventeenth day when I came home
you were once again the one human being






The End of Marriage
 

Night was and they swayed into it:
a pair of scissors, of sails
turning only into themselves
more other than become.

It is often five o'clock.  
Her husband has contracted not 
to speak of her and she has forgotten 
where to go. Where does everyone go?






Itchy
 

             Hard to reach, so you yank your clothes
getting at it--the button at your neck,
the knotted shoe. You snake your fingers in
until your nails possess the patch of skin
that's eating you. And now you're in the throes
of ecstasy, eyes lolling in your skull, 
as if sensing the first time the joy one takes
                     in being purely animal.

             It's so good to have a scratch,
though isn't it a drag living like this,
jounced on a high wire of impulses,
every wish the same programmed response
to another signal passed from cell to cell,
amounting in the end to a distraction--
if truth be told--from rarer things, thoughts free
                     from the anchor-chain of self?

             For even the least sweetness, we
behave like the old man on the low wall
I saw outside the hospital today,
who had his hand inside his flannel shirt,
scratching at his chest, trancelike, agog,
his eyelids fluttering like butterflies
in a meadow of snowy Queen Anne's lace.
                     I never saw him stop.

             Such root satisfaction is like
the dying desert legionnaire's in films, 
when he finds, against all odds, a water jug  
and, lifting it, delights to feel it heavy.
The score swells, his eyes relume. He tugs 
the stopper out, then fills his mouth with sand.
Though, worse: we've seen the film; we know it's sand;
                     we gulp it anyway.





The Shadow
 

One spring day I saw
the shadow of a strawberry tree
lying on the moor
like a shy lamb asleep.

Its heart was far away,
suspended in the sky,
brown in a brown veil,
in the sun's eye. 

The shadow played in the wind,
moving there alone
to make the tree content.
Here and there it shone.

It knew no pain, no haste,
wanting only to feel morning,
then noon, then the slow-paced
journey of evening.

Among all the shadows always 
joining eternal shadow,
shrouding the earth in falseness,
I loved this steady shadow.

And thus, at times, it descends
among us, this meek semblance, 
and lies down, as if drained,
in grass and in patience.





Summer
 

And it grows, the vain 
summer,
even for us with our 
bright green sins:

behold the dry guest,
the wind,
as it stirs up quarrels
among magnolia boughs

and plays its serene
tune on
the prows of all the leaves--
and then is gone,

leaving the leaves 
still there,
the tree still green, but breaking
the heart of the air.





Little Diary of Getting Old: VIII
 

And then at night, when old, 
we start having vague pointless
scraps of dreams that lead us
to this place or that, since even
our failing senses insist on
outings: and lost friends reappear, 
sleepwalking through the stupor 
of surrendered existence.
But here too there's something
that's not unconscious, as when
the boatman stops his old ferry 
along the banks of the Arno, 
plunges his wooden bailer 
into the bottom of the boat, 
and dumps that stale water,
gone to grime between the staves,
overboard into the river,
where it flows again,
though the boat is held fast
amid the mud and rushes.

 






Fear of Happiness
 

Looking back, it's something I've always had:
As a kid, it was a glass-floored elevator
I crouched at the bottom of, my eyes squinched tight,
Or staircase whose gaps I was afraid I'd slip through,
Though someone always said I'd be all right--
Just don't look down or See, it's not so bad
(The nothing rising underfoot). Then later
The high-dive at the pool, the tree-house perch,
Ferris wheels, balconies, cliffs, a penthouse view,
The merest thought of airplanes. You can call
It a fear of heights, a horror of the deep;
But it isn't the unfathomable fall
That makes me giddy, makes my stomach lurch,
It's that the ledge itself invents the leap.






Fairy-tale Logic
 

Fairy tales are full of impossible tasks:
Gather the chin hairs of a man-eating goat,
Or cross a sulphuric lake in a leaky boat,
Select the prince from a row of identical masks,
Tiptoe up to a dragon where it basks
And snatch its bone; count dust specks, mote by mote,
Or learn the phone directory by rote.
Always it's impossible what someone asks--

You have to fight magic with magic. You have to believe
That you have something impossible up your sleeve,
The language of snakes, perhaps, an invisible cloak,
An army of ants at your beck, or a lethal joke,
The will to do whatever must be done:
Marry a monster. Hand over your firstborn son.






In Beauty Bright
 

In beauty-bright and such it was like Blake's 
lily and though an angel he looked absurd
dragging a lily out of a beauty-bright store
wrapped in tissue with a petal drooping,
nor was it useless--you who know it know
how useful it is--and how he would be dead
in a minute if he were to lose it though
how do you lose a lily? His lily was white
and he had a foolish smile there holding it up like
a candelabrum in his right hand facing the 
mirror in the hall nor had the endless
centuries started yet nor was there one thorn
between his small house and the beauty-bright store.





Journey
 

How dumb he was to wipe the blood from his eye
where he was sucker-punched and stagger out
onto the Plaza blind. He had been waiting
all night for the acorn moon and eating pineapple
topping over his ice cream and arguing
either physics or philosophy. He thinks,
at this late date, it was the cave again
throwing a shadow, although it may have been
only some way of reconciling the two 
oblivious worlds, which was his mission anyhow--
if only there was a second moon. He had a 
kind of beard and though he could practically lift
the front end of a car and was already
reading Blake, he had never yet tasted honey.






Natural State
 

I'm sitting at Nathan's, reading a biography of Darwin
who, right now, is dissecting a barnacle

"no bigger than a pinhead (and with two penises):
he'll work like this on barnacles, his wrists supported

by rigged-up blocks of workshop wood, for eight years.
Nathan is reading too, in the worn-down banged-up "daddy chair:

those philosophical poems of William Bronk's. What's
most delightful is that Tristan, eleven, and Aidan, ten,

are reading, each of them enmazed in a fantasy novel
that squeezes them by the attention-bone behind the eyes

in its thimble pool of pineal juice and drizzled endorphins.
Tristan cared enough to cry when he finished his previous book

and its battle of shadow and radiance was over.
Each of us: his individual book; and yet

the silence is communal. This is a natural state
at Nathan's. Holly, however, is reading the Sunday paper

and so serves, without saying a word, to remind us
how natural it was for Raeshawn Nelson, seven,

to fall while running and burn out his eye
on the disregarded meth pipe, or for Anna Rietta, nine,

to have come home from school and excitedly been 
the **!star!**, each day, of the homemade porn her parents

peddled as "young fun over the Internet. This
was what they knew, and all they knew, and so they entered it

as comfortably as Tristan does his opened world
of sorcerors and valiant knights and fancy-talking beasts, since use

x frequency = familiarity. That's the strict, imperious math
of everybody's insular subuniverse. Sherena asked me what

this thing "vermouth was (she pronounced it "mouth) and ordered
quiche as if it were the brother of "touch; but then

she needed to explain to me why C-C was the "bottom bitch
and what a "T-girl is and how to put down money

on Ice's book at "the county, by which
she meant jail. And those years when Darwin parsed

the slimy fiber of his barnacles (discovering the species
where "the female has no anus and the one with "tiny parasitic

males [that were] embedded in one female's flesh like blackheads),
"squinty . . . laborious, were among the final decades of hundreds of years

when a woman in China would suffer ritual foot binding,
at five, the bandages limiting growth until the toes

were bent and curled (the toenails growing into the balls of the feet)
and the arches broken. This resulted in the desirable

"shrunken plums and "three-inch golden lilies sought
by marriage brokers. Traditionally, a prospective mother-in-law

would check below the hem, and reject any feet
over four inches long. Entire generations of women could only 

mince and hobble. And this was natural, this was the air
and the light and "the-way-of-things-forever that

you woke up to every day . . . as natural as the implicit laws
in Aidan's book, by which a bear converses

with a girl in growly mutual-speak, and a boy
of sturdy heart and his wingd horse ascend

their sky with the unremarkable grace of birds
in ours. That's ordinary Newtonian physics there, and Aidan

subjects himself to the rules of flying horsemanship,
and the code of those of innocent spirit

about to war with wyverns and the wormfolk, and
the governing instructions of gods with the heads

of wide-eyed animals . . . and even now, Sherena texts
my phone to say that WEATHER GOOD and SHINE

GOT BULLET IN LUNG FROM POLICE, as if
these two reports were equally weighted. There's

that famous and charming anecdote in which Darwin's 
second son George is at the house of a playfriend,

looking around, and casually asks him
"Where does your father do his barnacles?






Often I Imagine the Earth
 

Often I imagine the earth 
through the eyes of the atoms we're made of--
atoms, peculiar
atoms everywhere--
no me, no you, no opinions,
no beginning, no middle, no end,
soaring together like those 
ancient Chinese birds
hatched miraculously with only one wing,
helping each other fly home.






To a Young Poet
 

Don't believe our outlines, forget them 
and begin from your own words. 
As if you are the first to write poetry 
or the last poet.

If you read our work, let it not be an extension of our airs, 
but to correct our errs 
in the book of agony.

Don't ask anyone: Who am I?
You know who your mother is.
As for your father, be your own.

Truth is white, write over it 
with a crow's ink.
Truth is black, write over it
with a mirage's light.

If you want to duel with a falcon
soar with the falcon.

If you fall in love with a woman, 
be the one, not she,
who desires his end.

Life is less alive than we think but we don't think
of the matter too much lest we hurt emotions' health.

If you ponder a rose for too long
you won't budge in a storm.

You are like me, but my abyss is clear. 
And you have roads whose secrets never end.
They descend and ascend, descend and ascend.

You might call the end of youth 
the maturity of talent
or wisdom. No doubt, it is wisdom,
the wisdom of a cool non-lyric.

One thousand birds in the hand
don't equal one bird that wears a tree.

A poem in a difficult time 
is beautiful flowers in a cemetery.

Example is not easy to attain
so be yourself and other than yourself 
behind the borders of echo.

Ardor has an expiration date with extended range.
So fill up with fervor for your heart's sake,
follow it before you reach your path.

Don't tell the beloved, you are I 
and I am you, say
the opposite of that: we are two guests
of an excess, fugitive cloud.

Deviate, with all your might, deviate from the rule.

Don't place two stars in one utterance
and place the marginal next to the essential 
to complete the rising rapture.

Don't believe the accuracy of our instructions. 
Believe only the caravan's trace.

A moral is as a bullet in its poet's heart 
a deadly wisdom.
Be strong as a bull when you're angry 
weak as an almond blossom 
when you love, and nothing, nothing 
when you serenade yourself in a closed room.

The road is long like an ancient poet's night: 
plains and hills, rivers and valleys.
Walk according to your dream's measure: either a lily
follows you or the gallows.

Your tasks are not what worry me about you.
I worry about you from those who dance 
over their children's graves,
and from the hidden cameras
in the singers' navels.

You won't disappoint me, 
if you distance yourself from others, and from me. 
What doesn't resemble me is more beautiful.

From now on, your only guardian is a neglected future.

Don't think, when you melt in sorrow 
like candle tears, of who will see you 
or follow your intuition's light.
Think of yourself: is this all of myself?

The poem is always incomplete, the butterflies make it whole.

No advice in love. It's experience.
No advice in poetry. It's talent.

And last but not least, Salaam.






The Stag at Eve
 

In my cries I don't cease (some dumb bird)
when from the swinging trees a stag at eve

comes prancing, body dappled by the shadows
of dripping leaves. It's fall, after all, when

the land undoes its lingerie laces
and stands naked for the dark wood, balding

plains, for parking lots slick with strange water, 
for hills growing lush in emptiness

and into this scene enters the stag, moon lunate 
and swinging on a tether of leather

scored then cured, from one just like him a year
earlier. Some dumb bird, I bid him hello

and goodbye in a shriek so lusty he
turns his expensive head just to curse me.






Crossroads in the Past
 

That night the wind stirred in the forsythia bushes,
but it was a wrong one, blowing in the wrong direction.
"That's silly. How can there be a wrong direction?
 It bloweth where it listeth,' as you know, just as we do
when we make love or do something else there are no rules for.

I tell you, something went wrong there a while back.
Just don't ask me what it was. Pretend I've dropped the subject.
No, now you've got me interested, I want to know
exactly what seems wrong to you, how something could

seem wrong to you. In what way do things get to be wrong?
I'm sitting here dialing my cellphone
with one hand, digging at some obscure pebbles with my shovel
with the other. And then something like braids will stand out,

on horsehair cushions. That armchair is really too lugubrious.
We've got to change all the furniture, fumigate the house,
talk our relationship back to its beginnings. Say, you know
that's probably what's wrong--the beginnings concept, I mean. 
I aver there are no beginnings, though there were perhaps some
sometime. We'd stopped, to look at the poster the movie theater

had placed freestanding on the sidewalk. The lobby cards
drew us in. It was afternoon, we found ourselves
sitting at the end of a row in the balcony; the theater was unexpectedly
crowded. That was the day we first realized we didn't fully
know our names, yours or mine, and we left quietly
amid the gray snow falling. Twilight had already set in. 






Anticipated Stranger,
 

the bruise will stop by later.
For now, the pain pauses in its round,
notes the time of day, the patient's temperature,
leaves a memo for the surrogate: What the hell
did you think you were doing? I mean . . .
Oh well, less said the better, they all say.
I'll post this at the desk.

God will find the pattern and break it.





Still Life in Landscape
 

It was night, it had rained, there were pieces of cars and
half-cars strewn, it was still, and bright,
a woman was lying on the highway, on her back,
with her head curled back and tucked under her shoulders
so the back of her head touched her spine
between her shoulder-blades, her clothes
mostly accidented off, and her 
leg gone, a long bone
sticking out of the stub of her thigh--
this was her her abandoned matter,
my mother grabbed my head and turned it and
clamped it into her chest, between
her breasts. My father was driving--not sober
but not in this accident, we'd approached it out of 
neutral twilight, broken glass
on wet black macadam, like an underlying
midnight abristle with stars. This was
the world--maybe the only one.
The dead woman was not the person
my father had recently almost run over,
who had suddenly leapt away from our family
car, jerking back from death,
she was not I, she was not my mother,
but maybe she was a model of the mortal,
the elements ranged around her on the tar--
glass, bone, metal, flesh, and the family.





First Thanksgiving
 

When she comes back, from college, I will see
the skin of her upper arms, cool,
matte, glossy. She will hug me, my old
soupy chest against her breasts,
I will smell her hair! She will sleep in this apartment,
her sleep like an untamed, good object,
like a soul in a body. She came into my life the
second great arrival, after him, fresh
from the other world--which lay, from within him,
within me. Those nights, I fed her to sleep,
week after week, the moon rising,
and setting, and waxing--whirling, over the months,
in a slow blur, around our planet.
Now she doesn't need love like that, she has
had it. She will walk in glowing, we will talk,
and then, when she's fast asleep, I'll exult
to have her in that room again,
behind that door! As a child, I caught
bees, by the wings, and held them, some seconds,
looked into their wild faces,
listened to them sing, then tossed them back
into the air--I remember the moment the 
arc of my toss swerved, and they entered
the corrected curve of their departure. 






Winter Stars
 

My father once broke a man's hand
Over the exhaust pipe of a John Deere tractor. The man,
Rubn Vsquez, wanted to kill his own father
With a sharpened fruit knife, & he held
The curved tip of it, lightly, between his first
Two fingers, so it could slash
Horizontally, & with surprising grace,
Across a throat. It was like a glinting beak in a hand,
And, for a moment, the light held still
On those vines. When it was over,
My father simply went in & ate lunch, & then, as always,
Lay alone in the dark, listening to music.
He never mentioned it.

I never understood how anyone could risk his life,
Then listen to Vivaldi.

Sometimes, I go out into this yard at night,
And stare through the wet branches of an oak
In winter, & realize I am looking at the stars
Again. A thin haze of them, shining
And persisting.

It used to make me feel lighter, looking up at them.
In California, that light was closer.
In a California no one will ever see again,
My father is beginning to die. Something
Inside him is slowly taking back
Every word it ever gave him.
Now, if we try to talk, I watch my father
Search for a lost syllable as if it might
Solve everything, & though he can't remember, now,
The word for it, he is ashamed . . .
If you can think of the mind as a place continually
Visited, a whole city placed behind
The eyes, & shining, I can imagine, now, its end--
As when the lights go off, one by one,
In a hotel at night, until at last
All of the travelers will be asleep, or until
Even the thin glow from the lobby is a kind
Of sleep; & while the woman behind the desk
Is applying more lacquer to her nails,
You can almost believe that the elevator,
As it ascends, must open upon starlight.

I stand out on the street, & do not go in.
That was our agreement, at my birth.

And for years I believed
That what went unsaid between us became empty,
And pure, like starlight, & that it persisted.

I got it all wrong.
I wound up believing in words the way a scientist
Believes in carbon, after death.

Tonight, I'm talking to you, father, although
It is quiet here in the Midwest, where a small wind,
The size of a wrist, wakes the cold again--
Which may be all that's left of you & me.

When I left home at seventeen, I left for good.

That pale haze of stars goes on & on,
Like laughter that has found a final, silent shape
On a black sky. It means everything
It cannot say. Look, it's empty out there, & cold.
Cold enough to reconcile
Even a father, even a son.





Bluetop
 

Her head bangs against the window
and dash when I stop and turn,
my legs too short to work
the brakes.
                 Mama's crooked
brow, her makeup smearing away,
slurs something about good
ol' boy music, a pint of Kentucky
Deluxe in her hand. Two hours,
she said, and three days later,
Tuesday, she is finally wanting
to stop. I am getting better
at the turns, guiding her
Cutlass through these hills,
ten miles an hour, gravel roads,
the Cutlass
                  rattling out the last
fumes of gas. Engine stops,
the night dimly lit by the moon
hung over the treetops;
owls calling each other from
hilltop to valley bend.
                               The radio
fades in and out of static,
tractors revving, cows lowing,
and we may never make it back,
home still five hills away, daylight
coming over rocky edges of the hills.






Mangled, Letters, and the Target Girl
 

Only to hoot, to speak flitting blade in the dark, mouth
able to sound verb for thing, him chicken eat. Not know
gallop but for sound, stud but for knotting haunches,
tipping its body, arching its head toward dirt. Chewing
hay under a ranch that, bean-juice skin tight as saddle
leather, neck stiff as a coffee can--as lanterns go out,
stud fed and tied to post--Mangled piles up some hay,
rests his bones for the long day of pounding tent stakes.

-- -- --

Ringmaster swigs moonshine from jar, stomps camp,
looking for LuLu's pudgy round face. Mangled wakes,
remembers the switching, musky soil, the stud's hooves
sucking mud, LuLu moaning in the night. Stock of spade,
thud of stakes drove in the dirt; the performers sagging
in their bones, their breath spent breaking in frost-thick
dawn, the trees swaying barer as the day wears on, wind
carrying the red and yellow leaves across the fields. After
the act, LuLu writes letters for Mangled, that he trots
stud into the show, bullwhip in one hand, bridle the other.

-- -- -- 

She did not write about a scar that runs down his cheek,
or the clown he stabbed near Tulsa. LuLu writes about
his new square-toed boots and the creased-up Levi's he
bought at a mercantile in Lawrence, Kansas. She writes
about his haircuts, how if he could, he would write letters
himself, but signed with his throwing hand. Sometimes she
reads him Westerns and Sgt. Rock comic books--she lies
about what the stories say--that his skillet face ain't so flat.

-- -- --

Him horse ride, LuLu throw with knife, fire cook meat. Him
audience laugh make, headdress wear. Him horse smell
snout, hooves scrape rock out, horse-apple chew hand.

-- -- --

Sundays LuLu and Mangled go to the Baptist church before the start
of the show. They sing hymns, sometimes they walk down
to the river with the congregation and watch the preacher dunk
the pudgy babies into the bright-sparked current, Mangled
thinks about the creek-bed soil, LuLu in her Sunday dress,
her face painted blush, lips bright, glossy, shined for the show.







The Robbery
 

Red ambulance flicker, curbstone, wheels, a gurney. Down the breezeway a baby, crying out among the gawk-mouthed heads.
Knifed, sliced, the man bleeding through the gauze and onto his belly.

It reminds me of the night when my mother and I slept in our LTD while the cops surrounded our apartment complex.
I remember someone standing near the yellow tape saying 2A had robbed the market across the street, that the manager was shot twice--
once in the arm, once in the shoulder--and that the gunmen were held up in their apartment, squealing threats from their window.

When I think of it now, the danger, the eventual gunshots echoing off gray brick, I remember the panicked yells of inquiry,
a girl crying her daddy was shot.

But the knifed man, now under gauze and tubing, hadn't robbed a store, and the baby, now on its mother's hip, was quiet and drooling.

When the cops searched 2A, they found money stuffed in the couches, in posts and
pans, in the pages of storybooks, and as each officer, one by one, emerged from the apartment holding pistols and rifles, my mother told me to go back to sleep.

I don't remember her carrying me to my bed, only waking the next day when the girl who cried daddy,
knocked at our door, asked if I could come out and play.

Now when I look at her, that same girl, with a busted eye and lip, I wonder: if when
she stabbed was she stabbing the boyfriend who beat her for burning supper or was
it her dad for wrenching his arm around her neck, prodding a pistol at her head on that balmy night of echo and threat.

For a second I think of asking her, "Whatever happened to your dad? Is he still in jail?

But I realize it may not even be the same girl, though I want it to be.

For some reason I think if she kills that man, if he bleeds to death before the ambulance can make it to the hospital,
somehow the brief triumph of metal over flesh would rid my memory of the deafening crack of gunpowder, and its long shout in the night.






Old Man Throwing a Ball
 

He is tight at first, stiff, stands there atilt 
tossing the green fluff tennis ball down 
the side alley, but soon he's limber, 
he's letting it fly and the black lab 
 
lops back each time. These are the true lovers, 
this dog, this man, and when the dog stops 
to pee, the old guy hurries him back, then 
hurls the ball farther away.  Now his mother 
 
dodders out, she's old as the sky, wheeling 
her green tank with its sweet vein, breath. 
She tips down the path he's made for her, 
grass rippling but trim, soft underfoot, 
 
to survey the yard, every inch of it 
in fine blossom, set-stone, pruned miniature, 
split rails docked along the front walk, 
antique watering cans down-spread--up 
 
huffs the dog again with his mouthy ball-- 
so flowers seem to spill out, red geraniums, 
grand blue asters, and something I have 
no name for, wild elsewhere in our world 
 
but here a thing to tend. To call for, and it comes. 







A Blessing for Wedding
 

Today when persimmons ripen
Today when fox-kits come out of their den into snow
Today when the spotted egg releases its wren song
Today when the maple sets down its red leaves
Today when windows keep their promise to open
Today when fire keeps its promise to warm
Today when someone you love has died
     or someone you never met has died
Today when someone you love has been born
     or someone you will not meet has been born
Today when rain leaps to the waiting of roots in their dryness
Today when starlight bends to the roofs of the hungry and tired
Today when someone sits long inside his last sorrow
Today when someone steps into the heat of her first embrace
Today, let this light bless you
With these friends let it bless you
With snow-scent and lavender bless you
Let the vow of this day keep itself wildly and wholly
Spoken and silent, surprise you inside your ears
Sleeping and waking, unfold itself inside your eyes
Let its fierceness and tenderness hold you
Let its vastness be undisguised in all your days
 





The Wealth of the Destitute
 

How gray and hard the brown feet of the wretched of the earth.
How confidently the crippled from birth
push themselves through the streets, deep in their lives.
How seamed with lines of fate the hands
of women who sit at streetcorners
offering seeds and flowers.
How lively their conversation together.
How much of death they know.
I am tired of the fine art of unhappiness.'





Psyche in Somerville
 

I am angry with X, with Y, with Z,
for not being you.
Enthusiasms jump at me,
wagging and barking. Go away.
Go home.

I am angry with my eyes for not seeing you,
they smart and ache and see the snow,
an insistent brilliance.

If I were Psyche how could I not
bring the lamp to our bedside?
I would have known in advance
all the travails my gazing
would bring, more than Psyche
ever imagined,
and even so, how could I not have raised
the amber flame to see
the human person I knew
was to be revealed.
She did not even know! She dreaded
a beast and discovered
a god. But I
know, and hunger
to witness again the form
of mortal love itself.

I am angry with everything that is filling
the space of your absence,
breathing your air.
                           Psyche,
how blessed you were
in the dark, knowing him in your flesh:
I was wrong! If I were Psyche
I would live on in darkness, and endure
the foolish voices, barking of aeolian dogs,
                                                             the desert glitter
of days full of boring treasures,
walking on precious stones till my feet hurt,

to hold you each night and be held
close in your warmth in a pitchblack cave of a room

and not have to wait
for Mercury, dressed in the sad gray coat of a mailman
and no wings on his feet,
to bring me your words.





What My House Would Be Like If It Were A Person
 

This person would be an animal.
This animal would be large, at least as large
as a workhorse. It would chew cud, like cows,
having several stomachs.
No one could follow it
into the dense brush to witness
its mating habits. Hidden by fur,
its sex would be hard to determine.
Definitely it would discourage
investigation. But it would be, if not teased,
a kind, amiable animal,
confiding as a chickadee. Its intelligence
would be of a high order,
neither human nor animal, elvish.
And it would purr, though of course,
it being a house, you would sit in its lap,
not it in yours.





Seventh Sunday
 

Since you were not Hume's sunrise
I watch the late-May moonrise alone

and a nicotine trance assures me
that summer is coming, and the arrival

of painted toenails; that at last
I truly understand aubades

and James Stewart's vacant hospital gaze
after his wits have vanished with his love;

that the transmigration of bruises
from skin to spirit brings about

such splendid depths of character
you'll drop a dime and never hear a sound.

Clouds race across the moon's pale face.
I have character to spare, it is

no comfort; I will write us down,
making nothing happen, it won't repair

this ache of failed induction, these eye
that live for sunlight, though the sky stays dark.





After Eden
 

Somewhere Zeno was smiling, the foul
goblins of paradox were wearing
their fairest clothes that night. My Dinner
with a Chainsaw, the evening could have
been called; and when one too many led
to wise judgements too few, "I'm trying
to break up with you! he shouted as
stockings and scruples flew; and what was 
over wasn't; the brutal doings
were sweeter than a caress; the thrill
of it happening and the horror
of it being an awful mistake
collided like sweaty bodies in
the dark, disheveled room. So this is
moving on, she reflected after
he left. But what was motion? No straight
bright line but a wind every bit as
stormy as the people it carried
away from safety, through towns that froze
and burned, helping them forward but not
letting them forget for a second
their ceaseless looking for what is lost,
their sad resemblance to the quick and 
stubborn arrows that never arrive.





Love and Work
 

In an uncurtained room across the way
a woman in a tight dress paints her lips
a deeper red, and sizes up her hips
for signs of ounces gained since yesterday.

She has a thoughtful and a clever face,
but she is also smart enough to know
the truth: however large the brain may grow,
the lashes and the earrings must keep pace.

Although I've spread my books in front of me
with a majestic air of I'll show her,
I'm much less confident than I'd prefer,
and now I've started pacing nervously.

I'm poring over theorems, tomes and tracts.
I'm getting ready for a heavy date
by staying up ridiculously late.
But a small voice advises, Face the facts:

go on this way and you'll soon come to harm.
The world's most famous scholars wander down
the most appalling alleyways in town,
a blond and busty airhead on each arm.

There is an inner motor known as lust
that makes a man of learning walk a mile
to gratify his raging senses, while
the woman he can talk to gathers dust.

A chilling vision of the years ahead
invades my thoughts, and widens like a stain:
a barren dance card and a teeming brain,
a crowded bookcase and an empty bed...

What if I compromised? I'd stay up late
to hone my elocutionary skills,
and at the crack of dawn I'd swallow pills
to calm my temper and control my weight,

but I just can't. Romantics, so far gone
they think their lovers live for wisdom, woo
by growing wiser; when I think of you
I find the nearest lamp and turn it on.

Great gods of longing, watch me as I work
and if I sprout a martyr's smarmy grin
please find some violent way to do me in;
I'm burning all these candles not to shirk

a night of passion, but to give that night
a richly textured backdrop when it comes.
The girl who gets up from her desk and dumbs
her discourse down has never seen the flight

of wide-eyed starlings from their shabby cage;
the fool whose love is truest is the one
who knows a lover's work is never done.
I'll call you when I've finished one more page.





Short Ode to Screwball Women
 

On sullen nights like these
when my spirit counts its woes like pearls on a string,
you bring me armfuls of spare pantsuits
and clear-eyed hints about the woman
who might kick up her heels in them, flooding rooms
with cunning, air, an almost gaudy vitality.

Gaudy but sober: when your wayward husband
courted the heiress, you stormed her gates
disguised as a floozy--and asked the butler
to serve you gingerale. It was life
you'd rather be drunk on, roaring life
that told you there is no time for spirits
of dark staircases, only lightning ruses
that not only leave no bruises but give
all parties their wish: rinsed vision and second chances.

Losing a boot heel and giddily claiming
I was born on the side of a hill is easy.
For every such moment there are ten
when my ideal snags midflight, a bag caught in branches.
But a girl can dream, can realize, high
on heroines, that she is mortal
and therefore fearless; that sanity
supplies the ground bass to the wildest singing;
that breezes made visible make the finest winds.





Blue Octavo Haiku
 

after Kafka

In fat armchairs sat
indolence and impatience,
plotting my downfall

      *

A wicked cage flew
across the long horizon
searching for a bird.

      *

I burned with love in
empty rooms, I sternly turned
knives within myself.

      *

"Behold the bright gate,
the keeper said. "I am now
going to shut it.

      *

Hardly was the road
swept clean when ah! there appeared
new piles of dry leaves.

      *

But nothing could kill
a faith like a guillotine,
as heavy, as light.

      *

Happiness? Finding
your indestructible core;
leaving it alone.

      *

Into the heavens
flew a breathless legion of
impossible crows.





I was Wash-Way in Blood
 

The Barbados Advocate, Thursday, January 19, 1995, page 4

MILDRED COLLYMORE told the No. 3 Supreme Court yesterday that when she recovered from an attack with a stone she found herself "washed-way" in blood.Collymore said also that accused Philamena Hinds came back to move the rock but she would not let her.The complainant said that on the day of the incident she left her home and went over to her daughter's on the other side of the road to cut the grass from around the place. When she got to the spot she said dirt was on the grass and she took the hoe and raked it away.While she was doing this, the witness said, Hinds' son, Gline, came and spoke to her and then went back up the road. She said Hinds came next and spoke to her but she did not hear what she said.The witness added that she was holding down, and on looking up she was struck suddenly with a big rock in her right forehead."I tumble down and when I come to myself I was wash-way in blood." she testified...Collymore told the court [that] after she found out she was bleeding she went to a neighbour's home and called the police.She was later taken to   the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and detained for three days, she saidAsked by prosecutor Ms Donna Babb if she had quarrelled with   Collymore before the incident she replied no. The witness also told the prosecutor that  she did not interfere with the accused.

Babb asked her if she had attacked the accused with a hoe but she said she was not given a chance to do so.
Cross-examine
When defence lawyer Dr Waldo Waldron Ramsey's turn came to cross-examine Collymore, he asked her how long she knew the accused and she said it was since childhood. She also said she and Hinds once worked together in they understand each other.Waldron-Ramsay suggested to the witness that on the day of the incident, marl was on the accused woman's property and she was pulling it down to make a road for her daughter and son-in-law.She denied the suggestion.He further told Hinds that she told the accused that she cold not stop her from pulling down the marl, and this she denied.Waldron-Ramsay put it to the witness that when she refused to stop moving the marl the accused left her and went back home, but Hinds said this was not < true.Continuing his cross-examination, Waldron-Ramsay suggested to Hinds that Collymore came to her a second time and told her to stop racking away her dirt but the witness [the accused!] again denied this ever took place.The witness further denied the suggestion that this second time she became more vicious and told the accused [Hinds] that if she did not move her                      "X X X X               she would lick her to                       X X X X                        down."Waldron-Ramsay also suggested to Collymore that she had the hoe in the air ready to lick down Hinds, but she denied this.

 DATE TREE HILL CASE
The crown will call its third witness this morning in the trial of 48-year-old Philamena Hinds, before Mr Justice Frederick Waterman in No. 3 Supreme Court.Hinds, a machine operator, of Date Tree Hill, St Peter, is charged with causing grievous bodily harm to 65-year-old Mildred Collymore, of Date Tree Hill, on December 13, 1993, with intent to maim, disfigure or disable her...Hinds, who pleaded not guilty... is represented by attorney-at-law Dr. Waldo Waldron Ramsay while the Crown's case is being put by Acting Crown Counsel Donna Babb.Collymore's 45-year-old-daughter, Linda, is acting as her interpreter, because the witness has a hearing problem.
 






Or Death and December
 

The Roman Catholic bells of Princeton, New Jersey,
wake me from rousing dreams into a resounding hangover.
Sweet Jesus, my life is hateful to me.
Seven a.m. and time to walk my dog on a leash.

Ice on the sidewalk and in the gutters,
and the wind comes down our one-way street
like a deuce-and-a-half, a six-by, a semi,
huge with a cold load of growls.

There's not only leaf left to bear witness,
with twitch and scuttle, rattle and rasp,
against the blatant roaring of the wrongway wind.
Only my nose running and my face frozen

into a kind of grin which has nothing to do
with the ice and the wind or death and December,
but joy pure and simple when my black and tan puppy,
for the first time ever, lifts his hind leg to pee.





Mined
 

you hardly wait for a chink
to open where something to say
might issue, and not more blue
smoke. the heart is a small
red pyramid, totally relaxed
you put your finger on a map of
the Balearic Islands, orange 
as ironwood & what a strange day
comes out of you like bluets
it doesn't matter what you say
the ruins stand in a green shade
tall, taller than Odysseus
serving up his baseless dish
and around the yellow taxicabs
go, exhausted with the age
they are smashing your mind
purple, a Phoenician sea


          *


a cold boned idiot, she sang
make me young before I'm old
the heart is a stomped out place
and I'm gonna let it shine
I'm not here to kiss your ass
or benefit from the lot cause
Baudelaire's one eye tricks
us all social freeing leaders
on packets of exotics, flesh
withdrawn from the collection
I counted twenty goof balls
standing around in their hose
a godawful business chant
you went to sea, captured live
on imperial destroyers
they wanted to erase this song
or maybe you just forgot


          *


stuck in the domestic blind zone
getting it on, legless and pale
Susan murmured down her breath
this is the sound of plaster and hills
marching through a void like ocean
a knob with no way of knowing
if it's tuned to redwing or swift
this is the look of an old gold ring
embattled, barebacked and elegant
the love bullet your future squeezed off
never explosive, clocked and tender
as a last night on the Caspian sea
this is the taste of a stunted youth
the sprig of parsley in your teeth
like a hairpiece or a question
curling up between the sheets
Susan sang and turned it to dust

as hyperbolic as a trumpet
or just chanting the rain away
Jennifer kept stretching
I was scared. spoke with a Cuban
at the laundromat, who knew
or said he did, how to fix
the backwards flow of time
the incompatible logics
daunting as before and after
so help me Kipling, I got
a cheap ticket for Cancun.

in two, sheltered a hurricane

to the tune of Gospel Four

May green in the vein, her boots
not marble but inflamed in a pattern
got from Garth Brooks, pierced me
freeze framed or medusa'd
I hit back hard. bits of sunlight
were ripping through the air
I concentrated on the pebbles
oak leaves like spaghetti catchers
were dancing, no handles. I
stared straight into the sun
avoiding the subject, for hours
neither original nor spelled
backwards as in tulip opening
up to let the grubs in, her hat
satisfied but medieval was a dare
from another world, yes
if I could, to spit out the sum

I don't see any hope
year after year, another ergot
epidemic in the colonies
if you remember me, spurned
by the worldly vanities
in an elegant but weather-
beaten frame unlike Priam
I had no orifices. this is sick.
all men are entertainment.
sometime after that, I was
in the colonies, & I got sick.
do they say the bought stem
poking its way through the holes

more of a wistful Fenollosa
after all, in her radiant gesture
obsessed with dolls, flouro fishbait
worms and bingo pieces
Susan sort of crept up on me
with leaves between spread fingers
I conjured the images she'd adjusted
the amphora of a squirrel's tail
the wailing of a gnat, a juiced
up version of the Africans
untroubled by impasto, her biography
would include a history of colors
nails, she conceded, were gutsy
but imperfect in this age of plastics
the spewed and shredded earth
hung about her ears, with one foot
she typed the word sardonic

attention shoppers, when I eat
I am filled with tenderness
my breath is lukewarm w/ pease
or lentil dust, what will you wear
when you take me to the disco
viscosed, a husky staple in your nose
on the thruway inventing rhymes
as a thin wine, mostly rusted
bursts vesicles in the Aesop's fable
of your throat. my chateau
a fifties throwback, with common
lines and a cambered outhouse
fails to please. if anything
it's significant as it crumbles:
the British consulate donates these
bedbugs to the next resident
alien or ancient, a vocal matzoh


          *


to this world of trash and plastic
the squirrel in a window light
on the wall, in blue velvet jumpers
was singing "Tu veras, a song
planted on my face like stalks
of an eye in the brain, fine vertical
webs sailing through the day
shavings inside of a brittle ear,
in the wine cellar the radio's static
reaches in to pierce the gloom
forcing imminent shadows, some
lively & positive throbbing
Paris, you forget the little lamb
gamely poised upon the stair
in the quivering darkness of trees
where you strike, hypothetical
as sunrise, running across cables


          *


the coal era which is ending
shits on our little civic duties
collides in the brain pan
with the rising middle class
I took the track I found
in chateaus and vagrant tunnels
& built my house, underneath
rushing onwards to get wet
decently, a primal terror originating
in the changes of the lovers
my heart hangs between, a blue
frame on an ecstatic haze
belched in lungfulls, and stacks
that leave a film of sparkle
on your sleeping, I enter quietly
& turn on a faucet could
see the future and that's scary






Crickets
 

wire not to be of waves

come           hear           me

the ardent ending
monarch's ardor began
a large wedge-shaped
cloud in the spring
thousands were taking
a fluent thoughtful nap
re nocturne, alone
all of them witch-doctors
or in a Chinese dream
woken-up philosophers
the single golden rule
overarches, ark or pendant
limpidity of clouds

overlord my monarch
the length of two thumbs
light fills the windows
clings to sun struts
grows outward, leafing
monarch emerges steeled
blood jams into wings
all that tickling insect
clasped to cock's fuzz
is a trance, inside syrups
a poison swapped about
bitter-tasting heart's
spasm, an orange avoid

a million pages turning
the library of spring
spotted with shadows
the piteous monarch
propagates, replenishes
ejaculates homeward
to completion in summer
the monarch's a cloud 
woven of monarchs, one
leaf journey's length
pulsating on, from ghosts
and milkweed deposits
a universe of monarchs

lazy winter monarch
on a warm day ventures
out for nectar, rubber
in the saps & rough stems
loves the poisoned milky
fields, sleepy his "eyes
open above the coccyx
looking for black-smudged
veiny queens, wooed
by the harmfully harmless
lauzengiers, wing deep
slips between sign & referent
are not what they seem

monarch's no mimic
no midas, this goldfeeler
melts you to the ore
nympho or mendicant
exasperating progress
discovered by millions
with wing covered sexes
gets sticky all over
in Zitacuaro it's quiet
piteous monarch, go
roving, unfolding, trees
branched into flames
would that you lasted







Arthrocereus Spinosissimus
 

frequents an area thousands of miles
from its generally accepted habitat
feeds on slave wages, & crystalline
grasp of the worth of each individual

is sick of growing between rocks
wants to articulate and flex carapace
numb with apparent survival

or to hop about the lawn pecking
bird-witted, on sissy little brother
arthritic serious and bristling candle

Id Like to See It
 

A compendium of words was stored here
Just underneath the chimney
I'd like to see it that way
Fortune won't stand still for that
And pressure of the air flattens paper
I'd like to see it that way
One comes into the room groomed, a pleasure
There's a patch of glitter in the glamor
I'd like to see it that way
Each moment opens up sudden as an umbrella
On a day storms gather like wool
A way I'd really like to see it
So you can't assume a face again
Before the non-face puts in its appearance
Nor can you push at the door expecting satisfaction on the other side
I'd like to see it that way
Many's the time and time for reflection
Truer than truth the subject's interconnections
I'd like to see it that way
I was born on a day absolutely unique in world history
Birds grasp their path in air
I'd like to see it that way
It's standard to pack half a dozen at a clip
Imagine the red thing yours alone at last
I'd like to see it that way
The image almost takes shape superimposed
As a mist on top of ordinary daily objects
I'd like to see it that way
Life goes on forever like a dusty road
Down which we peer as we drink a glass of water
I'd like to see it that way
We return again and again born into wombs
The shape of inverted ice cream cones
I'd like to see it that way
So I could relax, put on my enormous suit
And ring your doorbell holding my breath and flowers
I'd like to see it that way
In order to be able to end war but
Would war ever end or would my wanting 
To end it ever end if nothing ever ended
I'd like to see it that way
Everything is standing up and falling down again
Constantly like hair in wind
I'd like to see it that way
For the good of the nation behind bars
For my own good bundled up into piles
I'd like to see it that way
I blow continuously on this thing the landscape
Crumples around me like a felt hat
I'd like to see it that way
But the problem is I put out my hand
And only clutch air wanting to understand
I'd like to see it some way
Any way so long as I could know it was there
And could pull back the covers at will
To reveal my heart's desire and measure it
I'd like to see it that way





Last on Earth
 

It is said that many have been cured of madness by drinking
of the spring in the orchard of this convent, but I
doubt it, for it is a very pleasant place and a surfeit
of pleasantries often leads directly to madness.
I do not have much experience of madness (once
a sister ran naked down the hall) but I have tasted
the water and it is clear and fresh, there is nothing
unpleasant about it. The Abbess said of a certain man
he is a drink of water--meaning he was a bore--
but I want to meet that man, he would be as welcome
in my life as Jesus in the orchard here, though the fat
old Abbess might shoo him away.  I would be so glad
to have him drink, to serve him with a round of little glasses
on a painted tray, like the cocktail parties'
in the secular world, and I the hostess, turing her cheek
to be kissed in the fray. I would wear white clothes and
my headdress, and he might carry a scythe and cut
the morning glories, or simply sit and sun his nose.
But they have taken my Lord away, lodged Him in the earth
somewhere, call Him leaves, vines, breeze, bird.
It cannot be true. Looking for Him in these things
condemns us to a lifetime of imbecile activity.
He has a face, arms, legs, a navel. He is a man,
for He is everything I am not. How can it be
otherwise? Before I leave the spring. I lean
over it and weep. I spit upon the flowers. I stumble
up the hill. We are somewhere below the Tserna Gota--
meaning the Black Mountain--and when I reach the top
I count the villages--there are two--where we
are the last on earth to think of Him as having a head.
Here, too, is the source of the spring, and crows
with lethargic dispositions circle and circle the spot.






Four Anecdotes From the Life of Dang Yo-une
 

                           I
He stood outside the gates of Lhasa for four days
singing I fall upon the thorns of life,
I bleed, but the berries are delicious
if you remember to wash them.

                           II
The surface of his coca-cola sparkled so--
atoms of joy leapt from it like salmon in mid-stream!
He drank, then wiped the fish off his lips.

                           III
Wearing the pussy white suit of an astronaut
he tried to mount his horse
who pushed him baroquely
till he fell rococo and lanced.

                           IV
Innumerable horses race insanely
into the peak of battle
unaware Admiral van Euckhuysen is a tulip.
Dang, too, pretended he was a cat
and buried a bone.





Blood Soup
 

The last time I saw father alive he was using
a black umbrella, closed, to beat off some pigeons
hanging outside the marble portals of a museum.
We were visitors, walking very slowly, so father
could stoop and examine everything. We had not been
in the museum, but were resting on its steps.
We saw it all--the fountains, the statues, the parks
and the post office. Cities are made of such things.
Once we encountered a wedding coming out of the cathedral
and were caught in a shower of rice; as the bride
flicked her veiled head father licked his little finger
and in this way saved a grain. On the next block
he announced he was going to heaven. But first let's
go back to the hotel and rest, he said: I want my mint.
Those were practically his last words. And what did I want
more than anything in the world? Probably the ancient Polish
recipe for blood soup, which was finally told to me
in an empty deli in a deserted mill town in western Massachusetts
by the owner's mother, who was alone one day when I burst
in and demanded a bowl. But, she said, lacing her fingers
around a jar of morello cherries, it requires one cup of
new blood drawn from the goose whose neck you've just wrung
to put in the pot, and where in these days can I find
anything as fresh as that? I had lost track of my life
before, but nothing prepared me for the onslaught of
wayfarer's bliss when she continued to list, one
by one, the impossible ingredients I needed to live.
We sat at the greasy table far into the night, while
snow fell on the locked doors of the church next door,
dedicated to St. Stanislas, which was rumored to be
beautiful inside, and contain the remains of his beloved head.






Rain Effect
 

A bride and a groom sitting in an open buggy
in the rain, holding hands but not looking
at each other, waiting for the rain to stop,
waiting for the marriage to begin, embarrassed
by the rain, the effect of the rain on the bridal
veil, the wet horse with his mane in his eyes,
the rain cold as the sea, the sea deep as love,
big drops of rain falling on the leather seat,
the rain beaded on a rose pinned to the groom's 
lapel, the rain on the bride's bouquet,
on the baby's breath there, the sound of the rain
hitting the driver's top hat, the rain
shining like satin on the black street,
on the tips of patent leather shoes, Hokusai's
father who polished mirrors for a living, Hokusai's
father watching the sky for clouds, Hokusai's father's son
drawing rain over a bridge and over the people crossing
the bridge, Hokusai's father's son drawing the rain
for hours, Hokusai's father rubbing a mirror, the rain
cold as the sea, the sea cold as love, the sea swelling
to a tidal wave, at the tip of the wave white.





Illumination
 

The irresistible and benevolent light
brushes through the angel-wing begonias,
the clippings of ruddy ears for the living room.
Intimate motes, debris of grounded, forlorn walks,
speckle through the vitreous quality of blush.
As fluid lulls turn like trout backs, azure-tipped fins
oscillate in the shallows, the clear floating
is dizziness.

Tender events are meeting halves and wholes of affinity,
the recurrence of whimsy and parallel streams
flush away the blockage of malaise.
Incessant gratitude, pliable kindness smolders
in the husk of these sweet accumulations:
abalone shells, the thoughtful carvings from friends,
the stone of another's pocket, the photo of mystified 
moon over water, the smiles of worn chairs.

Austere hopes find pleasure in lately cherished flowers.
The blooms are articulate deluge, hues of delicacy.
Petals parted dim renderings, the viable imprint
of the blood-hot beam of light with reformed courage.
Beveling the finish to suppression, the blade of choice 
brings the flourish of dividing while adequately doubling
worth by two. Multiplying. The luminescent burning of space.
The heat is a domicile as abandoned as red roses budding
their ascension from stem.

The sun has its own drum contenting itself with the rose
heart it takes into continual rumbling. The connection
of surface and hand. The great head of dark clouds finds 
its own place of unraveled repercussions and disruption,
elsewhere, over the tall, staunch mountains of indemnity.






Home and the Homeless
 

The buildings are worn.
The trees are strong and ancient.
They bend against the grid of electric lines.
The windows are broken
by the homeless and the cold past.
I am home on the yard
that spreads mint, pales the Victorian roses,
takes into it the ravaged lilac tree.
The black bulk of plastic lies about
stopping unwanted weeds for the Landlord.
Tattered, the cedar tree is chipped to dry heaps of recklessness.
The unwanted spreads by the power of neglect.
The wear of traffic says that we are out of time,
must hurry.

Age, the creak in the handmade screen door fades behind itself.






Girlfriends
 

Filled with old lovers, in the clutch of the chair,
you are a bloom of uncombed hair.

With a collection of roses, bowls of mashed petals,
I make a clear cup of sky.
Fold away clouds. Roll up blankets of blue.
I am a body of empty husks.
Indian corn is in your hair, the tassels,
the pollen, fertility. 

Indelible ink is tattooing our lungs.
We speak smoke.
We exchange our lunacy for reverence.
Respect tornados.
Windy Woman. Four Winds.

We have extended the edge of expectation
by merely living.

You have tallied compulsion
into currency.

I am measured by the excitement
my lips stir.
I am the bin for castoffs and the weary.
I wear my veil.
I have no children,
but you have many.
You dream of heaven and they all run up to meet you.






My Brother
 

It was bruise marks of hands that alluded to tracks of murder.
Her neck was twisted too many times in short rope,
and the tree too high for a small woman.

"He was here. He says,
"He came to her new Man,
too, and said that he was coming for him next.

The nightmare is black tongue.
No footprints.
The form in the room
laughs, "Ha Ha, Goody!
He sees that it is vapor.

Later, when he cuts her down,
he knows that she came to him,
to him, she laughed.
The night will not make her unhappy.

He had no time to hunt,
since he had to bury
three more brothers the next day.
Car wreck on ice.

The insidious soul danced across the river
to entice other women to death.

If he is man,
he is subject to will.
If one prefers Archangels,
he can be cast into oblivion.

That does not comfort the people
and we must battle
with Bell and Prayer, for the brother.
This will take up the nights
and the rest of our thoughts. 
The brother has seen the foreshadowing of events.
He will bring the damned down in his fisherman's grip
into the mad boil of the river's strength.






In Oklahoma
 

          
          When you leave a Real City, as Gertrude Stein did, and go to Oakland, as she did, you can say, as she did, there is no there, there. When you are a Hartford insurance executive, as Wallace Stevens was, and you have never been to Oklahoma, as he had not, you can invent people to dance there, as he did, and you can name them Bonnie and Josie. But a THERE depends on how, in the beginning, the wind breathes upon its surface. Shh: amethyst, sapphire. Lead. Crystal mirror. See, a cow-pond in Oklahoma. Under willows now, so the Osage man fishing there is in the shade. A bobwhite whistles from his fencepost, a hundred yards south of the pond. A muskrat-head draws a nest of Vs up to the pond's apex, loses them there in the reeds and sedges where a redwing blackbird, with gold and scarlet epaulets flashing, perches on the jiggly buttonwood branch. Purple martins skim the pond, dip and sip, veer and swoop, check, pounce, crisscross each other's flashing paths. His wife in the Indian Hospital with cancer. Children in various unhappiness. White clouds sail slowly across the pure blue pond. Turtles poke their heads up, watch the Indian man casting, reeling, casting, reeling. A bass strikes, is hooked, fights, is reeled in, pulls away again, is drawn back, dragged ashore, put on the stringer. In Oklahoma, Wally, here is Josie's father. Something that is going to be nothing, but isn't. Watch: now he takes the bass home, cleans and fries it. Shall I tell you a secret, Gert? You have to be there before it's there. Daddy, would you pass them a plate of fish? See friends, it's not a flyover here. Come down from your planes and you'll understand. Here.
        




North of Santa Monica
 

It's midnight in a drizzling fog
on Sunset Avenue and we are walking
through the scent of orange blossoms and past
a white camellia blown down or flung by someone
onto rainblack asphalt waiting
for the gray Mercedes sedan to run over
and smash its petals and leave us walking in
the smell of Diesel exhaust with
orange-blossom bouquet.

Where the next blue morning
and the gray Pacific meet
as the Palisades fall away
two sparrowhawks are beating
their tapered wings in place, watching
for jay or chewink to stray too far
from their thorny scrub to get back--
and the female suddenly towers,
her wings half-close and she stoops like
a dropping dagger, but down
the steep slope she rockets past them and turns
again into updraft to the clifftops to hover--
as the jay peers out through thorns,
                             and the lines of white surf whisper in.






Statement on Energy Policy
 

It's true we have invented quark-extraction,
and this allows our aiming gravity at will;
it's true also that time
can now be made to flow
backward or forward by

the same process. It may be true as well that
what is happening at the focal point,
the meristem of this process,
creates a future kind of space,
a tiny universe that has

quite different rules. In this, it seems,
whatever one may choose to do or be becomes
at once the case. In short,
we have discovered heaven and
it's in our grasp. However,

the Patent Office has not yet approved and cites
less positive aspects of this invention. First, it
does not generate profit, and
it does make obsolete all present 
delivery systems for our nukes. Then,

it will let private citizens do things that only
a chosen few, that is, OUR sort, should be allowed--
fly freely from one country
to any other, spreading diseases
and bankrupting transportation.

Home-heating, auto-making industries will be trashed,
employment shelled, depressions spread worldwide,
sheer anarchy descend.
For these and other reasons,
no one must know of this. . . .






Turning
 

The song is Gaelic now,
peridot words
the color of fresh
timothy gathered
by red-haired women;
or the song 
is the bony white oak
and rhythm of Miwu,
a knowing that breathes
against angles of granite
and meets the ground
in a flurry of sound.
Or the song rides down from a star
over burgundy boulders
beneath a dazzling blue sky
to find the old words
buried deep in the earth.

But this heart listens.
This song. Hi-tsah-tsi-nah,
the precious rain awakening.

On this you come
as a prayer in the flesh,
on this you ride
with the roll and rollick
of rattlesnake.
On this you sing
volcanic birthing words
and obsidian cools where
the blood bubbles down.

          Oh look, a little girl is lost
          although she stands close
          to her mother's heart.
          With great energy she scrapes
          the missionaries from her ribs.
          Shoulder blades curve
          around the spine
          and the pestle dances,
          acorns flying,
          and dust collects
          in the creases
          of her hands. Or

     she is kneeling in a small room
     at the edge of the mesa,
     polished black bone of earth,
     cherished piki stone,
     moving back and forth
     this act of love, grinding
     the corn until it is dark,
     brushing the white cornmeal
     into one basket, the blue
     into another, thinking already
     of the daughters she will bear
     glowing in the sun.

Or she is standing at the bog
inside a mountain meadow,
hands raised up to tie back her hair
with a thin red rag; seeds loosen
and cling to her shoes, her stockings,
her long skirt, her skin.
She fearlessly walks
through gold fiddleneck,
small mountain lupines, clouds
of white popcorn flowers fallen upward
out of the ground
to cover the hillside
like snow. Or
          a woman gathers loop after loop
          of heavy rope to guide the head
          of the horse she straddles and sometimes
          she is the mare and the soft sandstone
          and the hot rocks rolling in acorn soup,
          trying to heal the gash spread across her path
          where the crescent moon has sliced the earth.
          Ocean to mountain to mesa, the bundle she carries
          is a sacred memory, a rainbow that arches
          from one side of the sky to the other.

Or a woman is closing
a steamer trunk, has to sit on it hard
to get the latch through and
the leather buckled; seagulls dive
outside the wall of the ship, she
hears their demands, maybe one
has come inside to brush her cheek
with its pointed wing or maybe
just another tear warmed by cooling blood.

How she aches in the cold, she is so thin;
and when she pulls the blanket around her
and lies down on the floor, she is no more
than a pile of old rags, a few sticks of firewood,
a broken broom. Steady against the roll of the sea
she is patient as the rocks that wait for the ship
along a northern corridor, angry as the storms
midway across the Atlantic that shake their fists
at those who must leave home, and as deeply hidden
as the icebergs that threaten to disembowl.
She has already seen the world dissolve;
now she feels the breaking
of one last thread
to ancestral land,
feels the very break
of it.






International Hour of Prayer for the Yellowstone Buffalo Herd
 

Noon, March 6, 1997
From morning's mouth
the bones emerge,
a prayer is whispered
over rounded horns;
the prairie is beyond
the quivering hump
and holy smoke sparkles
released in the breath.
Braided sweetgrass,
be about their hooves;
although the grip of hunger
lies heavy on the land,
let endless native grasses grow
among the yellow stones
and between the stars. 
Even if only one man had 
begun to sing, actually
it was thousands, She who came
to Wisconsin farmers
and transformed their lives,
She who brought her blessing
in the form of being newborn,
She whom they named the Miracle,
White Buffalo Calf Maiden must return
amid the fast firing of bullets, along
the most perilous of paths. Rock stars,
millionaires, they all offered millions of dollars
to struggling white farmers
but she had begun her transformation and her prophecy
by touching them and they came to understand
if not the actual words to the prayers
at least the reverence, the need
to protect, to keep the doors open.
Like it was a hundred years ago
bounties are gathered from death;
trains, buses, cars, planes
carry the segmented body of the terrible worm
across the land and the screams of the hunted
split the sun awake. It is time to restore
the stolen beads and shards,
the bones and knives to every grave.
And the graves are graves no longer but wombs;
the bounties burn their hands
and bones come flowing
from museum shelves
to dance in the rippling grass,
rebuilding lungs, starting hearts.
                                              There must be a hundred men
                                              and a hundred men's worth
                                              of heartlessness; wished they could find
                                              Indians to kill but now that is illegal
                                              so they make up some excuse
                                              to raise their rifles and take aim,
                                              not hearing the rumble
                                              of buffalo prayer, not feeling
                                              tomorrow tremble
                                              or the prophecy of Miracle,
                                              and smile as they see the legs give way,
                                              the horns gouge open the prairie ground,
                                              Earth betrayed again.






Women Like Me
 

making promises they can't keep.
For you, Grandmother, I said I would pull
each invading burr and thistle from your skin,
cut out the dizzy brittle eucalypt,
take from the ground the dark oily poison
all to restore you happy and proud,
the whole of you transformed
and bursting into tomorrow.
           But where do I cut first?
Where should I begin to pull?
Should it be the Russian thistle
down the hill where backhoes
have bitten? Or African senecio
or tumbleweed bouncing
above the wind? Or the middle finger
of my right hand? Or my left eye
or the other one? Or a slice 
from the small of my back, a slab of fat
from my thigh? I am broken
as much as any native ground,
my roots tap a thousand migrations.
My daughters were never born, I am
as much the invader as the native,
as much the last day of life as the first.
I presumed you to be as bitter as me,
to tremble and rage against alien weight.
Who should blossom? Who should receive pollen?
Who should be rooted, who pruned,
who watered, who picked?
Should I feed the white-faced cattle
who wait for the death train to come
or comb the wild seeds from their tails?
Who should return across the sea
or the Bering Strait or the world before this one
or the Mother Ground? Who should go screaming
to some other planet, burn up or melt
in a distant sun? Who should be healed
and who hurt? Who should dry
under summer's white sky, who should shrivel
at the first sign of drought? Who should be remembered?
Who should be the sterile chimera of earth and of another place,
alien with a native face,
native with an alien face?






Buckeye as You Are
 

September 11, 2001

They walk past you
                                        weeping
                              for the leaves that burnt
                              & fell, the wood exposed
                              like bone, sculpture
                    that suddenly emerges
                    from white haze.
You old fortune-teller,
you could have told them
in their vibrant grief
whispering through the night wind
your breath held in your heart
like the trembling promise of tomorrow,
just before dawn
                    there was no pain
                             you are the wood
                                       not the leaf,
                                                 falling is not
                                                           falling but
                                                                     offering.






The Gulf of California
 

There are two memories of tides:
one for the deep blackness that split
away from the mother sea
and one for sea that found itself
in the daybreaks of rivers.
Yet it was all one sea
tracked by comets and the Elegant Tern,
seals in speckled pod-shaped skins,
and whales, opening their small eyes
when the hands of people drew fish
out of the salt.

Geologists tell us that the sea split
millions of years ago
before the Yoemem, Yoremem,
Kunkaak, O-Otam
curled their tongues around the names
of themselves and raised the conch shell 
to their lips, so that the sound of nature
became human, too:

kalifornia vaawe

Then the sea was measured
and divided into leagues.
The Spanish ships called it dangerous
because the sea tore in two ways,
tide and rivers,
so they contained it in maps
written on dead animal skins
with ink made from dried octopus blood

Mar de la Kalifornia
Golfo de California

Then it was named the Vermilion Sea
when the red-shelled crabs clicked in the waters.
It was the Sea of Corts
because it's the right of the Conqueror
to claim the world in his name.

It's his right to name hunger after himself
and to take away rivers
and children
and to give back the bare bones
of life
in the Queen's name.

What can you say about men
who name the mountains "mother
madre
when the worst curse they can shout
defiles their mother
in the act of creation?

Now we call the Gulf of California
polluted
with the pesticides of fields
and the wastes of factories.
And the voices of the fin-backed whale,
sardines, sea-kelp, anemone,
and turtle are quieter,
so that we have less memory
of the way it was
and less hope
for the way it will be.

In the winter I eat strawberries
from Mexico
and oranges, sectioned and split
apart
on my north continental plate.
I don't know much about my relatives
picking the fields near Bacum, Torim.
I don't know much about the spiny sea urchin,
except that it knows more than I
about the sea, the sea that names itself
unnameable
movable horizon.






Indian Vices (IN THE PERSONA OF FATHER OCH)
 

By nature Indians are very lazy and sworn enemies of work.They prefer to suffer hunger than to fatigue themselveswith agriculture. Therefore, they must be forced to do this by theirsuperiors. With six industrious Europeans one can do morein one day than fifty Indians--Joseph Och, Missionary in Sonora: Travel Reportsof Joseph Och, S.J., 1755-1767


Mining: The Indian is naked, swinging
quarter to half hundredweight steel-edged crowbars.
He climbs beams with notches set step by step,
carrying ore in plaited baskets
on his shoulders.
They are given one half-bushel of maize per week.
This is their payment unless they have a family
then they are given two half-bushels.

Two men using a wheelbarrow could haul out 
more than can thirty lazy Indians
working an entire day.

Natural resources: They are naked, with only a loincloth.
Otherwise they would steal valuable ore.
Instead they laugh
when their hair is thick with dusted gold
so that they look like ugly yellow-haired creatures.
Their hair is long and they secrete fragments
of ore there, wrapping their hair up
like a turban. You can no more trust them
than you would a Turk.

Gold and silver ore varies.
Some is very heavy, pure
silver spiked, as it were, 
with silver nails.
The completely black
very heavy ores
are considered the richest.

Processing: The Indian washes his hair
several times a day, sluicing water
over his long hair, letting the silver fall
into a bowl which he then strains,
keeping more silver.
Then again, the Indian must relieve himself
and he hides behind a bush,
thereby stealing more ore
in a most despicable way.

Some can be reduced by fire . . . 
or be broken up
and placed into a clay oven
. . . with molten lead,
until . . . the lead has amalgamated 
with the silver.
Pebbles and slag float on top
and are skinned off
with hoes and the lead heated
with a double fire
until it becomes light and frothy
like glass.
This froth is removed in heaps;
what remains is pure silver. 

The waste product: When the Indian dies,
perhaps careless at work, he is wrapped in a horse blanket.
Thread from deer or plant fiber
is used to sew him up.
It is heathen, this practice
of putting bows and arrows,
small bowls, and other things
in the grave. Instead, I pull the bell rope
and they are pleased at the songs
and lighted tapers
on the altar of the whitewashed church.
They die when they want to,
saying they are only journeying
to the next village.

They have many vices
which I have discovered
and abolished, including the throwing 
of patterned sticks,
which is like gambling.
They would rather lie on blankets
in the bushes, throwing these sticks
against the rough wool to muffle the sound,
than work in the fields
or in the mines which are very near,
nor do they think of tomorrow
and the profit that must be made,
whether it is gold, silver, maize,
or their heathenish souls.






Anonymous Is Coyote Girl
 

From a newspaper photo and article about my godfather, James Moreno, East Los Angeles, 1950.

       (Three police officers took a brutal beating in a wild free-for-all with a 
              family, including three young girls.
       From left, James, 19, and Alex, 22, in jail after the fracas
       on the porch of their home at 3307 Hunter.)

       Jimmy is staring off the page, hands in his pockets.
       A four-button dark shirt. No bruises,
       but he looks dazed.
       Alex wears a leather coat and a polka-dot shirt,
       which is in itself a crime.
       Nowhere is there a photo of a young girl
       with a face carved like a racetrack saint,
       eyes with all bets called off,
       grinning like a coyote.

       (Officer Parks had his glasses broken
       with his own sap
       and was thrown through a window.)

       Jimmy and Alex are my dad's cousins,
       lived on Boyle Heights and tortillas.
       Mama says the cops always harassed them, those nios
       from East L.A., driving their low-riders,
       chrome shinier than a cop's badge.
       And why wasn't Coyote Girl mentioned, that round-armed
       girl with a punch like a bag of bees,
       a girl with old eyes, her lips cracking open
       as she saw the cop sailing through glass, boiling out
       of Boyle Heights, skidding on the sidewalk, flat as a tortilla?

       (The officers received severe cuts and bruises,
       were treated at a hospital and released in time to jail the youths,
       who were charged with assault with a deadly weapon.)

       Two years later, I was born and Jimmy entered the church,
       hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched, watching the christening.
       Four drops of water, like popped-off wafer-thin buttons,
       fell on my head.
                   No.
       He never showed up that day
       or any other. My spiritual guardian must've been there
       in spirit only.
       He didn't know nada about Got and no one knows
       where he is today, but I think you could find him at the end
       of a knife. Or in the slash of the z
       in La Raza! the dark blood
       reds of graffiti. Or tomatoes
       grown in old coffee cans
       by a white-haired man
       sitting in the sun in a dark shirt,
       next to an old woman growing younger every day
       as I tell her story, my story,
       our story
       with all the grace and power
       of a deadly weapon.






A Sheep Dog Locked in Photograph
 

All the old photographs, hidden like buried
Treasure. Broken prayer sticks under my dreams

And my worn mattress. Each one like a postcard sent back
Home; wonders only seen in slick travel magazines.

Boxed up under my bed, colored souls on Kodak paper--
I can still see Grandma's smile next to her resting sheep dog.

Like a blue lightning strike over the northern sky,
Over two black houses, I pull the first leaf out, at random.

A picture-flash: Tom and Susie Worker are sitting together
On a couch covered with a large Navajo Chief's blanket woven

By her brown hands and sheep's wool. The pattern of stripes--
Blue to black to white, shifting like rain clouds to clear skies.

My grandparents look tired. The day was Christmas 1992,
With a little bit of snow on the Earth. Tired from traveling

Over 100 miles away from their painted desert
To the city, tired from raising eleven children of the Deer

Spring before the Depression, before Roosevelt,
Before the World Wars, before computers, before

Satellite phones and televisions . . . . Outside, the north wind
Was blowing Tuba City away. But, Grandma's and Grandpa's

Eyes are glazed red from happiness. Outside,
The clouds swelled full of snow and ice.

A blue lightning flash, another photograph, another place:
New York, 1985: I see the Statue of Liberty, tiny, like a pin

Stuck in the gray ocean, surrounded by the wrought metal
Edges of Gotham City. It was the only picture I took:

The dollar-bill green lady holding her torch, guiding
Moths, reality, men and ferries. As she stood in iconic

Pose, Grandma flooded back, quickly: strong in her own green
Velvet dress, she stretched dough over her palms, making frybread.

A foghorn wailed just past the Emerald City's fiery torch.
My mind refocused on the warm glow of a new moon.

The Lady's light filled the starless sky like Grandma's teardrop
Turquoise and silver brooch. Made from a thousand tiny Kingman

Nuggets, its shine captured in a perfect burst--
A sunflower high on a green stem. Each seed a raindrop

Made of smooth sky. When the sun touched the brooch,
It was blinding. A perfect mosaic of water-light-sky stones.

A blue strike--bright from a cigarette--steals Lady Liberty's light.
The Staten Island ferry moves on to Crow Agency, Montana.

At Custer Battlefield, my cousins smile for a picture, tourists
Next to Custer's grave. Defiant, wearing dark shades, 

They hold up cans of Coors Light waiting for Custer to rise
Again so they can take up their bows, arrows, uzis. Warriors,

Proud and ready to hide deep in the yellowtail prairie grass.
Their women and children safe in tipi camps by the Little

Bighorn River. I know they would die again and again. Rise
Again and again to put up more white marble tombstones.

They would do this to save our future children, to save our
Grandmas--Mary Black Eagle, Susie Worker, Great Great Great

Grandmother Lefthand . . . . They would save our grandfathers too--
Sonny Black Eagle, Tom Worker, the horned toad . . . .

Lodge Grass Indians, the high school basketball team, plays
A few miles from Mary's block house and her ten grazing horses. 

Her basketball team is waiting for the final winning basket
To end time, an orange ball to shoot dead the visiting team

From Billings. Another war of Savages versus Whites.
Won this time by the "Skins--Class "B State Champs again.

Two Leggings, a '49, a warrior's party. The tranquil dark
Raven feathers, a deep cold night fueled by a bonfire and beer.

Victory runs hot, steaming piss into the trout-filled river
Lined by a hundred cars, nights caws, and some more tame

Drinking brawls. All night long, the happy Indian basketball
Warriors sing '49 songs: We won, but my dark-hair girlfriend

Left with one of the blue-eyed. He na ya na . . . .
My brothers smile with big white teeth, have strong backs like their

Broncos and are blessed with good looks. That's what Crow boys
Do best--look good and play good ball. I wish Grandma Susie

Was here to see her young Crow and Navajo boys, their hearts full
Of wild war ponies. But because of old age, she was put in a home

Where she is reverting back into a baby--quivering mouth, softening
Body like melting ice cream, wetting her bed--as her nurse-mother sighs.

Grandma is there captured within the state-certified white walls.
Reflections appear--Kit Carson, Custer, Andrew Jackson's ghosts--

In the many stainless steel items of the room: the nearby syringe,
The mirror, the drinking cup, the stethoscope. The nurse turns off

The television, it buzzes and flashes a bright blue dot that burns
In my grandmother's retina. More ghosts appear, this time as lost

Shadows on film behind the great family photo. Our pasts
Flood back from the Sea of Forgetfulness . . . . Old girlfriends,

Old boyfriends, old wives, old husbands--grainy moments belonging
To brothers, cousins, sisters, friends. Their demands are frenzied

As mean seagulls overwhelming me holding a bag of popcorn:
Burn those! Burn them up! Why the hell did you keep them alive?!

I should burn them so that the stars can smell the rising visions.
When the sunrise burns the nightmares, like flies stuck on the silk

In a dreamcatcher, the visions explode into flares. Bright as a blue
Ball lightning floating mysteriously over Grandma Susie's place.

Her reservation home with its sleek red canyons, rabbit brush,
Sand dunes, is like seeing Giza's pyramids, Disneyland, Stonehenge,

The Grand Canyon. A place filled with the awe of fairy dust,
A dinosaur's tooth, a pure gold coin. I pick up the last

Leaf that floats into my hands. Here, Grandma's sheep corral
Is empty of foul smells. And there staring at me is my last image:

A sheep dog locked in photograph. Grandma's sheep dogs
Never have names and the only word they ever learn

And know is "Dib! "Dib! "Dib! 
A command as heavy as hail shattering a windshield:

"Dib! Go back to the sheep, now! Watch over them!
Watch out for sheep-stealing coyotes.

They all run like hurt boys glancing up to see if the sky will fall.
This one sheep dog is a mutt sitting next to his empty

Dog dish--a Chevy hubcap. His eyes are black marbles:
One eye is Hungry, one eye is Lonely. With only

A life span of three years, a sheep dog dies from the elements,
Fighting a mountain lion, or from a gunshot wound

(For a developing a taste for tender lamb).
Taking care of sheep is their story. Like the many tribes

Wiped out from smallpox long before the white man
Gave the tribe a history, and because we forgot them,

They, the sheep dogs, die nameless too. When Grandma was happy
With her sheep dogs, she would feed them a can of government

Peanut butter and watch them chew, chew, chew. Licking.
She watched each one lick its teeth and fur for hours . . . . 

I can still hear her laughing about her sheep dogs.





Post-Modernity in Kayenta
 

after Elizabeth Bishopfor Scott Manning Stevens
The monoliths, sandstone
carvings crest high
in the air, tall like redwoods
with striking wind-eroded,
rain-washed, sunny edges.
Driving from the East,
two lovers from Chicago
discover a new city
made of sand cliffs,
rabbit brush, red soil,
a prairie dog's echoes,
heavy dark clouds,
sharp yucca. Sheep dot
the valley, nibbling on
wild green shoots.
Monument Valley--
50 miles from Kayenta.
A small Navajo town
holding onto the edges
of the Earth, encircled 
by purple mountains,
dry mud washes, jackrabbit
burrows, shifting sand slopes,
coyote tracks, some
small thirsty juniper trees . . .
Four cows walk slowly
away from the sun to
the nearest gas station
looking for shade.
On the AAA map,
the road breaks
into two black veins:
interstate or road?
K-town to San Diego.
With no trendy clubs nearby,
these two hungry men see the neon
hamburger sign: Burger King.
Like walking into a Life magazine
pictorial of the Southwest, the men
walk through the pages of the fast-
food chain. There are four Navajo
families, their grandmothers
wearing glossy crushed velvet
dresses colored with deep splashes
of late-spring orchids, red or purple.
Decorated like royalty with turquoise
and silver bracelets, intricate inlaid
pins and concho belts. Around
their weathered necks are long 
strands of white shell, coral or heavy 
silver squash blossoms. Their black
hair tied back with white yarn
in a tight figure-eight bun.
On the bright orange walls
are the large black and white photos--
The Navajo Code Talkers,
watching grandfathers dressed 
in pollen-yellow uniforms
and apple-red military caps,
with metal stars and stripes
pinned to them. Their eyes
are pieces of charcoal 
already burnt-out from seeing war 
and sleeping among the dead bodies.
Even the Blessing Way ceremonies
can't purify their cataracts.
During WWII, they talked in code,
in a language reserved 
for the wind. Or bears.
A code the Japanese couldn't break:
the wind's whistle or the bear's growl--
drowning Asian intonations
and clicking grasshoppers.
These grandfathers
saved the country so their
screaming grandchildren
could learn to be Din and run
around and around holding
half a hamburger and spilling
broken pieces of French fries across
ivory tiles. One little girl,
dark and pretty with high cheek-
bones and messy hair,
smiles at the attractive blond
man waiting to order.
Holding her hand up high
she shows him her kid's meal toy.
Lewis sees the plastic details:
a perfect smiles, candy-apple red lips,
large breasts, dark eyes, purple eye
shadow, a buckskin dress,
long frozen black hair,
with a rock turquoise necklace.
It's one of the many Disney
Girls--Pocahontas. He smiles,
imagining this Navajo girl
wanting to be the icon.
In college, he remembers
studying late with a new leaf
moon for a history exam on
Indians and the Early Settlers
of the 1800s.
Pocahontas was an Indian guide
(but he can't remember from
which tribe). He remembers
that women guides were
often called sleeping dictionaries,
exotic women translating words
and finding less treacherous routes
full of gold nuggets or beaver
pelts for fur trappers,
explorers, white men . . . . These men,
most of the time, slept
with their guides, maybe
like "Lewis and Clark. Lewis
remembers that his Clark
is waiting for him--overwhelmed
and starved at the table rubbing
his hard abs, still trying 
to figure out which road to take:
K-town to San Diego,
interstate or road?
The Disney Girl's mother
pulls her away from him,
thinking her daughter is bothering
him or maybe she knows about
Lewis and Clark.
She apologizes in broken English,
different from his Chicaga accent.
The sunset is different in this
land without the best architecture
like the Wrigley or the John Hancock
buildings rising taller than the natural
red earth skyscrapers and clouds.
Different without the one lonely 
Water Tower he feels kinship with
because it survived the Great Fire.
Lewis wonders all this, in the dying 
light of day, as he orders
from another Pocahontas in a 
maroon uniform, in Kayenta,
Arizona, on the Navajo Reservation
without the barbed wired fences,
sanctioned by a White government
after the Long Walk--
the forced walk of thousands
of Navajos in the same coldsnap
of a Chicago winter, unforgiving.
Lewis sees the tiny exploitations again,
seemingly harmless toys given
to countless Navajo girls, and knows
they too must walk the Long Walk--
without a map, they walk from 
Ft. Defiance to Bosque Redondo
which is their same journey
through life, the corn pollen path
over the reservation and past
every modern man-made city.

After all this,
It's like imagining 
how old, how big
the universe is--
endless,
endless . . . .

Starlight, galaxies, silent 
comets. Red maple leaves
spiraling up to the sky
like another great fire swallowing
Chicago under a blinding sandstorm.
In 1864, the Long Walk begins
in cold ice; in 1871 the Great Chicago 
Fire ends in white flames . . . . 
Clark still tracing his fingernail
along Route 66 to nowhere.
Children figure-eight skating
on ice, circling and circling Chicago.
The empty eyes of the Code Talkers
watching the Japanese war
prisoners, who were kept in war
camps on the reservation and 
locked in photograph and on the opposite 
side of the wall, black and white stills.
Clark dancing shirtless under strobe--
he's slick as a black crow's feathers.
Four cows still resting under
a gas station's awning--

But all joining in a single thought,
a moment blowing away in Kayenta's 
coming monsoon or on
the sunny beaches of San Diego.

Lewis clears his voice:

"I'll have four
Whoppers with cheese and 
no onions . . . .






Refusing to Be Blessed
 

And what of the dead? They lie without shoesIn their stone boots. They are more like stonethan the sea would be if it stopped. They refuseto be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone. --Anne Sexton
Pick up the smooth stone at your boot tip--
Quickly blow the dust off the edge.
This is for Sexton's mother who died March
1959. This is for Sexton's father who died

June 1959. This is for love born in September
1949. When Autumn came, it left the trees bare. 
Leaves are but whisper ready to become snow.
No sign of a harvest, no corn. This is for Anne.

I breathe out carbon, breathe in carbon, in early
October 1971. The stones in the river's currents
Are polished. I was conceived in the empty
Winter. Little did I know when Coyote threw

His one stone into the perfect pool, it meant
One by one, we die just as amber mosquitoes.
For the Navajo people, Coyote threw the stone
Into the ocean for our survival. Across the ocean,

Past television screens--Marie, sweet Marie--
This is for Marie's voice and scrolling words:
Tumor in the back of the head. The black birds
Fill the sky as icy hail: It Must Have Been Love.

September 2002, I have lived another year.
I wish Sweden to keep her goddess of music.
Another new moon passes and I understand
The word terminal. This is for Coyote

And his ability to hide his life force. This again
Is for understanding Sexton today. This is for
My mother who will weave an AIDS quilt.
She'll use a loom and yarn and tears, this is for

Love and hoping that when the universe ends 
We never hear the splash. We never hear th--






A Well-Traveled Coyote
 

John F. Kennedy
        New York City
            I saw him across the lobby
                 flight 161
                     St. Louis
                         Albuquerque.
Coyote looked in control
        cool 
             fitting right into the city
                 smiling when a pretty woman passed him
                     figuring out his flight
                          making calculations from behind
                              the New York Times.
Slick
         right down to his Tony Lamas
             Coyote
                 I'd recognize him anywhere
                     Copenhagen
                          New York
                              Gallup.
People say
you can dress 'em up
        but once a coyote
             always a coyote.






Gias Song
 

Thung joo Kwa yaa na povi sah
Thung joo Kwa yaa na povi sah
       Tsay ohi taa geh wo gi wa naa povi sah
       pin povi
       pin povi do mu u da kun

On top of Black Mesa there are flowers
On top of Black Mesa there are flowers
       dew on yellow flowers
       mountain flowers I see
       so far away that it makes me cry.
She opened her eyes slowly,
       as if to awaken from a trance
           cast by a song,
           transporting her to childhood,
       Back to the flowers  
       growing atop Black Mesa,
       so far and yet
       clearly brilliant.
Awake from the song,
       Gia focused on her daughter,
       anxiously awaiting 
       to be taught a new song.
The old woman chose to take her time,
       she had learned from experience,
       attention is better paid by children,
       when there is a little pause,
           and mystery
               in storytelling.
Soon enough Gia spoke . . . 
        "When I was a young girl,
        my family would camp 
        below Kwheng sa po,
        during the farming months.
        We spent most of our days
        following my grandmother
        through rows of corn
        and playing in the streams below.
        One day white men came in a wagon,
        telling us about a school for Indians,
        run by the government.
        We were told this school would educate
        and prepare us for jobs in the white man's world. 
        None of us knew what any of it meant,
        but these men spoke sweetly
        offering grandmother a roll of baling wire
        for each child that went to school.
        Before we knew what was happening,
        we were sitting in the back of their wagon,
        on our way to government school,
        away from our families,
        to another man's world.
        Often we would cry,
        out of loneliness,
        but this song helped us
        to remember our home.
Get thoughtfully straightened
the pleats on her skirt,
swallowing the last of her coffee.
Smiling, she continued . . . 
        "The government school taught sewing,
        I learned on an electric machine.
        By the time I returned to the village I could
        sew, but few of the people had heard of sewing machines,
        or even electricity.
        The machine I learned to operate as my trade
        could not be carried here and there,
        but this song you are learning,
        will always be carried in your heart,  
        here and there.






A Declaration, Not of Independence
 

for my mother and father
Apparently I'm Mom's immaculately-conceived
Irish-American son, because,
Social-Security time come,
my Cherokee dad could not prove he'd been born.

He could pay taxes, though,
financing troops, who'd conquered our land,
and could go to jail,
the time he had to shoot or die,
by a Caucasian attacker's knife.

Eluding recreational killers' calendar's
enforcers, while hunting my family's food,
I thought what the hunted think,
so that I ate, not only meat
but the days of wild animals fed by the days
of seeds, themselves eating earth's
aeons of lives, fed by the sun,
rising and falling, as quail,
hurtling through sky,

fell, from gun-powder, come--
as the First Americans came--
from Asia.

Explosions in cannon,
I have an English name,
a German-Chilean-American wife
and could live a white life,
but, with this hand,
with which I write, I dug,
my sixteenth summer, a winter's supply of yams out
of hard, battlefield clay,
dug for my father's mother, who--
abandoned by her husband--raised,
alone, a mixed-blood family
and raised--her tongue spading air--
ancestors, a winter's supply or more.





Passing Rez School the Day before Thanksgiving Day, Unoriginal Sin and a Redskin Pilgrims Retrogression
 

Footpath passing a school,

undiscovered by a nun
black at her blackboard's explanation
of Vanishing Americans' vanishing, I find myself

flagged, by two not quite red rows,
unfurled into grin, two white, and by one
five-pointed, pale star.

My lips let my teeth pledge allegiance,
again, my fingers orbiting their own warmth,
around this pen,
as straight as Old Glory's tall pole, but
admittedly, ingloriously smaller, and,

as the star descends, it draws,
from Christian calendars' precision constellations,
a child--hand cramped
from fisting fact onto dusty black
clutching a wand,
to draw him Everywhere.

Though the teacher scowls
us back to my dead, risen from
The Trail of Tears

as chalk,
this day before Thanksgiving Day; a child
will lead, as I finish taking my walk.





Six Prayers
 

Thunderer     God of the turbulent sky     may
my turbulent mind shape
for my people
rain clouds
beans
pumpkins
and yams.

East Spirit
Dawn Spirit     may
birds awaken in
the forest of teeth
whose river     your color     must say
frozen mountains'
prayer that you
will loosen them.

Spirit of the North
whose star is our
white mark
like the blaze we chop in the black bark
where the trail home
divides
even in
our homes
we need
you to guide.

Spirit of the Sunset West
may gray clouds
hiding friends from me
glow
like yours
that we grope
toward each other through
a vivid rose.

Spirit of the South
direction of
warm wind
warm rain
and the winter sun
like a pale painting of a morning glory
help me     Spirit     that in my mind humble things
a man may give to his child may grow
the blue of berry
orange of squash
crimson of radish
yellow of corn
when the green of even the tallest pine
is wolf tooth white.

Spirit of the Earth
keeper of Mother Father
Sister Brother
loved ones all
once praying
as I pray
or in some other way
Spirit     the black dirt
is like the black cover of
a book whose words
are black ink I can
not read
but I place my brown hand
on snow
and pray that more than snow
may melt.





Culture and the Universe
 

Two nights ago
in the canyon darkness,
only the half-moon and stars,
only mere men.
Prayer, faith, love,
existence.
                       We are measured
by vastness beyond ourselves.
Dark is light.
Stone is rising.

I don't know
if humankind understands
culture: the act
of being human
is not easy knowledge.

With painted wooden sticks
and feathers, we journey
into the canyon toward stone,
a massive presence
in midwinter.

We stop.
                       Lean into me.
                       The universe 
sings in quiet meditation.

We are wordless:
                       I am in you.

Without knowing why
culture needs our knowledge,
we are one self in the canyon.
                                                                    And the stone wall
I lean upon spins me
wordless and silent
to the reach of stars
and to the heavens within.

It's not humankind after all
nor is it culture 
that limits us.
It is the vastness
we do not enter.
It is the stars 
we do not let own us.






Busted Boy
 

He couldn't have been more than sixteen years old, 
likely even fifteen. Skinny black teenager, loose sweater.
When I got on Bus #6 at Prince and 1st Avenue,
he got on too and took a seat across from me.
A kid I didn't notice too much because two older guys,
street pros reeking with wine, started talking to me.
They were going to California, get their welfare checks,
then come back to Arizona in time for food stamps.

When the bus pulled into Ronstadt Transit Center,
the kid was the last to get off the bus right behind me.
I started to cross the street to wait for Bus #8
when two burly men, one in a neat leather jacket
and the other in a sweat shirt, both cool yet stern,
smoothly grabbed the kid and backed him against
a streetlight pole and quickly cuffed him to the pole. 

Plastic handcuffs. Practiced manner. Efficiently done. 
Along with another Indian, I watch what's happening.
Nobody seems to notice or they don't really want to see.
Everything is quiet and normal, nothing's disturbed.
The other Indian and I exchange glances, nod, turn away.
Busted boy. Busted Indians. Busted lives. Busted again.

I look around for the street guys going to California.
But they're already gone, headed for the railroad tracks. 
I'm new in Tucson but I'm not a stranger to this scene.
Waiting for the bus, I don't look around for plainclothes.
I know they're there, in this America, waiting. There; here.
Waiting for busted boys, busted Indians, busted lives.






Time as Memory as Story
 

                        Let's say it's half a century later.                        Let's say it's never too late.                        Let's say Skull Valley.                        Let's say.                        Let's say it's half a century later.                        Let's say it's never too late.                        Let's say Skull Valley.                        Let's say.
Time has no mercy. It's there. It stays still or it moves.
And you're there with it. Staying still or moving with it.
I think it moves. And we move with it. And keep moving.

Eleven years old and soon to be in fifth grade. That's time. 
Boys' time. Who knows what time it is but them. Eternally. 
No one knows time better than they. Always and forever.

Our family. Mama, me, Angie, Gilbert, Earl, Louise.
Kids. Daddy working in Skull Valley for the AT&SF RY.
Mama just packed us up in New Mexico and moved us. 

Suddenly. A surprise. To me anyway. To join Daddy.
Who was away most of the time. Arizona. California.
Sometimes Colorado. Sometimes Texas. Always away.

Railroad work, labor, heavy machinery. Rails and sun.
Trains always moving. I remember the war. The 1940s.
Soldiers. Tanks. Cannons with huge guns and wheels.

Time does have mercy. But it doesn't enumerate or wait.
It moves. And we move with it. Though for boys, maybe?
I wanted to wait. So things could happen more gently. 

A boy misses his father. A boy watches younger sisters.
And younger brothers. All growing. And he's growing.
And he misses the times his mother is happy, laughing.

Who knows time as well as boys and their young worries?
I was a boy growing within a family, community. And dreams.
And girls. Girl teenagers. I adored them, their pretty ways.

In the fourth grade at McCartys. Made a bookshelf in shop.
Proudly. Sanded. Varnished. Shiny. For my Mama.
With love. I wanted to be a good carpenter like my Dad.

Dad drank though. Dark moods. Dark scary times. Danger.
And words hurtful, abrasive, accusing. Anger, pain, scorn.
A boy wonders. About time. About forever. When it ends.

I loved my Dad. Wonderful. Skilled man. Artist, singer.
Precious and assuring. Yet. Yet. Unpredictable moments.
You can never tell about time either. Like that, it is. It is.

We farmed. Corn, melons, chili, beets, carrots, cilantro.
Onions. Even potatoes in little mounds but they died.
Corn fields at night. Irrigating. June nights. I loved forever.

My grandpa I loved very much. Time was soothing then.
We didn't really need time when days and nights were safe.
And with him they were. A healer and respected kiva elder.

Herded his sheep. Along with my uncle Estevan. And Roy.
Roy was a strange one. Chinese manner. So people said.
From Chinatown in California. He had a gentle soft smile.

And a storyteller he was. Yes. About his horse. Lightning.
Fast and nimble and quick. Lightning, his horse. He'd ride.
Yes, ride to see his girl to call her outside. Estella! Estella!

Stories. I'd listen. The boy I was. Seeing my uncle riding.
Riding his fast and nimble horse. I'd listen and he'd smile.
Memory and time. It doesn't count all the time. Listening. 

And because mothers are always loving. Alert. Ever caring.
Mama decided we must go to Skull Valley where Dad was.
Up to Grants, the depot there, we got on the westbound train.

Sacks and boxes, a trunk, suitcase or two. Clothes, things.
What did we have? I don't remember. Not much though. 
We never had much. Poor. And lonely for Dad always away.

I wonder. I wonder. Too often that's been the Indian story.
Father gone. Mother and kids left behind. Is it like that?
Yes, too much. Dad didn't like working for the hard railroad. 

He'd complain and rant about the crude and mean whites. 
The slave rules. The company. Trains powerful, unending.
Time I thought was in the trains. Fast, loud, dangerous. 

I was afraid of the powerful trains. Like I said I'd see them.
Soldiers, army troop trains, going east and going west.
Unending. I wondered where they were all going. Where?

Lightning and thunder trapped in the train power and steel. 
Yet I yearned for blue song. Hollow and lonely long tone.
Coming round the bend, and something beyond the horizon. 

Far away maybe. Travel. Some other dream. Youth. Yes.
I liked songs. Music I heard on the radio. Hank Williams.
And stories that rang through the air. Talk and listening.

It was the first time ever we were leaving the reservation.
Only one world till then it seemed. Acoma community. Ours.
On the edge of another world though, something strange. 

And fearful too. The dark moments. Like when Daddy drank.
When there was fire from another world. An unknown.
Yet fascinating somehow, oddly, something on the far horizon.

I didn't remember riding the train before. Ever! Until then.
Like riding thunder. The horse, Lightning, Roy talked about.
Riding off somewhere into the dark night. Fast, fast. Fast.

Riding toward night. We watched the land speeding away.
Far across the land, along the edge of it was a highway.
With cars and trucks. Moving, moving. Only slower.

Time speeds, like you speed. Only not an awareness.
Or any way to tell what is taking place. When young.
And you're trying to furnish your own answers, solutions.

To mysteries you're anxious about. When all's uncertain.
Youth is not the time when time is apparent. Too slow.
Or too fast. And you don't really have clear reasons. Yet.

At Ashfork we got off the train onto the depot platform.
I sensed being lost. Lost mother and lost children. Dusk. 
Where was this world? Where did home go? Children?

Lost at the edge of a strange world with a gray green depot.
Large letters painted. Little sister is hungry. She whimpers.
Mama says, "Hold my hand. We walk, up street, walk, walk.

It could be Indians. A family, mother and children. Lost?
Where are they going? Up the street I think. Looking.
For something to eat. My mother held only a little money.

Hamburgers we split. Water and water. Self-conscious.
Moment is time. I looked out and saw a train passing.
Our train! I thought it was our train. But it wasn't, just fear!

Wait. Then a train down Chino Valley. Long-distance night.
Stars vanished in too much night. Long day into night.
Where does time go? Does it go nowhere but into night?

Then at the sudden edge. The horizon. A vast bowl of light.
And only at the far end, trees. And still far ahead of us. 
The train engine light. Always a light showing the way.

My brother and I excited. A deer stunned by train light. 
Stilled. Stark. A cut stone. The dazzling moment held us.
Youth and time. Nothing like it. Thrilled. Never until then.

Years later I tried to tell about that moment to a love.
But love is time too. So. Can't do anything but live time.
The horizon and beyond. Full of stars. Even unseen.

Always belief is firmer than faith. With and without dreams.
We arrived in Skull Valley early in the morning. Three-thirty?
Where were we? On the other side of the moon from Acoma.

A mother and her children and assorted bags and boxes.
Dreams. Time. Horizon. Farther from home than belief. 
It felt like that. Within moment when you can't turn away.

A train depot on the other side of the moon. Deserted. 
After the train pulled away. Only the rails and starshine.
What's a boy say to his mother? Earlier than anything.

A man whose picture I'd seen. White man. With a cap.
With a visor. Sitting at a tall wooden desk with shelves.
And a metal puzzle thing making clicking-clacking noises.

Who spoke with Mama. Who smiled. Who wondered at us. 
An Indian woman with Indian children. Who were strangers.
Like we just came from the planet Acoma. The other side.

Of day. Of the present early morning night in that moment.
The telegrapher with the visor said. I think. I think he did.
He knew my father. Knew where he lived. Two miles away.

So we took a road. Early, early morning night trek. Time.
Shimmers in an odd amazing way. Within what might be.
A boy and a story. The dawn coming. Horizon ever so near.

When we knocked on his railroad worker housing door.
Daddy was shocked. In his underwear. Shadows upon.
And the background of his and Mama's and our history.

We come to discover each other. All failures and gains. 
Counting and mattering, no matter the time or sequence.
We laugh and hug and cry. Daddy. Daddy. We're here.

Once again together. Family, history, travel, time, love.
To say what time is, even fifty years in the past to now.
In this moment, Skull Valley is just as real as it ever was.

Memory we cross and cross again. Treks, trauma, and on.
We do know what time is. It is loss and gain. A lingering.
Within discovery we come to ourselves. Finding. Destiny.

Moments recalled like friends. It was that way or another.
We're fairly certain either way. Stories. They are with us.
Time doesn't forsake. It doesn't soothe or decrease. Never.

Skull Valley. A time for a boy. History engulfed beyond.
When I went back. Recently. I ate with friends at the cafe.
By the railroad track. I was fascinated by photographs.

Of the mountain lions in the mountains nearby. Ever there.
No matter what. And the stories of bones. Tall tales or truths.
They're told. Apaches, it's said. Wagon trains. Lies or no.

Our history is more than here. We know more than realize.
We realize what we don't know. Or want to know. Truths.
Stalk us, just like they found. A boy. More than fifty years ago. 

He discovered a world beyond Acoma. A world apart.
And a world together as time, memory, as story. As his own.
We seek and are found. Secure. Actual. Safe. And serene.

Last summer near Prescott that boy fifty vast years later.
Found carved images on stone walls that fit his hands.
Carved in time. Eternal as stone. Past and present. Ever.

                                                                Let's say it is ever an ongoing story.





The Storm
 

Like people
emerging from a steambath,
bending over,
steaming from their heads
and shoulders,
the ring of the mountains
from the Chilkat Range
to the Juneau ice field
as if in steambath towels
of snow flurries;
at their feet
are foaming white caps of sea
like water thrown on rocks
steaming from the heat.





Grandmother Eliza
 

My grandmother Eliza
was the family surgeon.
Her scalpel made from a pocketknife
she kept in a couple of pinches of snoose.
She saved my life by puncturing
my festering neck twice with her knife.
She saved my brother's life twice
when his arm turned bad.
The second time she saved him
was when his shoulder turned bad.
She always made sure
she didn't cut an artery.
She would feel around for days
finding the right spot to cut.
When a doctor found out
she saved my brother's life
he warned her,
"You know you could go to jail for this?

Her intern, my Auntie Anny, saved my life
when I cut a vessel on my toe.
While my blood was squirting out
she went out into the night
and cut and chewed the bark
of plants she knew.
She  put the granules of chewed up bark
on my toe before the eyes of the folks
who came to console my mother
because I was bleeding to death.
Grandma's other intern, Auntie Jennie,
saved our uncle's life when his son
shot him through the leg by accident.
A doctor warned her, too,
when he saw how she cured.
Her relative cured herself of diabetes.
Now, the doctors keep on asking,
"How did you cure yourself?





Amelias First Ski Run
 

Eaglecrest, Juneau, February 24, 1989
Amelia, space-age girl
at top of Sourdough
makes her run with Eagle Grandpa Dick,
Raven girl, balancing on space,
gliding on air
in Tlingit colors:
black pants, turquoise jacket,
yellow shoulder patches,
black hair like feathers
clinging to her head,
face the color of red cedar.
Once in a while
I could even see space
between her legs and skis.
Diving downhill
she continues
side to side, slalom style,
following Grandpa's red boots.
Then the two figures swoop around the
corner,
swishing downhill,
shooshing home.






The Blue Stairs
 

There is no fear
in taking the first step
or the second 
or the third
                                 having a position 
                                 between several Popes

In fact the top
can be reached
without disaster

                                 precocious 

The code 
consists in noticing
the particular shade
of the staircase

                                 occasionally giving way
                                 to the emotions

It has been chosen
discriminately

To graduate 
the dimensions
ease them into sight

                                 republic of space

Radiant deepness
a thumb
passed over it

                                 disarming
                                 as one who executes robbers

Waving the gnats
and the small giants
aside

                                 balancing

How to surprise
a community
by excellence

somehow it occurred

                                 living a public life

The original design
was completed
no one complained

In a few years
it was forgotten

                                 floating

It was framed
like any other work of art
not too ignobly

                                 kicking the ladder away

Now I shall tell you
why it is beautiful

Design: extraordinary
color:    cobalt blue

                                 secret platforms

Heels twist it
into shape

It has a fantastic area
made for a tread
that will ascend

Being humble
i.e. productive

Its purpose
is to take you upward

On an elevator 
of human fingerprints
of the most delicate 
fixity

Being practical
and knowing its denominator

To push
one foot ahead of the other

Being a composite
which sneers at marble

                                 all orthodox movements

It has discovered
in the creak of a footstep
the humility of sound

Spatially selective
using this counterfeit 
of height

To substantiate 
a method of progress

Reading stairs 
as interpolation
in the problem of gradualness

                                 with heavy and pure logic

The master builder
acknowledges this

As do the artists
in their dormer rooms

                                 eternal banishment

Who are usually grateful
to anyone who prevents them
from taking a false step

And having reached the summit
would like to stay there
even if the stairs are withdrawn





The Place Where Clouds Are Formed
 

I
Every day it is the same.
He comes home.
He tells her about it.
As he speaks, his breath condenses in front of his face.
She goes about her business;
every now and then she looks over.
She doesn't hear his voice.
She sees the soft fog that continues to form a halo.
She knows he is still talking about that place.
He never tires of it like she does.
Only on summer days when the air is hot
and moisture is still a long time in coming,
she asks him to tell her about that place.
She sits facing him.
Waiting for the first vocalic, non-stops,
the push of air from his lips.
He tells her of the place where clouds are formed.
The cool dampness of his voice is rich.
Even on a dry June day
her face beads with wetness
as he talks directly to her.
Each aspirated sound a gentle burst of coolness.
"Tell me again, tell me again, she teases.
If he knew she only wanted relief from the heat
and not the story, he would stop talking.
He begins, "The first time I saw the place
where clouds are formed was from
the window of a train . . .
Another time was in a mirage
in the heat outside Tucson.
Once he thought he saw it
in the dry light of stars.
The place he remembers best
was when he saw it in the eyes
of a woman he spoke to.
When he first noticed it,
she hid it by lowering her gaze.
Soon she let him look freely.
There were times when she opened her eyes
wide, allowing an unobscured view.
Sometimes he saw her eyes smolder
with dryness on a summer day.
Other times she was rich with moisture.
Clouds came in succession. 
The earth's shadows muted.
"You know the forty days
and forty nights?
I was there.
I'll be there when it happens again,
she said with a slight smile.
Like a child, he rushed to look 
into her eyes at every opportunity.
If he could, he would hang on her eye socket,
peering inside, 
marveling at her displays.


II
An unusually cold December day right around Christmas;
clouds, mist find solace in the canyons of the Santa Catalina Mountains.
White moisture quietly moving amid the cactus.
Truly, clouds, wind, and rain are the few elements
that can touch the saguaro from head to foot.
Oblivious of spines, needles.
Rubbery hide surrounded, soothed by elements.
Contact triggers stored heat of remembered summers.
Moisture beads roll forward, unstoppable.
From the city below
we see mist rising, mist rising.


III
We sit close in the cab of the truck.
The weather is cold, wet outside.
Too messy to stand in
waiting for a school bus.
My father's truck is warm inside,
having been at work since four a.m.
The sound of the engine is soothing,
heater working to capacity.
Inside the cab we are silent.
We don't need language.
We listen to the regular hum of the engine,
rhythm of the windshield wipers,
soft rain on the hood.
Aware of the cold air
surrounding our temporary shelter.
We look out over the fields
where fog clings to the soil.
Every now and then
with the back of his gloved hand
he wipes the windshield.
"Is it coming yet?
The three of us sit quietly,
breathing clouds.
Clouds condense as
they contact the coolness of the windows.
My father appears to breathe air
with temperature in balance.
He forms no clouds.
He watches us.
We continue to breathe
gray, soft mist, waiting for the school bus.






Proclamation
 

Cuk Son is a story.
Tucson is a linguistic alternative.
The story is in the many languages 
still heard in this place of
Black Mountains.
They are in the echo of lost, forgotten languages
heard here even before the people arrived.

The true story of this place 
recalls people walking
deserts all their lives and
continuing today, if only
in their dreams.
The true story is ringing
in their footsteps in a 
place so quiet, they can hear 
their blood moving
through their veins.
Their stories give shape to the 
mountains encircling this place.
Wa:k is the story of
water memories of this desert.

Citizens gravitate to Sabino Canyon.
The humming, buzzing, clicking of water life,
the miracle of desert streams
on smooth boulders.
Rocks, sediment older than life itself 
serve as reminders.
It should be unnecessary for sticky notes
to remind us what a desert place is.
A place dependent on rains of summer,
light dusting of snow,
the rarity of dry beds as rebel rivers.
It is real desert people who lift their faces
upward with the first signs of moisture.
They know how to inhale properly.
Recognizing the aroma of creosote in the distance.
Relieved the cycle is beginning again.
These people are to be commended.

It is others who lament the heat of
a June day, simultaneously
finding pride on surviving
the heat--a dry heat.
These individuals should simply
be tolerated.

Opposed to those who move
from one air-conditioned environment
to another, never acknowledging the heat of summer.
Being grateful for November, when
temperatures drop below eighty,
complaining of the lack of seasons in the desert,
heading for mountains
to see colors--
these people--well, what can we say.
We must feel for the dogs of Tucson.
Who bark as if they belong to somebody and
who, before the rain, wish they were a color other than black.





Smoke in Our Hair
 

The scent of burning wood holds
the strongest memory.
Mesquite, cedar, pion, juniper,
all are distinct.
Mesquite is dry desert air and mild winter.
Cedar and pion are colder places.
Winter air in our hair is pulled away,
and scent of smoke settles in its place.
We walk around the rest of the day
with the aroma resting on our shoulders.
The sweet smell holds the strongest memory.
We stand around the fire.
The sound of the crackle of wood and spark
is ephemeral.
Smoke, like memories, permeates our hair,
our clothing, our layers of skin.
The smoke travels deep
to the seat of memory.
We walk away from the fire;
no matter how far we walk,
we carry this scent with us.
New York City, France, Germany--
we catch the scent of burning wood;
we are brought home.







The Man Who Drowned in the Irrigation Ditch
 

She always got mad at him
every time he came home in the middle of the morning
with his pant legs wet.
She knew he had fallen in the ditch again.
His legs were not strong enough to be straddling ditches.
He was too old to be walking over temporary dikes.
She wished he didn't do that, but sometimes he had to.
She sometimes imagined him falling over backward in one of the irrigation ditches,
his head hitting hard cement,
his body slowly sinking into the water.
Water that was only three feet deep.
A harmless three feet of water,
where children played,
and ladies sometimes sat and dipped their feet,
especially on hot summer evening.
She knew he would drown,
she knew it was bound to happen sometime. 

As far as the eye could see,
flat, green fields appearing to end at the foot of distant mountains.
Mountains, a reminder of what the fields once looked like.
Fields saturated with water pulled from its secret storage place
beneath the earth's surface.

We are called "the people of the cotton fields
because of the labor our families did.
For us there was no reservation, no Housing & Urban Development, no tribal support.
We were a people segregated in row houses
all lined up along the roads of our labor.

It is a muggy summer evening. 
My father, my sister, and I sit on the east side of the house finding shade against the still-hot setting sun.
The change from brilliant white sun to blue and gold sunset and finally,
to warm darkness, a change we anticipate for brief relief.

On this evening the anticipation is shattered.
A boy comes to the house. He gestures for my father to come to him, out of our hearing.
With what the boy says to him my father moves quickly.
As quickly as his stiff back and legs can move him.
Back and legs broken and fused from when he was a cowboy.
He rushes by, throwing the kitchen door open, grabbing his hat.
He gets into his truck and drives away.

We pay him no mind other than for the fact that he is rushing.
A second later my mother comes out of the house and with a single motion pulls her apron off.
In a tone I recognize as signifying something is wrong, she instructs us to come with her.
She starts in the direction of a cotton field a few hundred yards from our house.
My sister and I walk beside her.
Saying nothing.
Her hands wring the towel she carries with her.
This towel, a multipurpose kind of thing.
Women carry it to fan themselves,
to wipe sweat, to cover their heads and eyes from the sunlight, to shoo away kids, dogs, flies.
I remember once a student of mine, out of habit, brought her towel with her to summer school at the university.
Whenever we see each other on campus during a summer session we always laugh about it.

We continue to walk, stepping over the ends of rows of cotton.
Rows of cotton my family and I know well.
In early summer we walk the rows to thin out the growth,
and later we walk to chop the weeds somehow immune to chemicals.
And in the winter, at least before the machinery, we pick the cotton from their stalks.
Now I can't begin to imagine how many miles we have all walked,
up and back, up and back along these rows.

We walk alongside her.
The setting sun maintains a continuous pounding on our backs,
the humidity from the damp fields is warm, it rests on our shoulders like tired, sweaty arms.
She heads toward the irrigation ditch. 
The ditch is dirt, not cement, it is wide, muddy, and slippery.
The water is shallow.
I see my father's truck pulling up on the opposite side.
In the front seat there are women, and in the back, men.
The men wedge their feet in between plastic and aluminum irrigation pipes, mud-caked shovels, boots, and hoes.
Equipment in the back of his truck all for the purposes of working fields.
I remember the hoe he carried.
It was big, with a blade that held an edge well and got the work done.
I recall purchasing a hoe for my home and being particularly unsatisfied with the craftsmanship.
"They call this a hoe? I said to my husband. It had a skinny neck, and no blade to speak of.
The handle was too thin, causing blisters.
Once in awhile I look around for the type of hoe my father carried. I found one once, but didn't have money to buy it.

In slow motion,
weighed down by the heat,
the women begin to slide across the bench of the pickup truck.
They slowly step out of the cab, appearing as a single long strand of woman, emerging.
In cautious unison they walk toward the edge of the ditch.
My mother, as if connected to them by an invisible string,
is pulled toward them from the opposite side. 
Their movement is dreamlike. They peer into the muddy water.
And as if with a shared nervous system, their hands motion the towel each is carrying,
motion it to just above their eyes, covering their faces.
With a single vocal act they release from their depths a hard, deep, mournful wail.
This sound breaks the wave of bright summer light above the green cotton fields.





Deer Dance Exhibition
 

Question: Can you tell us about what he is wearing?
Well, the hooves represent the deer's hooves,
the red scarf represents the flowers from which he ate,
the shawl is for skin.
The cocoons make the sound of the deer walking on leaves and grass.
Listen.
Question: What is that he is beating on?
It's a gourd drum. The drum represents the heartbeat of the deer.
Listen.
When the drum beats, it brings the deer to life.
We believe the water the drum sits in is holy. It is life.
Go ahead, touch it.
Bless yourself with it.
It is holy. You are safe now.
Question: How does the boy become a dancer?
He just knows. His mother said he had dreams when he was just a little boy.
You know how that happens. He just had it in him.
Then he started working with older men who taught him how to dance.
He has made many sacrifices for his dancing even for just a young boy.
The people concur, "Yes, you can see it in his face.
Question: What do they do with the money we throw them?
Oh, they just split it among the singers and dancer.
They will probably take the boy to McDonald's for a burger and fries.
The men will probably have a cold one.
It's hot today, you know.





The Skyline of a Missing Tooth
 

1.
The ice hook untwists inside the whirlwind like a tail.

A raven's rib ripped from the electric socket
     heats the palm,
its rusted core bound by the apple's shaven hide.

Like a concussion cushioned between fingertips--
     egg batter congeals in cracks of concrete.

     The fourth generation of bees flee the unlocked mouth.

The stoplight blinks
midway between wing, beak, and worm
     unwinding inside braided corn husk,
     pulsing near the foot of the interrogator
          as he slams the gate shut.

The interrogator,
     Every atom belonging to him, says:
You there--hook and worm,
you there--carved pebbles tucked under the glacier,
your apathy grows like gray hair in these untied shoes.

The tundra's anvil and spine
     are flung back into the quarried pockets of the pilgrim.

The "safe feeling blossoms next to the caged wren.

Motor oil trickles from the harpooned log.

The Milky Way backbones the nervous system of the stream the deer sips.

This is where I broke the ice,

broke the sun's neck,
     and the city raised its sunflower above a pond of gathered lice. 

The storm took care of it!
Reached down, hammered them flat.
Walls erected, stoned down, down,
and as we fled,
     we unbraided our hair from the fan belt of the exhumed engine.

          One twin kissed the other in the uncovered wagon.


2.
We watched them unravel from their neckties,
and took the shape of rain clouds blotting out the noon sun.

In their houses--
          The long night gloved the mist inside our gills.

And I stained the plaques clean,
memorized each brick flung from the window,
     while roosters crowed the grip loose.

Who made them leap from shelves unnamed?
Made them buckle down low,
pulled out by their tails
     from between each lie cupped inside another one?

A spear was driven into it--
     Underneath the pilgrim's skirt:
          the skyline of a missing tooth.





Blues-ing on the Brown Vibe
 

I.
And Coyote struts down East 14th
feeling good
looking good
feeling the brown
melting into the brown that loiters
rapping with the brown in front of the Native American Health Center
talking that talk 
of relocation from tribal nation
of recent immigration to the place some call the United States
home to many dislocated funky brown

ironic immigration

more accurate tribal nation to tribal nation

and Coyote sprinkles corn pollen in the four directions
to thank the tribal people
          indigenous to what some call the state of California
          the city of Oakland
for allowing use of their land.

II.
And Coyote travels by Greyhound from Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA thru
Dintah
to Oakland, California, USA
laughing
Interstate 40 is cluttered with RVs from as far away as Maine
traveling and traveling
to perpetuate the myth
Coyote kicks back for most of the ride
amused by the constant herd of tourists
amazed by the mythic Indian they create

at a pit stop in Winslow
Coyote trades a worn beaded cigarette lighter for roasted corn
from a middle-aged Navajo woman squatting
in front of a store
 
and Coyote squats alongside the woman
talking that talk 
of bordertown blues
of reservation discrimination
 
blues-ing on the brown vibe
a bilagana snaps a photo
the Navajo woman stands
holding out her hand
requesting some of her soul back
instead
she replaces her soul with a worn picture of George Washington on a dollar bill
 
and Coyote starts on another ear of corn
climbing onto the Greyhound
the woman
still squatting
waiting 
tired of learning not to want
waits there for the return of all her pieces.

III.
And Coyote wanders
right into a Ponca sitting at the Fruitvale Bart station
next to the Ponca is a Seminole
Coyote struts up to the two
"Where ya'all from?
 
the Ponca replies
"Oooklahooma
pause
the Seminole silent watches a rush of people climb in and out of the train
headed for Fremont
the Seminole stretches his arms up and back stiff from the wooden benches
pause
he pushes his lips out toward the Ponca slowly gesturing that he too is from Oklahoma
Coyote wanders
"where 'bouts?
 
the Ponca replies
"Ponnca City
pause
the Seminole replies
"Seminoole
 
Coyote gestures to the Ponca
"You Ponca?
the Ponca nods his head in affirmation
Coyote nods his head in content
to the Seminole
Coyote asks
"You Seminole?
pause
the Seminole now watching some kids eating frozen fruit bars
nods his head
 
and Coyote shares his smokes with the two
and ten minutes later
they travel together on the Richmond train
headed for Wednesday night dinner at the Intertribal Friendship House.
 
IV.
And Coyote blues-ing on the urban brown funk vibe
wanders
in and out of existence 
tasting the brown
rusty at times
worn bitter from relocation.





Bringing Hannah Home
 

We brought Hannah home today
in afternoon sun with a crisp chill in the air
on a hill overlooking the bay.

Two women with a child and a shovel and a frozen placenta wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a red plastic bag.
Hannah was brought into this world
some say fourth others say fifth
five days before.
Before we brought her home.

The weekend of rain softened the earth
but the cold discouraged the shovel from denting more than the surface.
I dug into the earth.
The ground weakened beneath the strength I put into the shovel
pounding the ground
smooth and moist at first
then cold and solid.

Pounding the ground
warmed my arms.
I thought good thoughts for Hannah and her mother
and prayed for us all.
Remembering those who have passed on and those to be born
and I thought of my children to be born
and I thought of my father who has passed on.

Breaking into the cold ground
I thought of the day we brought my father home.
Dintah winter had frozen the ground
and the earth chipped like ice, slivers of crunchy cold beneath our feet.
Our bodies warmed by our work
and the earth chipped like an old tree being chopped, taking hours to finish.
Our bodies tired from our work
and the earth piled high beside the hole like the clouds and just as fluffy.
Our bodies natural returning to the ground. 

I dug into the ground
digging out earth that would nourish Hannah
digging out life that would embody Hannah
and soon a small hole appeared four feet deep.

There we stood
two women with a child and a shovel and a frozen placenta wrapped in aluminum foil placed in a red plastic bag.
The frozen mass of
tissue and blood and life
was placed in the small hole
by Hannah's mother
and I felt her heat
tissue and blood and life
squatting with bloodied hands and cold earth
bringing Hannah home.





Night Travel
 

I.
I like to travel to L.A. by myself
My trips to the crowded smoggy polluted by brown
indigenous and immigrant haze are healing.
I travel from one pollution to another.
Being urban I return to where I came from
My mother 
survives in L.A.
Now for over forty years.

I drive to L.A. in the darkness of the day
on the road before CHP
one with the dark
driving my black truck
invisible on my journey home.

The dark roads take me back to my childhood
riding in the camper of daddy's truck headed home.
My brother, sister and I would be put to sleep in the camper
and sometime in the darkness of the day
daddy would clime into the cab with mom carrying a thermos full of coffee and some Pendleton blankets
And they would pray
before daddy started the truck
for journey mercies.

Often I'd rise from my lullaby sleep and stare into the darkness of the road
the long darkness empty of cars
Glowy from daddy's headlights and lonesome from Hank Williams' deep and twangy voice singing of cold nights and cheatin' hearts.

About an hour from Flagstaff
the sun would greet us
and the harsh light would break the darkness
and we'd be hungry from travel and for being almost home.

II.
I know the darkness of the roads
endless into the glowy path before me
lit by the moon high above and the heat rising from my truck's engine.
The humming from tires whisper mile after mile
endless alongside roadside of fields shadowy from glow.

I know the darkness of the roads
It swims through my veins
dark like my skin
and silenced like a battered wife.
I know the darkness of the roads
It floods my liver
pollutes my breath
yet I still witness the white dawning.






When Roots Are Exposed
 

I.
The empty of stomach
manifests silence 
a stillness
that levels 
coffee in a cup
and in a respectful manner
allows steam to penetrate
the surface.
Reversal of action
has created my sandstone canyon
rooted cedar and sage at my feet.
This movement is where
a tranquility stems.

II.
When my child creates
bubbles through a soapy wand,
I occupy the action of fate
that bursts the perfect form.
A halcyon absorbed
nesting within
the existence of the form
that no longer exists.
The formless form
is where my mind floats.

III.
It is easy to give form
especially with English words
a promotion of mechanical ligaments
binding spirit with assembly-fabricated molds.
Just as my hair poses an appendage of my brain
my tongue poses an appendage of my heart.
I cannot classify this thought as a typewritten symbol.
An ideogram of essence
cultivates my stillness to action.







Addiction to the Dead
 

I lift my body one leg then another over the cold curve of
the claw-foot tub
Like a walking stick with a colossal cocoon attached
A beast and a mutant   I am this

Hooked on the steam of hot water I
Negotiate stretched skin   a sore spine   the splitting of imminent birth

What do you want

Mammoth   a domemoon stomach
Carved by spidery trails     former settlement

You in there   baby     think you're ready for this

Sing soprano notes   sing sounds of upness
Says the midwife
She says go ahead   smoke some marijuana   you see she's our
motherherb   sacred medicine   not for foolery and 
selfishness   never to be used in that other way you know
she works deeply niece   can take care those injuries
bad mister   wrecks   he set     snaring you
this medicine   will   show you    the things killing
all of us 

         ----------

This is what's necessary     I sustain you
You are not ready for me   what is out here
Cruel minds separate small girls from girlhood
Fists pound your brother's brains through the wall
Yellowdrunk eyes from a failed mind   lick every pair of
Breasts in the room
At home the smoke shop the wake the burial the ceremony the 
Indian-taco stand--

I'm done

         ----------

Just keep sleeping on my mucous pillow
And don't push on me

O     pouring bowls of light
I see the horrific truths
The most beautiful lie
Will never fool

Never fool
Never fool
The fool

         ----------

What will be the venting of this
Where will we be
How will the vault be lifted

A tinny sound     the drip of persistence
Water into water looking for its level
Always seeking level

No more a drip now a stream continuous motion
Unified atoms 
Pearls cells   threads cries

The house and early night are each black and black

One a lonesome gaping mouth    the other a safe place
To plan
The real fact of spirit leaving body

         ----------

You push to be born fully alive
You press my addiction to the dead world
Birth me out a muse

         ----------

Ancestors glide 
Landing on the levee where the DDT   petroleum  and tobacco
Burned my grandfathers's flesh    Emiliano    and fueled
My mother's resistance   Chata

Ancestors scold me     the lanky child running through
Glossy fields
Crabgrass Indian gum plants johnsongrass

Waxy from spraying    the continuous spraying 
O freedom of the green revolution     O  postwar
Stockpiles

O     fucking   inheritance   of the ethnic poor

O    how   we've     been    fucked

         ----------

I go through the window opening after opening
Memory buried upon memory      that's how this appears

Skins    burst   unseam     and inside these is me
A skinny dark girl with a dark brain and a dark mind

Seeking the deja-vu   Zone of Time Flow
Outside of fear

O   no one    can see me    or see what is real
The invasive spray seeping
Follows me and flows in my blood through decades

To my room and the ease of dark and sleep
Dreaming how I'll wage war on my raiders

O settlers of the empire
O land thieves
O scalpers of my grandfathers
O slave traders of my grandmothers

Books   stand like enemies
Rapists    who'll conspire to kill me
They wrestle me    I wrestle back   kicking their spines
Splitting their black seeds with my knife    the little
Black letters ejaculate from
Their splintered and crushed chaff

My uterus stops     the surging jolt of you     kicking
You will not miscarry
Not one more
Not ever again






Drinking under the Moon She Goes Laughing:
 

When the end was near
He threatened   hands trembling
There is no end    never    his hands reaching to my face
You can't leave   taking off his shirt   going for his pants
The trickle of sweat beading off his nose

Moon-orb spray   metallic shimmer     slicklove
Tripping numb night shadows
Crows perched on a streetlight

We're terrestrial ants living in fragility
On Huhugam sacred ground
Jar of our dead

Like ragged cats my ghosts and I
Gossip in the alley behind a bar
My eyes grasp theirs     a spark     revolution
Feet without tracks on gravel

Our existence erased   far off
From clinking beer bottles and vanity

On the bench outside a bookstore
We get erased    see the news of the street
Resistance getting milled

My favorite ghosts and I bear down harder    birth ourselves

On the bench outside a bookstore
Frigid wind wants to snatch our secrets

Hey nay ya na ya na ya na
I thank you thank you for your presence
My ghosts   I thank you for your presence
Hey nay ya na   ya na   ya na  ya na
This dilemma  oh ancestors
O! ancestors !!!!   I thank you  thank you  thank you
Hey nay ya na ya na ya na ya na

I'm still the Lipan Jumano land-grant mongrel
Nobody sees   nobody recognizes   an invisibility
Scudding through all the checkpoints
Border towns  train tracks  pesticide flybys   welfare lines

Wings shifting shape
Scorpion's venom injects me for the night

Green light spasms in the click click delete cut past
fucking do something  do something different

An orgasm of light at the slippery edge
One good time to die
And live spreading like osmosis

Tripping grandmother rabbit on the moon
Always with that sorrowful look on her face
Make the medicine
Be artistic
Do what is necessary





Song from a Reedless Flute
 

You are beadwork woven by a broken Indian woman
That I mend with cautious, needle-pricked fingers.
You are raw sweetness of burning chaga
Scraping my lungs and startling tears.
You are the bear claw necklace
No longer caressing
The space between my breasts.
You are cigarettes
That I quit years ago,
But sometimes smoke anyways.

You are maple syrup on snow
Melting on my tongue
Until I ache from the cold.
You are the cedar tree
Sheltering my childhood
From unwanted caresses.
You are the star blanket
Sliding off the bed on autumnal nights.
You are a stubborn braid of wiingashk
That must be relit with a dozen matches
Before it releases thin streamers of sweetness.

You are the love song
Played on a reedless flute
That only spirits hear.





I Will Take Anyone to Bed (Poetically Speaking of Course)
 

I have made love with Pablo Neruda
On the heights of Machu Picchu
I flashed the tattoo on my thigh 
And hitched a lowride with Luis Rodriguez
I have held Adrian Louis close
And danced a wild reservation two-step
Until beer cans and disposable diapers
Spun around us like stars.
I have surrendered to Leonel Rugama's
Burning adolescent heat
And caressed Roque Dalton
From a luxuriance of bed sheets and red wine.

I stayed up all night reading Sherman Alexie,
Nine months later, I gave birth to twin poems.

This lust is not heterosexual.
I devour Nikki Giovanni and Patricia Smith
Like Sao Tome chocolate.
I have been known to steal away for
An afternoon tryst with Julia de Burgos.
I wrap Nellie Wong around me like a silk robe.

Tonight, I have a date to share a steamy bath
With Linda Hogan and Joy Harjo
And it's gonna be gooooood . . .





Ghost Dance
 

Two hundred seventy
Ghost Dancers died dreaming
That humanity would drown
In a flood of White sins.

Then the renewed earth
Would reclaim city and town,
Leaving only Ghost Dancers
And those who lived by nature's laws.

History books say the threat is gone.
The Ghost Dance died with the ancestors--
Wovoka and his sacred dream
Were destroyed.

Each time it rains,
I go out to the sidewalk,
Where the tree roots
Have broken the concrete
Listening to the water's whispering:

"It is coming soon.





Lineage
 

My grandmothers were strong. 
They followed plows and bent to toil.
They moved through fields sowing seed.
They touched earth and grain grew.
They were full of sturdiness and singing.
My grandmothers were strong.

My grandmothers are full of memories
Smelling of soap and onions and wet clay
With veins rolling roughly over quick hands
They have many clean words to say.
My grandmothers were strong.
Why am I not as they?





Betrayal
 

They decide finally not to speak 
of it, the one blemish in their otherwise 
blameless marriage. It happened 
 
as these things do, before the permanence 
was set, before the children grew 
complicated, before the quench 
 
of loving one another became all 
each of them wanted from this life. 
Years later the bite 
 
of not knowing (and not wanting 
to know) still pierces the doer 
as much as the one to whom it was done: 
 
the threadbare lying, the insufferable longing, 
the inimitable lack of touching, the undoing 
undone.





Conversation 4: On Place
 

I sit in my own shadow, she says, the way my mother gave birth to it. In artificial light, blinds drawn against the darkness of power.  I think of you as if you were that shadow, a natural enclosure, a world, not a slight, so I can wander through your darkness. Has our contract inverted time, made our universe contract, a cramped bed for two? And when I say your name, do I draw water, a portrait, curtain, bridge, or conclusion?Place there is none, he quotes. Not even to hang up our archetypes. Let alone Star-Spangled Banners. We go forward and backward, and there is no place. Therefore it is a name for God. My eye, steadfast on traffic lights, abolishes the larger part of the round world. I should look at my feet. Space sweeps through us, a hell of distances bathed in the feeble glow of emptiness. Outward mobility, unimpeded. Suddenly we're nobody home, without any need of inattention, imposture, or talent for deceit.The wind whips my skin as if it were water, she says. My skin is water. For wind read wind, news, sky falling. Is it a mental disturbance or the higher math of love if I hear you talking under my breath and from the torn fragments assume the sun is far away and small, and a look can cause a burn? Superstition, too, is a kind of understanding, and to forgo it may have consequences.Clusters of possibilities whiz through our head, he says. Electric charges, clogged highway, screeching brakes, a house too full of guests. With grounds for disagreement and miscarriage. The light rushes in dry, screaming. But the opaque parts of the nerve oppose the noise and void the options. Then the project must be prolonged in terms of lack.





Conversation 9: On Varieties of Oblivion
 

          
          After bitter resistance the river unravels into the night, he says. Washes our daily fare of war out into a dark so deaf, so almost without dimension there is no word to dive from. Body weight displaced by dreams whose own lack promises lucidity so powerful it could shoot a long take to mindlessness. Fish smell travels the regions of sleep, westward like young men and the dawn. Then I return, too early to bring anything back, unsure of what I want, terrified I'll fail, by a hair, to seize it. We talk because we can forget, she says. Our bodies open to the dark, and sand runs out. Oblivion takes it all with equal tenderness. As the sea does. As the past. Already it suffuses the present with more inclusive tonalities. Not orchestrating a melodic sequence, but rounding the memory of a rooster on top a hanging silence. Or injured flesh. Impersonal. Only an animal could be so.  An avatar of the holy ghost, he chuckles. Or the angel of the annunciation beating his wings against a door slammed shut. Behind it, love already plays the organ. Without the angel. He is invisible because we have rejected his message.On the old photos, she says, I see a stranger staking out my skin. As if an apple could fall too far from the tree. Yet I call her "me, "my years of furtively expanding flesh, with almost-certainty. It's a belief that seems exempt from doubt, as if it were the hinge on which my doubts and questions turn. Still, I may seem the same "I to you while I've already rolled it through the next door. From left to right.





Conversation 12: On Hieroglyphs
 

          
          Champollion fainted, she says, once he had wrested their secret from the hieroglyphs and saw them turn transparent. The serpent no longer with power to strike, but biting its tail. I smell my salts, my packets of words, panicked. I'm no longer sure whether they shape my reality or have too little mass to interact with naked matter. Then they would pass right through the earth as I will in death.The lightest particles gather the energy, he says, and given their density, outweigh stars. Thought follows thought, the interval calibrated on the space between your legs. Your yes fire, your no the crack of a whip. Well, more a filament breaking in a lightbulb. Eating from the Tree of Knowledge can't be undone. Only muddied, as by motivation. And the way you thrust out your belly as you walk, with almost shameless indifference, makes a void in the air, but no case for cosmic deceleration.  So even if I despair of plane surfaces, she says, writing, even talking, becomes an act of faith that my bondage to grammar and lexicon is not in vain. That these symbols in their beautiful and hallucinatory nudity blind me only to make me see. There is fire under the smoke. The sun also rises and falls.We still read at risk, he says, but we don't need to lard the crocodile with arrows. The picture won't devour us. It is swallowed in the fluid agreements between gonads and frontal lobe at a rate relative to the dark closing in. Yet two speeds in paroxysm need not mesh. A burning heart, failing to strike while hot, may not save the burning feet.
        




Conversation 23: On Cause
 

          
          I step into my mother's room, she says, and though a woman's body is a calendar of births and injunctions to death, time disappears. Only dead enough to bury could prove sound to silence or the anxiety I know by heart and lung. In my mother's room. The tie between us anticipates any move to sever it. Terror and lack of perspective. The river runs clear without imparting its clarity, whether we step into it or not.Deep in the bones, he says. If a butterfly fluttering its wings in China can cause a storm in Rhode Island, how much more the residues of radiation, family resemblance and past rituals. The stove glows red. Thin apple trees line the road. You think you are taking a clean sheet of paper, and it's already covered with signs, illegible, as by child's hand.  The heart has its rhythm of exchange, she says, without surplus or deficit. Mine murmurs your name while conjugating precise explosions with valves onto the infinite. I take it down with me, in the body, to develop in a darkroom of my own. They way the current elongates our reflection in the river and seems to carry it off.A death without corruption is the promise of photography, he says. Focus and light meter translating a cut of flesh into a tense past laughing its red off. But the film's too clear. Even if smudged with fingerprints. Even if the light falls into the arms of love.





Kin
 

When news came that your mother'd
smashed her hip, both feet caught
in rungs of the banquet table,
our wedding rebroken on the memory
of the long lake of silence
when the stones of her body
broke as an Irish fence of stones,
I saw your wet dugs drag
with the weight of our daughter
in the quick of her sleep
to another feeding;
then the shoulders dropped
their broken antenna branches
of fear at the knife
running the scars
which had been born into the colon
for the misspent enema,
the clubbed liver unclean
with the stones of the gall bladder,
and the broken arch of hip
lugging you to the lake,
the dough inner tube of lading
swollen with innerpatching.

I pick you up from the floor
of your ringing fears, the floor
where the photographs you have worked
into the cool sky of the gray you love,
and you are back at the compost pile
where the vegetables burn,
or swim in the storm of your childhood,
when your father egged you on with his
open machinery, the exhaust choking your sisters,
and your sisters choked still.

Now this voice stops you in accusation,
and the years pile up on themselves
in the eggs of your stretched sons,
one born on his birthday, both dead.
I pull you off into the sanctuary
of conciliation, of quiet tactics,
the uttered question, the referral,
which will quiet the condition you have seen
in your mother's shadow, the crutches
inching in the uncut grass,
and the worn body you will carry
as your own birthmark of his scream.





Makin Jump Shots
 

He waltzes into the lane
 'cross the free-throw line,
fakes a drive, pivots,
floats from the asphalt turf
in an arc of black light,
and sinks two into the chains.

One on one he fakes
down the main, passes
into the free lane
and hits the chains.

A sniff in the fallen air--
he stuffs it through the chains
riding high:
"traveling someone calls--
and he laughs, stepping
to a silent beat, gliding 
as he sinks two into the chains.





Rite
 

Vodu green clinching his waist,
obi purple ringing his neck,
Shango, God of the spirits,
whispering in his ear,
thunderlight stabbing the island
of blood rising from his skull.

Mojo bone in his fist
strikes the sun from his eye.
Iron claw makes his wrist.
He recalls the rites of strength
carved upon his chest.
Black flame, like tongues of glass,
ripples beneath a river of sweat.

Strike the island!
Strike the sun!
Strike the eye of evil!
Strike the guilty one!

No power can stay the mojo
when the obi is purple
and the vodu is green
and Shango is whispering,
Bathe me in blood.
I am not clean.






Son of Msippi
 

Up
from Msippi I grew.
(Bare walk and cane stalk
make a hungry belly talk.)
Up
from the river of death.
(Walk bare and stalk cane
make a hungry belly talk.)

Up
from Msippi I grew.
Up
from the river of pain.

Out of the long red earth dipping, rising,
spreading out in deltas and plains,

out of the strong black earth turning
over by the iron plough,

out of the swamp green earth dripping
with moss and snakes,

out of the loins of the leveed lands
muscling its American vein:
the great Father of Waters,
I grew
up,
beside the prickly boll of white,
beside the bone-filled Mississippi
rolling on and on,
breaking over,
cutting off,
ignoring my bleeding fingers.

Bare stalk and sun walk
I hear a boll-weevil talk
cause I grew 
up
beside the ox and the bow,
beside the rock church and the shack row,
beside the fox and the crow,
beside the melons and maize,
beside the hound dog,
beside the pink hog,
flea-hunting,
mud-grunting,
cat-fishing,
dog pissing
in the Mississippi
rolling on and on,
ignoring the colored coat I spun
of cotton fibers.

Cane-sweat river-boat
nigger-bone floating.

Up from Msippi
I grew,
wailing a song with every strain.

Woman gone woe man too
baby cry rent-pause daddy flew.

Love Song
 

Beloved,
I have to adore the earth:

The wind must have heard
your voice once.
It echoes and sings like you.

The soil must have tasted 
you once.
It is laden with your scent.

The trees honor you
in gold
and blush when you pass.

I know why the north country 
is frozen.
It has been trying to preserve
your memory.

I know why the desert
burns with fever.
It was wept too long without you.

On hands and knees,
the ocean begs up the beach,
and falls at your feet.

I have to adore
the mirror of the earth.
You have taught her well
how to be beautiful.






The Zebra Goes Wild Where the Sidewalk Ends
 

I
Neon stripes tighten my wall
where my crayon landlord hangs
from a bent nail.

My black father sits crooked
in the kitchen
drunk on Jesus' blood turned 
to cheap wine.

In his tremor he curses
the landlord who grins
from inside the rent book.

My father's eyes are
bolls of cotton.

He sits upon the landlord's 
operating table,
the needle of the nation
sucking his soul.

II
Chains of light race over
my stricken city.
Glittering web spun by
the white widow spider.

I see this wild arena 
where we are harnessed
by alien electric shadows.

Even when the sun washes
the debris
I will recall my landlord
hanging in my room
and my father moaning in
Jesus' tomb.

In America all zebras
are in the zoo.

I hear the piston bark
and ibm spark:
let us program rabies.
the madness is foaming now.

No wild zebras roam the American plain.
The mad dogs are running.
The African zebra is gone into the dust.

I see the shadow thieves coming
and my father on the specimen table.






Kef 12
 

Take up the blood from the grass, sun.
Take it up.
These people do not thirst for it.
Take up the insect children that play in
the grass, sun.
Take them away.
These people are sick of them.
Take down the long slender reeds, sun.
Cut them down.
These people cannot make flutes any longer.
Now sun, come closer to the earth!
Even closer than that.
Closer. Now, sun.
Take away the shape from the metal, sun.
They are like stone, these people.
Now make them lava.





Kef 21
 

          
          First there was the earth in my mouth. It was there like a running stream, the July fever sweating the delirium of August, and the green buckling under the sun. The taste of sick dust ran in the currents of saliva which I heaved up and tried to picture when all the people would curse their own stinking guts and die. No. I am not wishing that everyone should die. Nor am I wishing that everyone should be still. Only I am squeezing out the steam in me.
        




Kef 24

the salve trade
 

all down on perdido street, from san juan

to inglewood, up on that bridge, up where the
soul trees grow by soul, dance to fantastic
information while we kick off the modern world.

the whistle sounded good like a kiss on a train.

a track below us in the cabinet in the tunnel

under the water. a steady boom to lift us out.
nobody lived, not without digging, but he wore


that ivory waistcoat and we loved to see that shit.

I love my people too much to be around them
at school. I slip underneath the cinema tree, move myself
in half, dance to fray, write a paper on the salve trade.


the big fat women and the heliocopters they bring

with them to watch them and their kids. whole long-

cotton sewn into the coat of the one
who clothes me. before I started clothing

them with paper. before cotton sewn into


their coats they curled up on flat boats
all the way back up the country. the beaded
strips of leather and cotton made me come
to myself when he called me and wrote me


on the one who clothes me. pour some water
on me. make coming matter cut and twirl

on me. the law of emulsion is always broke
on me. somebody pour some beautiful jute

on me. let her blow some horn on me. the man
who clothes me in my skin is gonna write

someday they're gonna curve this on a pearl

to get up out from here. it's simple to stay furled

The Coffins
 

Two days into the flood 
they appear, moored against 
a roof eave or bobbing caught 
in the crowns of drowned trees. 
Like fancy life boats 
from an adventurer's flag ship, 
brass plating and grips, 
walnut sheen, scroll work, 
they slip through the understory 
on this brief, bad river. 
What have they discovered 
and come back to account? 
Or is this the beginning 
of the marvelous voyage 
and they plan never to return?





It Is Enough to Enter
 

the templar 
halls of museums, for

example, or 
the chambers of churches, 

and admire 
no more than the beauty 

there, or 
remember the graveness

of stone, or 
whatever. You don't 

have to do any
better. You don't have to

understand 
the liturgy or know history 

to feel holy
in a gallery or presbytery. 

It is enough
to have come just so far. 

You need 
not be opened any more 

than does 
a door, standing ajar.

Even Be It Built of Boards Planed by Hand  and Joined Without Nails, Yet May a Barn Burn
 

The three men now stood satisfied, arms crossed, 
joking among themselves, but only moments before 
they hadn't been laughing. It had taken all three 
to bind the struggling man. First, to limit his movement, 
they had duct-taped his wrists together behind his back: 
for that, one man had held his legs and another had pinned him, 
one hand on each shoulderblade and one knee on his head, 
at his left temple, grinding his right cheek and eye into 
the dust and straw and dried shit that formed the floor of the barn. 
First they bound his wrists, then his ankles. Then it got easier. 
More tape over his mouth, wound all the way around his head, 
three full loops, much more than was necessary, which was one thing 
they were laughing about, the two bigger men making fun 
of the smaller one, who had done that part of the binding. 
Then they'd bound him down on the mattress, again with the tape.

The bound man continued to struggle, but once the tape 
denied him movement he felt as if he were thinking clearly, 
as if his panic had lifted, resistance become 
mere obligation. He thought surely the tape would run out, 
but they had another roll, just in case. He noticed 
the new order--head first this round--when it came to the mattress. 
One man would lift one end just off the dirt, enough 
for another to wrap the tape, which cursed coming off the roll 
in what the man construed as sympathy, all the way 
around the mattress in loops that included his head and neck, 
then the same process at the other end, 
all the way around the mattress and his ankles.

They couldn't figure how to get the tape around his torso 
because it was so near the middle of the mattress. 
The bound man found himself wanting to help, but of course 
he couldn't speak, and anyway they didn't need his advice. 
His hands bound behind his back and against the mattress meant 
his feet and head, and most of all his neck, were plenty 
to keep him from getting loose and grabbing one of their guns.

The bound man's life didn't pass before him in summary, 
exactly, but he did see things now that in all these years 
he hadn't noticed. The wiring, for instance. 
He thought it must have been his own father who'd wired the barn 
with that odd blend of pride and makeshift half-competence 
that showed up in all his father'd made, himself not least. 
One bare bulb bragging from the highest joist 
about its white porcelain fixture, but better, really, 
at casting long shadows than at lighting the place, 
though if the three men would just leave him alone, he thought, 
he'd be able to count up all the birds' nests and speculate 
on where swallows had built before there were barns. 
The wire ran from switchbox to fixture in straight lines 
and right angles, through half-inch galvanized surely intended 
for plumbing but good, too, for frustrating the rats.

It was the short man, the one who'd done all the taping, who then 
poured kerosene across the mattress and over the man, 
soaking his clothes, making sure to splash some into his eyes. 
No one else noticed, but he spelled out fuck with the kerosene. 
Or anyway swung his arms in that pattern. That was when 
they could relax a little, the three men, and start their joking, 
once the kerosene was poured. One tall man slapped his forehead: 
"You brought matches, right? "Matches? the other replied, 
furrowing his brow and patting his pockets, 
and both laughed out loud. Even the short man smiled.

Barns burn, it turns out, just the way you'd think 
if you thought about it, hay fast and hot, 
siding lighting the roof and the flooring of the loft, 
all the slender strips of wood, with the few parts not tinder--
the frame, the beams and joists--starting last and lasting longest. 
But that's not what the mattress-bound man's great-great-grandfather 
had thought about, its someday burning, as he built the barn. 
He had a daughter to worry about, and a wife 
big with what he thought might be a boy. And weather, 
and a dozen cows. Plenty to fret more immediate 
than which fuck-up would later taint his bloodline 
and preside over the decay, finally 
inviting the sacrifice, of what he had built to last.

Barns burn like bonfires built for the burning, 
stacked just so by one mortal for the next. 
They burn best at night, whether or not communicants 
travel up and down billows lit silver from above, 
red from below. And whether or not three men 
have stopped among sycamores on the rise just opposite 
and turned for a moment to admire their handiwork.

am cooling because nothing 
touches me.

Others may go to the petting zoo
and country fair
but don't even tell me what they touch

there. I'm taking my temperature again; 
my thermometer is digital and pink
and its beep is my name

being read from the book of life,
which is available on Kindle 
and allows me to avoid the public library

but contains peculiar punctuation
errors and is transcribed by
evangelists while they wait 

in line at gates you can't see from here. 98.5. 
Still cooler than life. I have another 
glass of water, and feel you turning in me,

my little book, flipping over and over,
it's time for bed little sow, little sow.
The book of death is open on my bedside

table and is called The Pregnancy
Countdown, and contains "advice from the
trenches about how to level

the enemy the body.
It's time for bed, little bee, little bee. I open my window
and find ten dead between the pane and the screen

which apparently has tears big enough
to enter and I leave them in state
in a pile and watch

the wind lift their
mighty wings in deathly
aspiration. It is the beginning

of flu season, Rosh Hashanah.
Every tear is recorded. I say tear
to rhyme with the chair by my window, 

not tear to rhyme with the fear of God
here at the Fair of God  
where the just

leer at the milk cow
and brush up against
captivity and slaughter

in the name of zoonosis
and the vector. Nothing touches me, 
little scale, little scale

I will not be meted I will
not give the mosquito 
her share even though the blood meal

is all she has to nurture her eggs
and mother to mother I hear
her flight even as she's drawn

to my breath by fate and nature,
which are one and as interchangeable
as babies in soap operas. Dangerous angel, 

I will not lie down 
with the lamb who is
contagious. I will not

hear your name recalled for I
have not named you and fear
tempers my love of the letters

of this world which are as 
pins through the body
while the wings flail, but I 

will not fail to meet you
when you get here
with your shadow

attached and your 
failure a promise
entering the success

of your first breath. On what
grounds, on what faith,
dare we aspire

together where Legion
hears the ventilator
and enters the wire?






Farming Family, 1912
 


"Farming Family, 1912," by August Sander

The cruelty of the men when they're alone,
The women's tiredness and resignation,
Do not get multiplied, as you'd expect,
When the extended families collect,
One day a year, to get their pictures taken.
It's not that any of their faces soften,
Nor that there's any obvious affection
Between the farmer's mother and his son;
And only an idealist could see
In this brief cutting from the family tree
A symbol of the strength of rootedness--
Three generations dwelling in one place--
Knowing how soon the root will lose its branch,
Cut down and hacked to pieces in a trench.
The only explanation that makes sense
For the illusion of resilience
That lights their eyes and makes them look at home
Is that with every added generation
Buried potentialities appear:
The son who poses strumming his guitar
Refutes his father's brandished Iron Cross
No more convincingly than his bare face
Proves that his father's beard is obsolete;
Denying one another, they complete
Their likeness to the contradictory
God who commanded us to multiply
So He could manifest, in every birth,
Another of His attributes on earth.





Kinetics Researcher from Vienna, 1930
 


"Kinetics Researcher from Vienna [Max Thun-Hohenstetin], 1930," by August Sander

 Nakedness ought to be undatable,
Proof that the latest phenotype is made
On the same plan as his original
Who sauntered through the Garden, unafraid.

Even without the cotton pouch he wears
As a concession to the prudery
Of viewers not evolved enough to share
His unembarrassed objectivity,

The willed detachment on his face would show,
Better than any clothes, the difference
Between the antique innocence that knows
No shame, and cultivated shamelessness.





The Woman of Progressive Intellect, 1914
 


"The Woman of Progressive Intellect (Intellectural), 1914," by August Sander

If it were not for her enlightened eyes,
She'd be the witch that intellect denies
Has ever walked the earth: the sunken jaw,
The blunt chin like a claw-toothed hammer's claw,
The stubbed and crooking finger, and the skin
As stained and crinkly as her crinoline,
Would make a loving grandchild run away.
It takes another kind of love to see
How spirit, in its tactical withdrawal
From aging outworks that are doomed to fall,
Consents to the bewitching of its shell
As long as it can hold the citadel
Where the progressive intellect has spent
A lifetime plotting the enlightenment
The backward and the beautiful dismiss
As mind's revenge for its unloveliness.






Homage to John Frederick Peto
 

                                   1

Fitfully in pictures disappearing now,
They are not toys but, rather, tiny horses
In the parade of youth: polish, spit, and display
In fire companies throughout our country.

All in green we went out rioting.
Lute music damasked the commercial radio,
And girls knew everything.
Old friend, I remember your first wife.
She brought a loom into our world.
We turned the music up to drown its sound.

Now I am face down in a disappearing picture.
I would know Christina Rossetti in a minute but not you.
Such is my skill set,
Blazon of a pathos soon abandoned.


                                   2

Muted extraordinary radiance,
Complicated if not impeded
By many things, most of them
In heaps where stone is stone,
Where wood is wood at close range,
Makes a fair portion of mind at midday
In desert mountains hard against my home.

Any ornaments for the poor man's store?
Any moments of leisure at the fish-house door?
I could show you rain just before the rain
And a black dog sniffing earthquake.
We die. Our children do not know us. We die.
I pray real prayers to a star too old
To climb these mountains up into the blue.


                                   3

A loop of string in the free space otherwise,
And no, and more beautiful to see indigo
Buntings taking back the sky to me.

Littleness sometimes even resembling sunlight
Overflows with colors, with intervals
Like wingspans the wind drills of a Sunday.

To enter a flower is to find a child
Not one's own unharmed.
Our Lucie has a loop of string.

Time will come again to talk perfection,
A succession of creatures in midair.
I won't be there.

I've been given back the sky that was gone:
Five colors of rain, five new colors.


                                   4

Haphazard constellation of midges and old flowers
Blows through the garden shambles as slowly as the sun,
Vision somehow keeping time with itself so vision
Shows the kindness of a moment to the man
Seated beside roses planted here by his own hand
In the shade of a first heaven and the quick confidence
Of his humanity's evanescent song.

Creation's a funny word.
I think of noises rounding a corner
Becoming names, and then a child for each
Of the names climbs down the sun.
Creation's the soul of haphazard.
I was old. I was young. I was old again.
Anymore Johnny, all I feel is fine.






The Word
 

The word comes along out of the mountain every once in awhile to chill me.

Undercurrent of an unwillingness to believe all 

is well in early spring beside a molten river riven by sun,

its loud hush and glug through leafless aspens split by a gravel bar's pulled switch.

A bull trout with fluorescent red dorsal fin eddies in a pool 

between a sloughed-off root clump and caved-in grassy bank.

Last year's downed trees, slash piles, busted garden gate.

Heed me and hear my loneliness. Split by a desire to be known 

by a crowd of solitaires and by one word split. 

A raven falls out of the yellow flame of a willow.

Its wings purely black buff sunlight. 

It paces the gravel bar, lifts into westerly sun. 

Wing flash. Black luster. Gone.

It is hope that tricks. Belief that when this now shines,

this now shines with or without us. Then why

scribble the veery's mid-morning marshal song? 

Soon Rick will arrive to help burn wood piles:

gasoline newspaper cedar shakes to start the blaze 

in this emptiness searching for godwords.

The ones God hears when priests without shoes 

without socks with their shawls stretched over their heads

arms out make forts of light. Their backs to the congregation,

their faces toward the ark, they rock. 

Their white wings so pure that this now is no more than then

with its barbells of silence, with its task of burning. 






Psalm
 

With coals of juniper, Lord, with ripped willow clumps,
with lodge-pole pine and fir, with wind-wrack and slash,
I kindle an all-night fire to mirror You.
No longer waning, no longer falsifying chimes.
No longer smoking out rot, or eclipsing Yeshiva scholars.
No Lord I know what is within magnified.
Stars will just have to wait to eddy through gates of night.
Little swirl, mimicking nebulae, mimicking galaxies, which turns 
for no apparent reason other than to cast and recast the whole
as it whirs and whirls, knocks and ticks at three am
in a snit to proclaim itself not as You but it in You. 
If I can strut a note, can rack wobbly pins, 
balance rocks into signposts, waves into a grass mass or two,
it will hear itself structuring time. This oddly chopped 
watched dimension quarters us into early middle late.
Each day scans and wanes, some hope knowing its moaning 
is mourning what it erases. The and stamped by the sea 
each second. Be with it and what it erases ceases to toll.






The Fall of 1992
 

Gainesville, Florida
An empire of moss,
          dead yellow, and carapace:
that was the season
          of gnats, amyl nitrate, and goddamn
rain; of the gator in the fake lake rolling

his silverish eyes;
          of vice; of Erotica,
give it up and let
          me have my way. And the gin-soaked dread
that an acronym was festering inside.

Love was a doorknob
          statement, a breakneck goodbye--
and the walk of shame
          without shame, the hair disheveled, curl
of Kools, and desolate birds like ampersands...

I re-did my face
          in the bar bathroom, above
the urinal trough.
          I liked it rough. From behind the stall,
Lady Pearl slurred the words: Don't hold out for love.






Straight Razor
 

He slid the stiff blade up to my ear:
Oh, fear,

this should have been thirst, a cheapening act.
But I lacked,

as usual, the crucial disbelief. Sticky, cold,
a billfold

wet in my mouth, wrists bound by his belt,
I felt

like the boy in a briny night pool, he who found
the drowned

body, yet still somehow swam with an unknown joy.
That boy.






Song
 

I found my muster station, sir.
My skin is patent leather.
The tourists are recidivists.
This calm is earthquake weather.

I've used up all the mulligans.
I'd kill to share a vice.
The youngster reads a yellowed Oui.
The socialite has lice.

The Europe trip I finally took
was rash and Polaroid,
was gilt, confit, and bathhouse foam.
And I cannot avoid

the end: I will not die in Paris,
won't rest for good behind
a painted mausoleum door.
The purser will not find

me mummified beneath your tulle,
and Paris will not burn.
Today is Thursday, so I'll die.
Come help me pick my urn.






Ballad in A
 

A Kansan plays cards, calls Marshall
a crawdad, that barb lands that rascal a slap;  
that Kansan jackass scats, 
camps back at caballada ranch.

Hangs kack, ax, and camp hat. 
Kansan's nag mad and rants can't bask,
can't bacchanal and garland a lass, 
can't at last brag can crack Law's balls,

Kansan's cantata rang at that ramada ranch, 
Maana, Kansan snarls, I'll have an armada
and thwart Law's brawn,
slam Law a damn mass war path.

Marshall's a marksman, maps Kansan's track, 
calm as a shaman, sharp as a hawk,
Says: That dastard Kansan's had
and gnaws lamb fatback.

At dawn, Marshall stalks that ranch,
packs a gat and blasts Kansan's ass
and Kansan gasps, blasts back.
A flag flaps at half-mast.






Our Jim
 

In this world hacked from marrowed dust,
the half-breed assassin slays 
men before they breed to corps,
He belts his innard song.

He travels to a sapling town where
sawyers hew logs to songs of plovers,
and mansadors tame broncs of the blackest, 
lustiest blood. 

Soon the town blooms to terror,
and fades before it booms.
Ghosts weed out of bodies with their sharp 
imagined hands.

A hobbled miner, delirious from the sun,
feels the shadow of his innard song, 
and croaks: I'm a buck nun 
failure anyway.

The half-breed leaves him be,
rides to a town of tents wooled with alfalfa
and glass-needled rain shatters
the dusted tundra.






Thin Place
 

White ash,
you wait for me

as I will wait
for someone.

What but skin
feels the wind,

what darkness
makes distinctions?

Breaking down
dusk and dawn,

housewreckers
on horse scaffolds

syncopate 
their hammers.

Brick dust
drifts like smoke,

tents of habitation
withdrawn,

hinges of habit
undone.






Static
 

Zipping your skirt, you rustle past,
sand hissing through a glass,
with the Bedouin snap and flash
of static-electric
sparks disturbing fabric.
This morning's charge could rouse
The Desert Fathers of Sinai
over which I drowse.






Gilgamesh
 

i

We lived on a lake with Muscovy ducks.
Interior decorators flush with furniture plans, 
the ducks thrust with the thrust of youth.



ii


We met at the gay community center, called Compass,
in Lake Worth, where they sponsored "The Coming Out Group,
with Forest, our skilled leader. Transsexuals met before.
You were fifty, I thirty-nine--
somewhat late to begin a life together for the first time;
we had begun to see announcements in the New York Times,
so we knew it was possible to print:
"Paul O'Shaughnessy and Spencer Reece were joined on a celery green love-seat . . .
Five years we had, not forever, but something still.



iii


Our consent took a long time. 
There were lulls. We played Scrabble: 
I arranged the tiles and you kept score.
Sometimes we rolled the dice and read the I Ching.
We went about our days unseen and we loved that.
I placed too many books against the walls--
Capote, Madame Bovary, a biography of Anne Boleyn. 
You complained about the clutter.
"Where will guests put their suitcases? you asked.
Sometimes, we squabbled about money.
Often, you stretched out upon the double bed,
your skin no longer young, pebbled, freckled, known by me.



iv


The city was jammed under your nails from construction work,
callused hands that knew bar-joists. Yours was an Irish body 
formed and punished by the tin-colored rains around Croagh Patrick.
Beyond you, manatees, scarred by propellers,
huddled in the power plant's warm waters.
Palm fronds and their shadows shook wildly as pornography.



v


On the edges of our dreams was the sea,
which the moon walked across with soft footsteps.



vi


Our dog, a Lab-mix named Butch, chewed a bone at your bare feet.
Butch moved like a shadow on the sea's floor.
Big and black, he came to us abused--
who does such a thing and why is it permanent?
We fed him a daily Xanax tablet before he pulled us
on his manic journeys that had no arrivals.



vii


When we visited your Aunt Annie in the nursing home,
her walker dominated the room like an empty kennel.
She did not know who I was, her senility rendering me oblique.
Long ago, when your mother died, 
your father sent a letter and a photograph of the four children to Killeen, 
asking Aunt Annie to come. As she strove across the sea,
she watched the Connemara ponies disappear,
then Knock, Letterfrack, Roundstone, and Cashel Bay blurred,
blurred and blurred until they were nothing but green.
She left Ireland for good and raised you 
and your three sisters--Joan, Ann, and Maureen. 
In America, she went about her days unseen.
On her day off, she lit four candles for each one of you
at the Shrine of St. Anthony on Arch Street, in Boston.
She never married. She adored you. 
When we visited, she kept saying:
"Paul, Paul, I have to get the cows across the stream.



viii


We overlooked Pelican Lake in Juno Beach
where caregivers and patients from the Alzheimer's Support Group
awkwardly commenced their semi-detached dates,
eating potato chips off paper plates
and feeding their broken bits to the ducks.
Eyes vacantly connected in Florida,
where born-agains with failed marriages sent pamphlets
to Jews so they could be saved by Christ:
to conquer and subdue was what Florida was for.
There, we napped while the ducks strutted and preened
with greasy black-green plumes and speckled red pates;
it looked like they had mashed crayons on their heads--
a sort of evolutionary mishap. Developers demanding more room,
the ducks were sated, companioned, unbundling with poop.


ix


A retired couple volunteered, 
instructing residents in the tango--
the lady had white stained tights, the man a tambourine.
The tango emoted from a boom box
as the residents gathered in a crescent moon of wheelchairs.
Aunt Annie watched and talked about her cows, the stream. 
We stood behind her like groomsmen.
Out the windows, Boston pontificated.



x


You were distracted, distracted
until one day you said, "I do not desire you.
You had always been honest.
You wanted a younger man, between twenty and twenty-five.
The day blued around us--
our book of changes came to a close.
Your Christ-kiss issued no more.
You were what you had always been, only more so--
Irish and unavailable, darling.



xi


The horizon became a handsaw. 
When I could not reach what I loved the world was rent.



xii


A friend had a stillborn, and her marriage ended.
She did not name the infant.
I had coffee with her at the Greek restaurant we liked.
She talked about going back to teach at Dreyfoos, the arts high school,
and one student, in particular, an effeminate male
with acne who dreamt of Julliard, a way out.
Florida luxuriated out the window--
the fire bush, the cornflower blue plumbago, the Mexican petunia.
I sold my library, my piano. I boarded a train.
Seagulls diminished, gray specks, gray motes.
The therapist in Fort Lauderdale made no more appointments for us.
The migrant day laborers 
out in Pahokee and Canal Point on Lake Okeechobee gleaned 
and went about their days unseen.
The orange groves' fragile hemispheres wobbled on their stems.
Sugar cane fields burned. Electrical poles gleamed.
Buck hoists and bucket trucks broke through the possum's sedge.
The Everglades sighed its nervous extinction.



xiii


Aunt Annie had lost her index finger in Coventry, during the Blitz.
Repeatedly, she rubbed the stump.



xiv


Perhaps you walk now there with your young men,
meaty St. Augustine grass under your feet,
moving discreetly, undetected, perhaps you speak of dissatisfactions,
of politics. The Atlantic narrowing to a flushed, sanguine strip,
the fishing boats alone in the dark, murmuring, 
hooking, perhaps the young men love you at first sight 
and plead with you to stay. I95 and a1a pulsing down 
Palm Beach County's spits like blood, perhaps 
your face tightens tenderly in response to what you see.






rotten oasis
 

Treachery abounds, look
inwards! Your bird jangles its small
swing. You're getting sleepy, very 
sleepy. In a vulnerable tyranny.
Leave for now the marksmen to 
their desolations, they ruin everyday
life. & luck can't do anything
about the undying devotion of
the undead, putting their backs
to the bus shelter while 
crumbs still stick to the dishes.
I guess someone is a king of France & apart
from whom nobody is a king of France. Same
rockstar, different poem. I like icons
& the toxic halos of figureheads, I like
to beat people up & rehash among the swan.
I was born in captivity, having 
fucked the right people, thick
in the France of it. The uniform you
design may still be stripped & not in
some pleasant mannerism. I guess treachery
abounds & scruple keys the addresses
out of their shining wrappers. I guess gin
relieves the need for whiskey, I guess I
can think as well as talk. Come to 
think of it, I spoke to your exo-
skeleton. It had been
sacked for cribbing a back salary
from your stunt double. I watched 
you chewing & the human body
is a great mystery. Sun, look out for yourself.
Embody your own adaptation.
You've got no corner on fire
& marauders upbraid those
vehicles invisible to them.
Nobody is a king of France, licked
all over like a stamp, my every garbage at
the actual border, 
making it, making it over, taking up the slack.
The bottle broke in your bag & you're 
getting flammable, very flammable. Luck
knows nothing, peels down
like a stocking & I 
thought, why wait any longer,
& found myself caught in
the breast of the beast
as it staggered to carry 
me up the stairs. His clothes are
dirty, but his hands are a sumptuous pyre.
What's so perfect about a stranger,
the greasy smoke of being
swallowed up or disappearing.
I can't carry the remainder.





proportions of a giant in monument valley
 

inside the bottle with the ship
were several Drowned sailors
elegy acts on inward skies
what you imagine about radio waves
these elegant machines bend sinister
sentience itself, disordering of the senses,
sentimental disgust, disuse, unease
by palliative measures supply
sufficient echoes to eliminate our organs
scattered bones prove the date of the body
they are rexed beyond the farthest shoal
consumed by a mosaic, a forest of saltshakers
an obstinate minor puzzle
at my bidding everything is procedural
a relative view is counterintuitive,
journalism is not written by journalists
the diaspora was juggled, then slain
intercept a preferred designator 
a kernal, a Trophy
low birth fashioned a hallmark swagger
to replace geometrical dreams with scant leviathans:
is this an improvement?
where is the life that later I led
how to account for the
strategems, in what I am weakest exemplify
I am departed, protean
twinned stick figures cut
up drawings with scissors, put
the pieces in their pockets,
confidence in shapes . . .

inner turmoil is as oblique as
how fair realism fares the objects

a primitive, endangered mahogany mask,
a convict's garb, soil cleared from weeds.
these teeth sown won't become full grown:
prey talks foreign; heads hang in the halls.
habit is only two dimensional, as with any tool
barbarous cattle, drudgery of ammunition,
improper use of artificial blue collars
I died of foliage; I died of typed patterns on carbon paper;
I died of a chief delight. fare thee well, crackpot.
I break a sweat, the dish is still cold
read my Palm, do what it says
it's time that we get up on all fours

Handwritten Preface to Reverse the Book
 

   1 Reverse the book in duration. What does that mean? I am writing to you. These notes now when it's too late.   2 If the cyborg you read about in bookstores is an immigrant from Mexico crossing into the U.S. beneath a floodlit court, then mine is a Punjabi-British hitchhiker on a JI visa. This is tunneling as seen from a satellite--sort of concave warp in the dirt of the line.   3 She lives in a house with others, including animals, creating individual spaces of companionship and ardor. What happens when this domestic life grows suspect? When the grass reverts in its granular drag to the subject of architecture: the failure of a house to believe in its occupants?   4 Mate with surfaces. Okay. Hitchhike. Okay. Make a cup of Darjeeling tea and start walking down a sidewalk in America. I saw this in a film starring George Clooney; no, Natalie Wood. The last scene is her, the gamine self, kicking off her shoes as the house explodes behind her. Perpetrating, she doesn't flinch. Sips tea. Keeps walking. I wanted to write that. Continuance. As it related to loss. The secret pleasure of refusing to live like a normal person in a dress/with a sex drive and fingers/dreamy yet stabilized in the caf of languages.   5 I want to have sex with what I want to become. This is a statement related to women arriving in a country it would be regressive to leave. Then, writing, I was filled with a longing for--for what? George-in-the-flesh? George Clooney in Idaho, pretending to pick up hitchhikers as research for his next movie in which he plays a mild-mannered serial killer? No. A different series of acts. Tricky. For example, I'm embarrassed by this book. It makes my blood roar to think of you reading it. So intimate. A text. Then it is a document related to shame flooding the body to make it red. Who doesn't want to heal a human body? Who doesn't want a perfect human body? The body of my hitchhiker is, thus, inevitably female or Punjabi, fused to the production of secrets. There are no e-mails home from the e-mail caf. Nothing. Phone calls, bullshitting. Sickening. I mean, what is this girl/my girl doing, there in a foreign heartland like a dog with a thumb? My Laloo, about to do it. Don't do it, little one. Red dress. Don't get into the car.    6 But then, lit up, a red wife, kind of, not really, she sets out to see things as they are. Describes a virtual countryside. Jumps a box car. Drinks domestic beer. Okay. She does it and I write it down: a damaged eye with votive filaments. (I am writing to you.) "No point in writing home. Then what?





Wish (2)
 

   1 But I was thinking today about our conversation earlier in the summer. Exhausted, you lay your head on the kitchen table and said: "But what's the difference between a monster and a cyborg? I need something to eat. Do you have any chocolate? Opening the fridge, I said quietly and perhaps too seriously, trying to impress you: "The monster is that being who refuses to adapt to her circumstances. Her fate. Her body. Great Britain. You said: "So, is Laloo English or British? I said: "She's from London. But the more I said London, the more it sounded like a joke. LondonLondonLondon.   2 I was thinking today about what happens when you keep going in a car. This is something you can only do here. Wish for something. Did you ever do it? Wish you weren't there? I want that go on, go even though it is unclear to me what happens when you get to the Panama Canal or Idaho. Hitchhiking in Idaho as a veritable child, I was taken in by a farming couple, Fatty and Daddy, a hundred miles or so outside of Boise. Fatty was rail thin, about seventy-five, and Daddy was a big man who had a reclining chair in each room and looked younger than his wife. They picked me up in their truck--I was sitting by the side of the road brushing the knots out of my hair with my fingers--and I stayed with them for five days. They said it was not the right thing for me to be in the open like that, and they took me to eat every day at a restaurant called Country Buffet. In my innocence, I had been walking on a road that led to the country compound of a KKK leader/operative, Charles Reynold. What is an operative? It is someone who is always planning a way in, like the hen-house fox with his beautifully red, bushy tail. Daddy, Fatty, and I hunkered down until Daddy's nephew, Robert, stopped by on his way through nowhere and gave me a ride to Boise proper, where there was a bus station. I waited until Robert had gone and then I walked out to the main drag to get a cup of coffee and interview murderers. "I can take you as far as the state line. "That would be lovely. Obsessed, far from home with its gooseberry patches and grim professions based upon openings at Heathrow Airport or Nestle, the main employers in the dingy part of northwest London that constituted my origins, I said yes. Soft yes to the color green, which is going.    3 That is a tree (going) but also an ocean: a way of being saturated with color that only happens here in your country for me; for you it might happen in another place. Mine. Like Laloo, I lived for many years on an island with congested traffic flows. Thus, a juniper tree flying by the window, intensely blue, or the Atlantic Ocean, to the left, if the car has a destination to the south, such as to The Keys, is magical to me. Improbable in light of my origins. Hers. The girl in the car. I don't know. I am writing to you, in your special writing dress made from scraps of lace as if it (the dress, the morning of writing ahead of you) is a caf; as if, writing, you are hypnotizing not only the biologies of strangers and friends but also yourself. For this reason, when I think of you reading, I think of you as writing blindly. You read but you are also writing. As if my own eyes were closed, I see your white books floating in the sky above my painting of the red girl. These books are separate from my own work, here in the salt-water notebook, but they communicate with it in a nonlocal sense. Like birds.    4 This is pre but the notebook is after. Soaked already at the edge and foamy. Past future. Writing on the warp when dry. Pages. Entries by hand. That is the morning I woke up and walked to the Pacific Ocean, after a night in a motel in Florence, Oregon, complete with a dodgy door and the reality of pillows. The woman at the front desk was wearing a very pretty apron with purple and yellow flowers on it. An expatriate, she said exaggeratedly, oblivious to our common origin: "About four miles. You're not going to walk, are you? Do you have an umbrella? You can't go out like that, ducky.   5 I walked towards the sound of something roaring in a day, the kind of day that is like darkness but lit up, on its forested, proximal verge by gorse, which is a bright yellow flower. Citron-yellow and a kind of tin or silver roofing with holes in it. The day. Like walking in a dreamed landscape drenched with the wrong rain. Monsoon. What kind of rain is this? I recognized the immensity but not the temperature. This was monstrous: the inability to assimilate, on the level of the senses, an ordinary experience of weather. Here is the tongue, for example, constantly darting out to feel the air: what is it? Is it summer? Is it a different season? It's a different day. That's okay. Damaged from her travels, in some sense unsettled, enormously anxious, a girl does it anway: gets up and goes. It's as if the day has a memory of her and not the other way around.





Text to Complete a Text
 

Sex is always monstrous. Blood appears in the air next to the body but nobody asks a question about the body. "Please touch me there. More. Oh god. For a hitchhiker, the problem of the boudoir is transferred to a makeshift, itchy, unsafe space on the verge of a New Mexico highway. It is often the sex of another era, in which the socks and dress shirt/blouse are not necessarily removed.I hitchhiked in the beginning because it seemed glamorous to me, ultra-American, like a Christian with an entrenched migraine who resorts to brand-name anti-inflammatories when prayer does not do the trick. At first, my encounters on the thoroughfares of your country were quotidian; after all, it is not really hitchhiking to buy a Greyhound ticket three weeks in advance then have a going-away party in a dorm with a banner and balloons. Again, this is an example of departure in another time. As a foreign student on scholarship, it was an ordinary matter to file for an extension for the completion of a thesis on Salman Rushdie's early works. Nevertheless: "How can we keep tabs on these JI visa holders, who come over here and . . . the university, as an institution, really needs to be more accountable. We need a database and we need a system of checks and balances to make sure any change of address is verified by at least two pieces of information. They need to do their course work and then they need to go home.I didn't want to go home. This is a boring sentence. Perhaps for you Oregon is a calming word, evoking images of blackberry pie, ocean vistas, and the capture of suspected felons. I had never heard the word Oregon before. Like the distance of Scotland from London, it seemed impossibly far. A beautiful hazard: to go and keep going. How can I put this? In England, nobody ever, ever, ever did this. I, who once drove straight to Glasgow with a thermos of instant coffee mixed with milk and sugar, in a dinged-up Datsun Cherry, was considered an anomaly. "Are you demented? Why do you want to drive in a car to bloody Scotland? It's seven hours on the M1, man! Though, outwardly, I was wan and somewhat reticent, I . . . no, I was. My sexual experience consisted of lying under an elm tree in Hyde Park at the age of seventeen and being told by an undergraduate student of the London School of Economics that my breasts in that position, from that angle, resembled two fried eggs. We were meeting in a park as per the era. I am sure contemporary Punjabi-British teenagers are fearless individuals, undaunted by the prospect of community censure. Back then we met by the iron-wrought gate on a park bench, on a path built for seventeenth-century promenades. It is always a century. In my century, sex was a field of restraint and intensity unsurpassed by anything except drinking coffee in a foreign country like Scotland or Wales and borrowing my father's car forever. "Are you out of your bleeding head? Your dad's going to skin you alive!In some sense, this (driving) is the opposite of hitchhiking, in which the interior of the car is always unfamiliar. The day was real in a different way back then, in the way that it sensitized me to risk, a kind of twin to permisson. Two black swans: that day and this one, history and fiction, what I went for and what I really wanted, which I didn't know until I got there by which time it was impossible to consider the long journey home as either practical or sensible, considering the trouble I was already in and the rain, which had started to come down in a series of reddish sheets; the streetlamps were pink.On Prince Street, in Glasgow, I saw the sign for American style pizza and went down the steps to the basement caf. The tables were coated with green plastic. There was hot tea, which the waitress slung down my gullet with a funnel as I focused my eye on a laminated print of a white, blocky rose with a pink dot at its center. "Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the waitress, pronouncing "osh so that it rhymed with horse. "Are you from India? "Would you like some jam with that scone? I bet they don't have scones in India, do they? "More tea? I heard you have a lot of tea, over there, isn't that right?Plan b: The extension of my throat. The euphoria of theft. Other countries with their sayings and beliefs. The original plan, formulated by my father during his morning communte across London: marrying a British-born Hindu Brahmin dentist with brown skin, but not too brown, and rosy cheeks. Note on the mantelpiece, tucked behind the marble figurine of Shiva: what is forthcoming under the original plan? Extraction? What kind of sex is possible on the dentist's chair late at night for that girl, your girl, who nervously asks for a blanket? She has her socks on. She's shivering. It is sometimes sex when you touch yourself beneath the proffered blanket clearly not washed between patients, but in this scene the limbs of the dentist's young Asian bride are rigid and smell faintly of wintergreen-scented nail polish or mouthwash. Dad, "please don't swallow. Rinse then spit. Spit then swallow.I could not go home and so, after a brief visit to the Hill House--Charles Rennie Mackintosh's art deco home on the Firth of Clyde, where he painted geometric rosebuds forever in a kind of frenzy, as it seemed from the dcor--I turned left and kept driving. I drove my car into the Atlantic and kept driving, my chest very tight beneath the surface. It was difficult to feel anything or really to see, and so I can only say that I went into a damaging ocean. This is going. Damaged, washed up on the mythical shores of New Jersey a few days later, my car failed to start. This is later, when the car stopped, and, looking up from my hands, white-knuckled on the steering wheel, I realized that I was okay.Now I am here, in the future of color. I'm sorry I do not have more to say about the period of submergence that preceded my arrival. I am not interested in it. I do not recall it. I . . . It was only when my car stopped that I realized what I had to do, on my own terms, with my own two legs: get going. Is that how you say it? Get up and go. The destiny of my body as separate from my childhood: I came here to hitchhike. I came here to complete a thing I began in another place. Removing wet pages from my rucksack, I lay them on the shore, securing them with beautiful shells and pebbles. When they dried, I folded them into squares and put them in my pocket, next to my body. Misshapen, exhilarated, I said get. I said go. Get up now and go. "Are you okay? "Do you need a ride somewhere? "Let me look in the trunk. I might have something in there. Here you go. You're shivering! Do you need to go to the hospital? At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.





To Future Eleanors
 

How will you
cut off from Zions,
              fall on your knees among the lions?
What if you 
cut off from hymns
              confound worksong with anthem

Cut off from Scripture
                    find sense suspect
                    and worship
                                     incoherence--
                                     distrust the laces
                                     and adore the tangled thread?

                                     What of you
                    without a holy thing,
                    but every sacrilege
                    of the sacrileged class?

Godsave your unsuspecting fists
grasping the fiery ladder bare,
your forehead
fighting a wordless solitaire.

Without some future language
how can I ask you?
If I could ask in Euphorese,
Moonskrit, in Ecolow....

                    What will you do with
                    Grandma's savings--
                    those relics atticked
                    in your head
                    of effort, vision?

On pain of death, scratch pictures
in the dust
                  as she did--
I fear my after-thirst.








Where Somebody Died
 

The self refuses to appear
          in this bare place.
 It fears that mute chair
          and the still window.
 The sunlight scares it.
 There might rise up a sound.
 The door doesn't like to move,
          and the crow out there
          hesitates; he knows
          a hole flown into by mistake
          would make a bite of him.
 What was sits standstill in the chair,
          hangs, stunned, against the dry-eyed light.
 Nobody in sight.
 Inanimate things, still lifeless.
 This room's so empty
          I doubt I'm standing here;
          there can't be room for me
          and total emptiness.
 Only some far-off sounds persist.
 The brute truck
          over the interstate.
 The flames in the incinerator
          chewing his old vests.





Kitchen Fable
 

The fork lived with the knife
      and found it hard--for years
 took nicks and scratches,
      not to mention cuts.
  
 She who took tedium by the ears:
      nonforthcoming pickles,
 defiant stretched-out lettuce,
      sauce-gooed particles.
  
 He who came down whack.
 His conversation, even, edged.
  
 Lying beside him in the drawer
      she formed a crazy patina.
 The seasons stacked--
      melons, succeeded by cured pork.
  
 He dulled; he was a dull knife,
 while she was, after all, a fork.





Pain in the House
 

Feeling her head pick up her body,
          question mark,
          blurred misstamped question mark
          snakes out of bed,
          trying to jiggle unhappiness
          as little as possible,
          not to wake pain,
          not to raise a shade,
          if raising a shade in the dark wakes pain.
 Under the shade the stars are awake, smiling--
          ready to frown on unhappiness.
 And the happiness of the unconscious
          is scurrying already
          from the knife-edge of light,
          pain's night-light,
          waiting under the door across the hall.
 Dread's square hair stiffens,
          her feet have corners,
          trying to trick the stairs out of their creaking,
          and the house out of groaning before coffee,
          before resurrection.
 Death before resurrection is hard;
          breakfast and the stars belong first;
          plenty of time to die all day
          when everything does groan, and unhappiness
          shakes itself out like a musty old mare
          all over the house.
 Dread says to herself: Serves me right
          for leaving home, for learning to read;
          serves me right for children and menopause
          and cosmetic surgery, and elation in gin.
                                       I must travel back
          through the shade and the black holes and the frowns,
          through drink and tampon and alphabet
          to the kitchen and mother and dad and
          the morning of the resurrection was the first day.





Limits
 

Only he
Remembered the day we met
And only I 
The day we said goodbye:
"Last day of June, our first blackberry pie,
He always said.
A wood fire in the summer kitchen,
The hottest day.... A squall in the bedroom.
        I can't remember.

Nor he,
The December cube of clay,
The storm the day before,
How the bare trees
Played Giant Step in the dawn wind,
Or how
On the other bed, rhythmically
Touching her knuckles to the wall,
My mother slipped forever into fantasy.

Only he
Remembered the spoken hate
(Its change too sheepish to impart)
Saw daggers still growing
In bristling clump out of my heart.

I beg you, kids--no memorials, please.
Don't write poems to me. Don't bother.
What we said we said. What's unsaid lacks ears.
In this I'm like my father. 







Against the Kitchen Wall
 

A mothball May.
         I lean against the kitchen wall.
         The sacred pear tree on the hill.
         The skyline, small green wheat
         waverunning with the wind.
  
 From west to east the green's
         spanned out by men
         on horseback and on foot,
         men with long staffs
         slow-motion, searching.
  
 The saddles glint.
         What are they sweeping for?
         Why coming this direction?
         Are those staffs guns?
  
 If they are after quail, or hares,
         why is their fanning law-enforcement grim,
         as for a felon, a missing person, or
         one too imbecile to find her way?
  
 One who laid waste
         the safe place by the kitchen wall,
         bankrupted her May day,
         malpracticed pear and gifted wheat?
  
 I'm waiting, men.

A Memorable Fancy
 

At the toll booth she stopped to ask who was in charge of the expressway, or future, the words slipping back and forth in front of her. A large-headed woman, her hair roped and lashed about her head, looked up and held out her hand: George Washington. Seven times.I have no money, she said, suddenly aware that this was indeed a fact, as was the yoke around the woman's upright neck. Her nostrils flared, her body strained against it, Al Green in the background. Are you a poet? she asked, meaning do you feel that tug? The roar of tires is the rhythm of my day, the woman said, every fourteen cars a sonnet. Behind her the city slickened: vehicles everywhere, idling, honking, revving, stiffening themselves against her. The braided woman did not flinch. George Washington, seven times.I am lost, she said. Can you tell me where to start?The braided woman's thumbs smoothed the air. You can try Port Authority. But I wouldn't hold my breath.In response to the woman's kindness, she shared her latest vision: Louis XVI is alive and living in Washington, a staggeringly blind man filling his frame with BBQ ribs and glazed ham. Under his bed he keeps a rifle, thinking a cattle rustler might show up in the night. Deeply suspicious of his dreams he hires a young woman to stand in the corner and lash herself all night as he sleeps.It doesn't matter if I see her, he said, it's knowing she is somewhere lashing herself.





Endless Inter-States
 

1

They go down to the expressways, baskets
In hand, they go down with rakes, shovels
And watering cans, they go down to pick

Beans and trim tomato plants, they go down
In wide-brimmed hats and boots, passing
By the glass-pickers, the Geiger counters, those

Guarding the toxic wastes. They go down
Remembering the glide of automobiles, the
Swelter of children in back seats, pinching, twitching,

Sand in their bathing suits, two-fours of Molson's
In the trunk of the car. They go down, past
The sifters, the tunnellers, those who transport

Soil from deep in the earth, and are content
To have the day before them, are content to imagine
Futures they will inhabit, beautiful futures

Filled with unimagined species, new varieties of
Plant life, sustainable abundance,
An idea of sufficient that is global. Or,

Because cars now move on rails underground,
The elevated roads are covered in earth,
Vines drape around belts of green, snake

Through cities, overgrown and teeming
With grackles and rats' nests, a wall
Of our own devising, and the night

Watchmen with their machine guns
Keeping humans, the intoxicated,
Out. I am sorry for this version, offer

You coffee, hot while there is still
Coffee this far north, while there is still news
To wake up to, and seasons

Vaguely reminiscent of seasons.

Web-toed she walks into the land, fins
Carving out river bottoms, each hesitation
A lakebed, each mid-afternoon nap, a plateau,

Quaint, at least that is my dream of her,
Big shouldered, out there daydreaming
The world into existence, pleasuring herself

With lines and pauses. How else? What is a lake
But a pause? People circling it with structures, dipping
In their poles? Once she thought she could pass by

Harmless. Scraping wet shale, her knees down in it, she
Tries to remember earth, that ground cover. She tries
To reattach things, but why? What if the world

Is all action? What if thought isn't glue, but tearing?
She sits at the lake edge where the water never meets
Earth, never touches, not really, is always pulling

Itself on to the next.


3

Now she sits by her memory of meadow, forlorn, shoeless.
She could scoop PCBs from the Hudson, she is
Always picking up after someone. But what? What

Is the primary trope of this romp? Where her uterus
Was the smell of buckshot and tar, an old man chasing
Her with a shotgun across his range. Cow pies and

Hornets' nests, gangly boys shooting cats with BB guns,
Boys summering from Calgary, trees hollowed out,
Hiding all manner of contraband goods. When she peers

In the knotted oak, classic movies run on
The hour, Scout on the dark bark, Mildred
Pierce with a squirrel tale wrap. Nature is over,

She concludes. Nature is what is caught, cellular,
Celluloid. She sticks a thumb in another tree, a
Brownstone, a small girl--her heart a thing locked.

It's been so long since she felt hopeful. (Perhaps nature
Is childhood.) The morning after Chernobyl
Out there with tiny umbrellas. All those internal

Combustions. This is a country that has accepted death
As an industry, it is not news. She has been warned.
Her ratings sag. She scans her least apocalyptic

Self and sees mariners floating, Ben
Franklin penning daily axioms, glasses lifting
From the river bank, planked skirts on Front,

China-like through the industrious, thinking, traffic
Clogged city, its brick heavy with desire for good.
Memory of meadow, Dickinson an ice pick scratching

Wings in her brain: if you see her standing, if you move
Too quickly, if you locate the centre, if you have other
Opportunities, by all means if you have other opportunities.

Abondoned mine shafts on either side, those
Tight curves between Kaslo and New Denver,
Hairpin at glacial creek, splash of red

Bellies muscling, streaming up, we see them
From the open window. Or once did. Even here?
Salmon stocks diminish, mammals dying off.

No, he said, not in your lifetime. Vertical;
Traces where the charge went off,
Ruggedness is your only defence, he

Said, be difficult to cultivate, navigate. Offer
No hint of paradise, no whiff of
Golf course. Uninhabitability your only

Recourse. Lashed, that moment, prolonged
Leaving, her father on the roadside
Dreaming his world fitting in some place,

Without being reigned in, her father's fathers
Throwing rocks down on Hannibal,
Straddling the last large elm in the valley,

Knowing where and how to lay the charge, or
Sucking shrapnel from an open wound,
The lambs all around, bleating.

Which liftetime? Beyond what brawn? Who
Knew where the road would take us?
Neat, neat, the rows of apple trees

There in the valley, red summers, the heat
Of Quebecois pickers, VWs in a circle,
Firepit and strum. Men from Thetford

Mines dreaming peaches, dreaming
Clean soil. Hour upon hour the self
Becomes less aware of the self.

Beautiful, beautiful, the centre line, the road,
This power station and control tower, these
Weigh scales, these curves, that mountain

Goat, those cut lines, these rail lines, that
Canyon, the Fraser, the Thompson,
The old highways hyphenating

Sagebrush, dead-ending on chain
Link, old cars collecting like bugs
On the roadside, overturned, curled, astute,

Memory of the Overlanders,
Optimism, headlong into
Hell's Gate. Churn of now,

The sound barriers, the steering
Wheel, the gas pedal, the gearshift,
The dice dangling, fuzzy,

Teal, dual ashtrays, AM radio
Tuned to CBC, no draft, six cylinders,
The gas tank, the gearshift, easing

Into the sweet spot behind
The semi, flying through Roger's
Pass; the snowplow, the Park

Pass, sun on mud flap, the rest stop
Rock slides, glint of snow, the runaway
Lanes, the grades steep as skyscrapers,

The road cutting through cities,
Slicing towns, dividing parks,
The road over lakes, under rivers,

The road right through a redwood,
Driving on top of cities, all eyes
On the DVD screen,

All minds on the cellphone,
The safari not around, but inside
Us: that which fuels.

No matter, the slither of pavement is endless,
Today the rain, a gold standard, all the
Earmarks of, never mind, all is well, all

Is well, and who doesn't want to hear that?
She gets on her scooter and roars, she gets
On her skateboard and feels the air under

Foot, she shakes out her hair, thinking of California,
Thinking of allergies, thinking of the wreck
Of place: who ever promised more? The iris

With its feigned restraint, the daring tuba,
The horn of shoe, utilitarian, delicate. Such
Useful domesticity, such hopeful electronics.

Once she disappeared by turning sideways.
Now she finds it difficult to reappear. She lifts 
The sediment of time to her palm, feels it sift

Between her fingers: bone, bits of event. Aren't
We all a bit fluish this century? Nothing bearing any
Mark of otherwise. No prescript, nothing a bit of hope

Won't cure. Such a churn of optimism:
That which consecrates will not kill. Maybe New York?
She fits herself on an easterly course: been done,

Been done, but what better than the well-trodden
Path? Beautiful, beautiful, the seams
Of the rich, their folded linens,

Their soft bags of money. If it ain't broke
Don't fix, if it ain't resistant, don't
Wince, if it fits like a boot, then boot it.

And so she does.

The Grey Hills of Oxford
 

Thirty-six-inch with several contusions, thirty-six-
Inch bald, slight wear on the right, thirty-six-inch
With a six-inch tear, thirty-six and evenly worded,
Thirty-six on its side, thirty-one with evenly spaced
Bald patches, larger with fist-sized threads, upright
With fist-sized treads, half-bured with the right side
Flattened, one rim with only a ripple of tread, two
Melded together, one mag wheel with a sliver
Of dark centre, three like links in a chain,
Three like leaking clay, one like a grey whale's
Snout, two flattened whitewalls on top of three
Barely discernable tube-like shapes, several earth
Tones near a white crumb of tire, seven stacked
Like folded commas, two very grey, burned tire
Corpses, something like a tractor tire, bigger
Than the others and basking in the sun, upper-
Most on the tire pile, near the canyon walls.

Four tires like forgotten bobsleds at the bottom,
Several tires jutting out from the earth,
Several at the top disentangled, but not free,
Sitting on the earth, half immersed.

At a distance, tires lose their particularity,
Tires become brushstrokes, hills
Fading into sky.





Topsy-Turvy World
 

 
IF the butterfly courted the bee,    
  And the owl the porcupine;    
If churches were built in the sea,    
  And three times one was nine;    
If the pony rode his master,           
  If the buttercups ate the cows,    
If the cats had the dire disaster    
  To be worried, sir, by the mouse;    
If mamma, sir, sold the baby    
  To a gypsy for half a crown;          
If a gentleman, sir, was a lady,--    
  The world would be Upside-down!    
If any or all of these wonders    
  Should ever come about,    
I should not consider them blunders,           
  For I should be Inside-out!    
 

            Chorus

Ba-ba, black wool,    
  Have you any sheep?    
Yes, sir, a packfull,    
  Creep, mouse, creep!          
Four-and-twenty little maids    
  Hanging out the pie,    
Out jump'd the honey-pot,    
  Guy Fawkes, Guy!    
Cross latch, cross latch,       
  Sit and spin the fire;    
When the pie was open'd,    
  The bird was on the brier!





"Crying, my little one, footsore and weary
 

Crying, my little one, footsore and weary?
  Fall asleep, pretty one, warm on my shoulder:
I must tramp on through the winter night dreary,
  While the snow falls on me colder and colder.

You are my one, and I have not another;
  Sleep soft, my darling, my trouble and treasure;
Sleep warm and soft in the arms of your mother,
  Dreaming of pretty things, dreaming of pleasure.





"If no one ever marries me
 

If no one ever marries me,-- 
And I don't see why they should, 
For nurse says I'm not pretty, 
And I'm seldom very good--

If no one ever marries me 
I shan't mind very much; 
I shall buy a squirrel in a cage, 
And a little rabbit-hutch:

I shall have a cottage near a wood, 
And a pony all my own, 
And a little lamb quite clean and tame, 
That I can take to town:

And when I'm getting really old,-- 
At twenty-eight or nine-- 
I shall buy a little orphan-girl 
And bring her up as mine.





Vain and Careless
 

Lady, lovely lady,
    Careless and gay!
 Once when a beggar called
    She gave her child away.
  
 The beggar took the baby,
    Wrapped it in a shawl,
 "Bring her back, the lady said,
    "Next time you call.
  
 Hard by lived a vain man,
    So vain and so proud,
 He walked on stilts
    To be seen by the crowd.
  
 Up above the chimney pots,
    Tall as a mast,
 And all the people ran about
    Shouting till he passed.
  
 "A splendid match surely,
    Neighbours saw it plain,
 "Although she is so careless,
    Although he is so vain.
  
 But the lady played bobcherry,
    Did not see or care,
 As the vain man went by her
    Aloft in the air.
  
 This gentle-born couple
    Lived and died apart.
 Water will not mix with oil,
    Nor vain with careless heart.





Walter B. Needs Some Time
 

          
          When Walter B., one evening, explained to Beatrice that he "needed time, Beatrice pulled the last bite of fish from Walter B.'s mouth and shook it at him. She wished he had said instead that he needed a timbrel, and off they would have gone together to the spectacle where the timbrelist often played. But Walter B. did not need a timbrel. Walter B. "needed time. So Beatrice wrapped what was left of the fish in a red wool cloth and set out to find him some. It was cold outside. If I was time, wondered Beatrice, where would I be? She watched the humans in the distance breathe into the grass. If I was time, wondered Beatrice, how would I remind myself of where I was? She held the last bite of fish up to her mouth for warmth. It began to feel heavy in her hands. She wished he had said instead that he needed a timbrel. She wished she was for Walter B. the time he needed. But she was not. She unwrapped the last bite of fish and studied it. It reminded her of a world inside of which Walter B. was mostly gone. She rubbed her arms with it. She buried her face in it. It began to grow around her like a soft, white house. It grew, and it grew, until at last Beatrice was inside. She slowly walked through its rooms. In the first room, a pile of shovels. In the second, a pitcher of milk. When she stepped inside the third, Walter B. and the timbrelist were helping each other on with their coats. "If you were time, called out Walter B., "where would you be? Before Beatrice could answer, Walter B. saluted her, took the timbrelist by the hand, and left her alone in the soft, white house. Beatrice sat on the floor. Much later she would drink from the pitcher of milk. She would lean against the pile of shovels. But for now all Beatrice could do was sit on the floor. She would sit on the floor of the soft, white house until she grew hungry again for Walter B.'s last bite of fish.
        




The Traitor
 

          
          A few days before the first snow the soldiers dressed like children began to appear. "Come quick, said Beatrice, fetching Walter B. away from his scripture, "and bring candy! Walter B. pulled on his robe and joined Beatrice on the balcony. "Oh look, said Beatrice, "you can see their small, sweet eyes peeking through the bramble. Walter B. threw a handful of red gumdrops into the air and watched the soldiers dressed like children scatter, and raise their arms in glee. "Feels sinful, doesn't it? purred Beatrice. They watched them stand in the field and chew. "Which one, asked Walter B., "do you think is the hero? "That one, said Beatrice. "Definitely that one. The one with the mittens. "Yes, agreed Walter B., "the others seem less... festooned. "And which one do you think, asked Walter B., "is the traitor? Beatrice bit her lip and looked around. "Maybe that one, she said. "The one with the orange flower in the pocket of his vest. Walter B. agreed, but to be certain he thought that he should ask. "Little traitor, called out Walter B. The traitor looked up. "I knew it! said Beatrice, clapping her hands. The traitor came closer. The wind shook the oragne flower loose from his pocket, but he did not run after it. He missed his mother. The traitor came closer, but then he stopped. He curled into his flowerless vest and fell asleep. Walter B. and Beatrice yawned. The soldiers dressed like children opened their mouths as wide as they could, but there was no more candy. There would never again be more candy. And so they sailed away to another land.
        




All Is Fair in Love and War
 

          
          "Who is Beatrice, wondered Walter B., "to give Beatrice up her hope? Beatrice sulked under her cauliflower-colored hat. "It is like, said Beatrice, "I can barely crack another joke. "This is correct, said Walter B. "It is most certainly like that. Nevertheless, whoever you are it is not up to you to give up your hope. And additionally you are spoiling the day. "What is giving up your hope'? asked Beatrice. "It is when, explained Walter B., "you have to ask.*It all began with the appearance of The Unlikelies. It was difficutl to anticipate in these small men sitting cross-legged on the living room floor the havoc they would bring. They held hands. They sang a song about trees, and as they sang their tree-shaped ears swelled with what Beatrice would later describe as pride. They asked for gently steamed vegetables. They seemed genuinely concerned. "Pick a heart, they cheered, "any heart. Beatrice picked one. "Expect for that one. Beatrice picked another. "And that one, too. "That was less joyous, said Beatrice, "than I'd expected. "The hearts you picked, explained The Unlikelies, "had been picked yesterday. "It is unlikely, said The Unlikelies, "that will happen again. Walter B. hid in the kitchen. Whose side The Unlikelies were on, Beatrice began to wonder. "Pick a heart, they urged. Beatrice picked another. "Except for that one. Beatrice picked another. "And that one, too. With each heart Beatrice picked The Unlikelies grew larger. They seemed genuinely concerned. "All is dare, they reminded Beatrice with their mouths full of broccoli, and carrots, and peas, "in blur and core. By dawn, Walter B. could still hear Beatrice picking hearts. Their empty husks filled the floor. The Unlikelies huddled closer together. "Except for that one, they mumbled sleepily, moving closer to the door. The Unlikelies were, by now, as big as the furniture. "And that one, too. Walter B. hid in the kitchen. He imagined he would make out of all the husks a hearty soup. He rummaged for a pot. He would feed Beatrice the soup, drop by drop, until she forgot this highly unlikely event impossible to forsee by any hopeful thing. "All is spare in buds and more, promised The Unlikelies, as they squeezed their enormous bodies out the door.*Days later, when Beatrice asked Walter B. if The Unlikelies were still standing outside in the sunlight, congratulating each other, Walter B. said "no. But Beatrice knew they were there. And she knew they would return for her. They seemed genuinely concerned.





The Babies
 

          
          Some thought it was because of all the babies I suddenly seemed to be having. Others, that I should pay for the damages. Fact is, I wasn't getting any older, so I bought a small aquarium, and skipped town. Took up with a toy store owner until he left me for a more beautiful robot. Took up with a reader of instructional booklets. Never mind. I was lost. By the time I arrived at Mrs. Greenaway's, it was clear I was nowhere at all. In exchange for room and board, I'd rearrange her furniture, her birthmarks, her quiet animals, until they took on more satisfying shapes. Sometimes the shapes were simple, like a mustache or a pipe. Sometimes they were more complicated arrangements, like the one of dead Mr. Greenaway's closed barbershop. Over the years, as Mrs. Greenaway and I became more and more vague, the shapes did too. For identification purposes, we'd give them names like She Wasn't Fooling Anyone, She Was Hurt and She Was Hurt Bad or The Insides of Doctors. One night when I was working on a piece I thought I'd call Symphony, Symphony, the shapes began to slip out of my hands. At first, as Mrs. Greenaway remembers, the sound of broken glass. Then the trumpets. Then the terrible music of all those babies I once seemed to be suddenly having, marching, like soldiers, in rows. Then their round wet bellies coming towards me. Mrs. Greenaway still talks about how expertly they gathered me into their tiny arms. And how they took me away not like a prisoner. But like a mother. Into a past I still swear I never had.
        




The Mustache
 

          
          Everything about the young foreign taxidermist was overdone. Did he absolutely have to wear the apron with the tiny red castles in the shop? Or weave, at night, in and out of the trees? I don't think so. I would bring him buckets of ice water day after day hoping he would just cool off a bit. Fact is, he never did. But to be fair, he really was practicing what the papers called, "heroic medicine. It was love. I admit it. It was fancy love. I was the envy of the world, being hitched up with such a genius, and that felt good. Of course, these days, I can't touch rope or a small child without thinking of him. Without expecting his large hands to come out of nowhere. We were, as mother said, both "slowly losing our minds. He'd talk for hours about hygiene, the Water Cure for example, and wrote an award-winning essay on the Electric Bath as a way to treat hysteria in the female fox. "Too many foxes, he would say, shaking his fist, "too many foxes running around like chickens with their heads cut off. In the winter months we would ride our bicycles down to the scrap-metal yard where he would make love to me in devout silence. The delight in his eyes when he found that small cage! He was both tender and rough, and I had never, and will never again, be as touched by another man. I didn't notice the black mustache growing slowly but unmercifully on his left shoulder until two or three years into the affair. At first it seemed harmless. A small patch of dead grass. But eventually I couldn't help but only see the large dark field. Its silent twitching. By then it was already early fall, and the fact is, it tore us apart.





Eidolon
 

Down in fame's flood, down an alley, down
wind of now, elegant in self-denial,
an Iron Range wraith junking cue cards, an ideal,
an idol before which the Zeitgeist kneeled. 

Dylan, named for a poet named from an old
tale of the child who crawled to the sea, this land
is yours: the black plain the needle
ploughs from lip to label; be all, end all.






The Shuffle
 

Skipping out from the major international cocktail party
with my becleavaged blight, a jeroboam in her tight fist,
I broke open my copy of Sarcasm for Beginners, i.e., men.

Never had I seen so many pairs of to-the-elbow gloves.
Never did I see a puttoed ceiling groan so with thin talk
as the great, the grim and the gone pressed terrible flesh,

so many penguins offering tastesome wisps and skimps
from doilied salvers: cherry-shaded caviar, cheese puffs,
dark sugared berries, dainty octopods, gently vinegared,

with not enough tentacles to count the capes and stoles,
fine bespoke pashminas, silk snoods, at least one vicua
suit, tainted with gold thread. I'd seen down a Blenheim,

two Lime Rickeys and was eyeing a gamine mixologist
who was straining out Savoy Royales when my raddled
nemesis limped over to announce she had encountered

my latest screed, all four foot eleven of her tortoiseishly
quivering, a nubbin of cream cheese on her whiskery lip
and her good eye withering my borrowed companionette

as she leaned on air. I am not a man who has not known
the turmoil women offer, the gift you accept of their wit,
the way you'd slip a hand into a gloveful of cockroaches,

comply with a last-minute call to join a seal cull. Tanya,
I pouted, I am awed and honored you opened a window
in your schedule even to glance at my inconsequential

outpourings. At which point she clattered out a scoffing
gibe so sour you couldn't blend it with a chemistry set
from Hamley's and, seizing my escort by her neat wrist,

we tore out onto Jermyn Street, along which I performed
a sort of shuffle, one eye on the book and one on m'lady's
competition-standard backside as she led us to the Ritz.





Spiral
 

These years lift over coldly now: Aprils
and Augusts are gifted to ice, or sprawl
into mid-summers or year ends--pillars
of lesser standing. Still come no replies

to boyish queries, how the belly sleeper
buoys, begins again, becomes poor soul
or bull of appetite; why when the pearls
drop, no spool dares connect the ripples.





Hazy Alley Incident
 

Eugene, OR
Girl shouting Oliver! at the top of the cut-through
by Jacob's Gallery, you have now entered
the slenderest of histories, the skin-bound book
I store between my temples; in that mean
and moonless city, you must hang fraught
in your too-long coat, not a winner, but placed,
and in this cutty version of forever, forever
calling on your unseen beau, one flake in
a limbic blizzard, one spark in the synaptic blaze.
And now the rain turns, light but going steady
on the Willamette. Along the bank, I lift my pace
from devil-may-have-me to heading-somewhere 
and still your mouth in the haze calling is
a ruby carbuncle woken by a miner's head-beam,
the reddest berry in the hedgerow, which all
but the bird in the fable know not to pluck.





Thetis Heel
 

Even gods, though they were born 
in our own heads, died out to myth.

Just as no one can point to the source 
of the spring or later at sea can say: this

is the water from deep in the earth, that
flowed from the mountaintops, so

is the stream of mortals and gods.

About my origins I know 
nothing. I married the earth, a child

grew in me, fell
out of me at last, and I

babbled: little mutt of mine, I'll
name you, dunk you in invulnerability.

He smiled at me, held me tightly
by the heel and said mama.





The Archaeologist
 

In one who doesn't speak the story petrifies,
gets stumbled over, causes hurt. Then,

says the man who should know about the past, then 
is a word you need to learn now. Then 

lived lives had has
a name a body, sacrificial hands 

so god might help us. Feel with your hands and feet 
back along these countless steps and hear

the incessant bloodrush, its dark red

presence. That was what the man insisted, 
in so many words, pointing to the ornate

temple corridor, an altar 
conjured at its vanishing point.





Hungerpots
 

Did an argument break out in the kitchen that morning?
Was there smashing of pots and pans: you
want to eat somewhere else? Go on,

get out! Or were they set outside, shrewd, 
meant to feed on dust and hunger or to tempt the doves 
of peace? Nothing wrong with that as long as
the cook stays put by another fire. Hollow

vessels on grass socks, what do they want from this
puzzle of trees and clouds? Even the wind
seems to have forgotten how to whistle and wherever
you look, those who are gone cannot be seen.

They're steeped to their lips in bronzed silence. O
let their bellies chime like clocks, whack 
with ladles and sticks, drive devilish 
death out of those pots!





Search
 

Wandered tonight through a city
as ruined as a body with broken
ribs and a bared heart. Looked for you 

there with cookies in my pocket, searched 
for a sigh, for movement in demolished 
streets and alleys. Tonight

since I'd forgotten for a moment where you are,
I searched for you with hope in my bones.
But no matter how I lured you with my voice
and my eyes, walls of debris 

grew up steadily around you, cellars seemed
to creep around you. I remained alone
with those cookies in my pocket
and kept calling and walking.





Glasswork
 

my love who shelters in his words
sometimes falls silent for a sudden eternity
breathes that silence into a bell of glass
in which he calms storms

he draws lee lines in what was
it's more like a firefirm crackling
when he takes up words with ease
in a single glance, caressing my body

I read him day and night. What will it be like
when he withdraws into the word old,
arranges a last room, silver-white,
pushes the furniture a bit closer together

and crams still more fragile glass inside--
what will it be like when he grows transparent and breaks





Light-years
 

It's a beautiful world, you said,
with these trees, marshes, deserts,
grasses, rivers and seas

and so on. And the moon is really something
in its circuits 
of relative radiance. Include

the wingd M, voluptuous 
Venus, hotheaded Mars, that lucky devil
J and cranky Saturn, of course, plus

U and N and the wanderer P, in short 
the whole solar family, complete with its 
Milky Way, and count up all the other

systems with dots and spots and in
that endless emptiness what you've got 
is a commotion of you-know-what. It's a beautiful

universe, you said, just take a good look
through the desert's dark glasses 
for instance or on your back

in seas of grass, take a good look
at the deluge of that Rorschach--we're standing out there
somewhere, together.

honey gushes out, and

He plans to quarter it and quarter the quarters.
The knife first rehearses 
a meridian, then the equator,

then mid-cut tilts
and leaves a tatter on one half's rim.
You can tell he thinks about

what thought is bad at. You can see
that by comparison a chimp would appear,
within its limitations, deft, while the man

with no limitations with respect to principles of melon-slicing
does not. You can tell
he withholds himself from cantaloupe,

as if frightened they will go extinct and take
costs sunk in the skill of slicing them, and further tell
it will be the same next time, him approaching

the fruit as though newly, wondering if it had
a stone in it, or pith and segments,
or required coring, or stank when punctured,

or would show pleasing shapes in section.
He switches grip,
placing his palm over the fat edge of the blade

because a sock puppet has squeaked, 
Safety first.
The rinds parted from the sixteenths

are more or less a waste of flesh, according as thrift
argued with intemperance. You can tell
the impending chunks will be publicly homely, not those

of the cruise ship buffet where the night-shift Neopolitan
surpasses himself with flutes and scallops.
You can tell right off a mind unquiet

and at once absent, now remembering
J. at seventeen,
something out of a Kenyan Vermeer,

smiling elfinly as she sliced the cantaloupe.
You could tell by the way she sliced the cantaloupe

the way one slices a cantaloupe would tell a lot.
He draws the knife
along each inside edge to shave the pulp and seedmatter,

varying pressure, speed, and angle of attack
like a deaf man bowing a cello.
Stutters mark the inner faces. He slices

the slices radially into chunks, and varies
the spacing between the cuts from equal angles,
which makes the pieces too big at the center,

to equal volumes, which makes them too long at the poles.
You can tell, as he squeezes a lime-half over the pile
and steps back to admire his freehanded

benighted by-committee cantaloupe-justice,
he cannot be the children's hockey coach
or run for office, the erratic hexes him, he

circulates sometimes fogged and twitching in his house,
not wishing you could not tell, 
exactly, but wanting out.






Guess the Races of Three Boys from Champaign
 

                                  1

The nineish summer-skinny imp-boy veers
the bicycle he has no notion yet of trusting
off the sidewalk, where the squashed mulberries
form many contusions. Riding as though and as though
on an animal (maybe his bike
should have gazelle eyes) he is hatching plans
somehow angelically pristine of doubt
between them and fruition. He dumps
the bike on this side of the jungle gyms,
while cottonwood foam blows up from the branch,
and wind imparts the grass two sibling greens,
and parents show their callow half-formed centers
cajoling children. He is alone, and sets
himself to picking clover; whole minutes pass
when all he does is increase one bouquet
of grass-high nondescript white clover blossoms.
There must be a million in the field
not in his hand. He lays the fistful down
and takes a roofing nail out of his pocket,
and with it and his eldritch patience awls
through-holes in his foam-grips. He twists the stems
into a stalk he tapers, pinches off,
and jams into the handlebars, only
to watch the blossoms fall apart and over.

He tries and fails again, incredulous
now the ornament he planned as though
designing a contraption, some trebuchet
or hovercraft half-specified and magic,
will not work on mere enthusiasm.
His tantrum comes on suddenly, a spastic
little stomping dance across the grass,
and ends without his having made a sound.
He is off the way he came. They are
not brutal, the feebly dreamt surrounding houses,
crops striving in the dirt, child-rearing habits
lapsed and current, like childhood diseases.
The bric-a-brac on his bedroom floor that damns
him to time. But neither are they tender
of that thing his paltry ruined posy,
the fanning homely crumbs of perfect whim,
is evidence of.

                                  2

The hangdog rookie lifeguard shuffles in
already delegated an action item
involving a stepladder, a spray bottle,
and a biohazard bag. The dim
guttering aura of his authority
tries to fill the locker room, as does
the smell of sock, and calms imperfectly
the preteens disobeying rule eleven
regarding horseplay. The kid attains the utmost,
handicapable shower stall, yanks
the curtain and deploys his ladder, ascending
three rungs of his portable Golgotha
and staring as though straining to make out
St. Paycheck in a stained glass window. The bottle
and empty plastic sack slump at his sides,
props whose ritual has slipped his mind,
or tools of tradesman or physician agape
at a humdinger, for damned if not nine feet
up the cinder blocks, improbably
massive, glistening, and cantilevered,
there does not jut a load of crap. He says,
almost quietly, already showing
awareness of those situations where
resort to melodrama will not help,
but still somehow reluctant to let go
of being someone singled out by fate,

"You have got to be motherfucking kidding me.
No poo-flinger or projectile buttor
titters from the bench. The sun, supremely
supercilious in the skylights, mums;
the ceiling fans the shit perhaps was aimed at
spin an rpm too fast for one to follow.
The dented cubby rows and columns retain
the continence of safe-deposit boxes.
If he does not punch out and not come back,
the lifeguard shall be our savior in ways
we scarcely dreamt or paid him for, thinking
all he had to do was watch our children.
As for the mystery of whether one
is being kidded, it is his to bear.
No ceo of pooldom makes that much.

                                  3

The corner drugstore lends the cause a spigot;
the cause runs hoses to the parking lot,
and proto-nubile junior-high girls lure
out of the intersection, by sign and banner,
ten perverts an hour. Shucked garden-snail 
of an errand-runner, five dollars gets you
a sort of car wash, and gets the wrestling team
closer to their travel fund objective.
Small talk with the game and patient coach
will pleasantly derail you, as the squad
swarms with half-grasped purpose in your service.
One is dutiful and has a bucket.
One is cheery with a rag. The rowdy
buck for the nozzle, the second-rowdiest
fleeing when one prevails: rinser-off
of quarter panels and future quarterbacks,
broad-shouldered as though tapped for it, as though
for violin or chess. Can he see,
from where he is, the rainbow that he issues,

the laughter-stippled day convened for him
and his? Days to come he is hawking
two-dollar Jujubes out of a knapsack
in the alley by the multiplex;
there fall to him the odd, ambivalent
vagina-samplings behind the Sonic Burger,
and on his cast the day he tries to ollie
the planters at the bank, a turquoise heart
to dot the i in Brandi. We are going
to be all right; good supervisors abound;
our grab-ass shall be moderated, and those
who tsk are bound to say I knew you when.
We need be lots of things, but never lonely.





The Funeral Sermon
 

Almost droll
in its assault on magisterial,
my father's funeral
sermon made me prowl,
--agitated--from bean casserole
to escarole
salad, then taco casserole,
and back all afternoon, in thrall
to Dad's every growl,
cramped certitude, and corporal
wavering lost to shrill
sacral
cant: The pastoral
story was Dad's own, though, frail
as it is: faith and God steamroll
death. His wife's and daughter's role
was to die--a trial
of faith, not cruel
so much as natural,
when the supernatural
is, as it was for him, literal.
His cloistral
withdrawal, according to the minister's drawl,
was grace, and his temporal
forfeitures fat collateral
on eternity. It felt surreal
(can there be a funeral
without, now, the word surreal?)
to hear Dad's stoic control
and loneliness spiral
heavenward on genial praise, real
enough for the general,
one supposes. An orchestral
hymn flared through the stereo's cloth grill.
Cold waves over the deep water roll,
we sang, some voices shrill,
mine guttural,
my brother's slow as a crawl--
our voices one and several,
a visceral,
not unmagisterial,
chorale.





Grand Expensive Vista
 

As we sipped and mingled,
regaled
with oldfangled
canaps and beguiled,
or entertained at least, by gargled
oldies, I disengaged
and angled
across grass tenderly groomed,
past where electric tiki torches gleamed,
and, alone, gazed,
now truly beguiled,
at my hosts' grand
expensive vista, mortgaged,
yes, and, yes, remortgaged.
A low gold
moon glowed
against a plush black sky gauzed,
even filigreed,
with stars. Gowned
in old-growth oaks glazed
with moonlight over their autumn gilt,
the hills glowed
in concord with the golden moon. I lingered,
glad--discomfited and glad--
at what my friends' greed
for beauty afforded me. I argued,
self against self, what they'd gained
and lost, and me with them, entangled
as friendship entangles. I nearly groaned
aloud with want before my friend grabbed
my elbow. "Gorgeous, eh? I grinned
and agreed,
my voice greased
with hidden envy. From behind us, grilled
sirloin, pedigreed
meat sublimating on embers, triggered
another hunger. Life was not just good,
but too good:
aged beef, aged wine after bourbon. We hungered,
and all the way back to his engorged
glass table, hunger was our guide.





Lichen Glows in the Moonlight
 

Lichen glows in the moonlight
so fierce only cloud blocking
the moon brings relief. Then passed by,
recharged it leaps up off rocks

and suffocates--there is no route
through rocks without having to confront
its beseeching--it lights the way,
not the moon, and outdoes epithets

like phosphorescent, fluorescent, or florescent:
it smirks and smiles and lifts the corner
of its lips in hideous or blissful collusion,
and birds pipe an eternal dawn, never knowing 

when to sleep or wake. They might 
be tricked into thinking their time's up,
in the spectrum of lichen, its extra-gravital
persuasion, its crackling movement

remembered as still, indifferent, barely
living under the sun, or on a dark night;
climbing up you'd escape, but like all great
molecular weights it leaves traces

you carry with you into the realms
           of comfort and faith.





Eagle Affirmation
 

You've got to understand that sighting the pair
of eagles over the block, right over our house,
not more than twenty feet above the roof,
so massive their wings pull at the corrugated
tin sheeting even with gentlest tilt, counteracts
bitterness against all the damage I see and hear
around me on an exclusively crisp blue morning,
when clarity is pain and even one small missing
wattle tree, entirely vanquished since I was last here 
at home--I still find this hard to say--is agony; 
a region is not a pinpoint and a different compass
works in my head, having magnetics for all
directions and all pointing to one spot 
I know and observe as closely as possible; 
and even one small vanished or vanquished
wattle tree is agony close to death for me,
where I find it hard to breathe to feed myself
to get past the loss; but the pair of eagles
still appearing and keeping their sharp
and scrupulous eyes honed, overrides
this ordeal, though I wish their victims
life too and their damage is traumatic
as anything else; that's as much sense
or nonsense as I can make in such blue light.





Balloon
 

It didn't happen in that order--
the endless growl of what will turn out to be
miniature quad and trail bikes, carried along
the top of the valley and rumbling its contents:
small kids with helmets weighing more than their heads,
ragged on by parents with crossed arms and ambition
in their eyes: round and round the drone of fun.
A country pursuit. Tracy tells me a professor
of economics at a local city university
while praising capitalism says he will only
listen to opposition if it comes from one
who eats only lentils, has given up cars
and eschews imported brands of foodstuffs. Lentils?
Contradictions aside, I'll take him on, though
it might be hard to hear me speak above the junior
quad-bike circus performing along the hills. But hark,
I'll tell you something unusually usual: at dusk
wandering the block with Katherine we came across
shreds of chemical-pink balloon with plastic string
attached to its tied-off umbilical cord, clearly
an escapee from a party, the child--her name
decorating the balloon with three crosses for kisses--
in tears, chasing it up into the sky, watching
it drift over the hills, her letter to the world
a single word and her mark made over. Katherine 
asks if I recall the balloons her class back in England 
released with school name and address and how one
floated all the way over the Channel and on to Belgium
where another child picked up the shreds and deciphered
the message and wrote back; weather balloons, "hopes
and ambitions as Delmore says, but without doubt
or skepticism, in full expectation they will land
somewhere far away and bring joy to the finder.
I throw the shred of balloon away, fearing
an animal crossing the block in the dark,
night-eyed and keenly sampling the ground
and the air with its snout, will reread or misread 
the code of chemical pinkness, and like some Red 
Riding Hood in reverse, choke on the gift of chance.





It's the Little Towns I Like
 

It's the little towns I like   
with their little mills making ratchets   
and stanchions, elastic web,   
spindles, you   
name it. I like them in New England,   
America, particularly-providing   
bad jobs good enough to live on, to live in   
families even: kindergarten,   
church suppers, beach umbrellas ... The towns   
are real, so fragile in their loneliness   
a flood could come along   
(and floods have) and cut them in two,   
in half. There is no mayor,   
the town council's not prepared   
for this, three of the four policemen   
are stranded on their roofs ... and it doesn't stop   
raining. The mountain   
is so thick with water parts of it just slide   
down on the heifers--soggy, suicidal-- 
in the pastures below. It rains, it rains   
in these towns and, because   
there's no other way, your father gets in a rowboat   
so he can go to work.





A Version of Alcmans (fl. 630 BCE) "Sleep poem . . .
 

Dormant are pinnacles and streams of the mountains,
Chasms and bluffs and crawlers fed by the dark earth;
Dormant are wild animals and that tribe of bees
And monsters out of the sea's dark syntax;
Dormant are clans of birds with wings that envelop.






Mother, Washing Dishes
 

                                She rarely made us do it-- 
we'd clear the table instead--so my sister and I teased 
that some day we'd train our children right 
and not end up like her, after every meal stuck 
with red knuckles, a bleached rag to wipe and wring. 
The one chore she spared us: gummy plates 
in water greasy and swirling with sloughed peas, 
globs of egg and gravy. 
 
                                Or did she guard her place 
at the window? Not wanting to give up the gloss 
of the magnolia, the school traffic humming. 
Sunset, finches at the feeder. First sightings 
of the mail truck at the curb, just after noon, 
delivering a note, a card, the least bit of news.





The One Certain Thing
 

A day will come I'll watch you reading this.
I'll look up from these words I'm writing now--
this line I'm standing on, I'll be right here,
alive again. I'll breathe on you this breath.
Touch this word now, that one. Warm, isn't it?
 
You are the person come to clean my room;
you are whichever of my three children
opens the drawer here where this poem will go
in a few minutes when I've had my say.
 
These are the words from immortality.
No one stands between us now except Death:
I enter it entirely writing this.
I have to tell you I am not alone.
Watching you read, Eternity's with me.
We like to watch you read. Read us again.






from Revelator
 

Words torn, unseen, unseemly, scene
some far suburb's mall lot 
Summer's theme: this year's humid
--to sweat is to know--
pen squeezed too tight yields 
ink as blood or pus 
so the phrase scraped, removed 
offending thine eye: "Outsource Bush 
Against which, insource what? Who 
will do it? Most terrible

as we deplaned in Seattle

gonna--sit now still beside 
Dungeness River to spot quail 
hopping about this untrimmed garden 
as dog walkers circle back 
jet trails in dawn sky

in the mountains

I pause two poems, three
pages before book's end, first 
growl of plane's motor, sun
higher now contracts shadow, dandelion 
froth blows over cut grass 
spotted white tops of clover 
something deep purple, bell-shaped, nameless
at least to me, iamb 
what iamb, chewing endlessly until 
I realize I'll never swallow 
whatever--jays bark: first fog 
is deepest when trail ends 
at first bend in the 
river--"this in six weeks 
will all be swollen, salmon 
frantic in their competition, men 
also--on the wire-grid doorscreen 
various bugs alight at dawn

no more than a speck
with legs, I scream, you 
scream, we all scream for
that which is unnamable, unquenchable,
inconsolable (deep in one's chest 
surrounding the heart) art is 
a mode of stalking, balk 
at any configuration, at what's 
inescapably omitted, at Monticello I
very nearly wept, to imagine 
just once the president as 
the smartest, most questioning, most 
rigorous of all, no, that's 
not it either--seeing (hand 
shielding brow) the trail ahead 
is empty, the man stops 
to unleash his dogs, mist 
rises from the river--bland 
competency distributed equally among hundreds 
begets only rebellion, what winnowing 
from the first book to 
the next, the nest, mountainside 
garden fountain, yellowlegs & killdeer 
searching the mud for tasties

across the street windows emerge, 
porches, no longer just outlines, 
details, a larger jet now 
a few cars, then many, 
my penmanship more ornate today

not yet visible, they're distinct
sun & the dawn, one 
recurs while the other stretches
fans swirl slowly high overhead 
but the windchime is still

                    *     *     *

Why repair rotting kitchen now? 
Why seek, read every book 
if the flood won't quit 
even when you've left, Desire 
Desire is the answer, hunger 
never rests, geese each dawn 
now for decades circling lake 
until day's form is found
all over again, I rise 
to write, sun still hidden 
behind hills, hummingbird upon branch 
appears so still, breathe deep 
to taste air, first bart, 
first bark, squirrel's tail twitches 
causing whole branch to shake 
train's whistle deep & steady 
three echoes distinct, great shushing 
rush of traffic, white noise 
forms morning music, outside window
spider quick on his thread 
it's all about scale, bicycle's 
brakes squeal long way down
Stands on her deck naked 
to inspect the day, trumpet flower 
pod yellow, almost purple tip 
phallic before it explodes, 
red, red-orange, bright yellow center 
notebook's pages dwindle, one project 
I'll not complete, that's not 
it's point, but to stretch
even just a little, shape 
& dimension, time & dominion, 
day's echoes ricochet up hill 
canyon to canyon, every fold 
marvelous instrument my declining ear 
hears what I cannot see, 
say, sheer ecstasy of breath
each one, no two alike 
ever, audible in head's bell
sinus sounds, own teeth grinding
until jaw's muscles spasm, clench

                     *     *     *

                        Dear Los 
Angeles Dodgers, my bte noir 
not, you form the surrogate 
we so desperately need, enemy 
enema, it all comes out
in the wash, one road 
south of Dogtown, garden fenced 
to ward off deer, plums 
their skin tart, their flesh 
sweet & cool, I almost 
don't recognize the hummingbird, still 
on the almond branch, farms 
here feel vast, we missed 
a single turn, Bob speaks 
of how o becomes d 
or vice versa, Steve talks 
happily of new son, David
& I & ours eat 
around a front yard table 
just behind a small picket fence
the heat rare even here
you never see birds sleep 
hummingbird's red crown, white chest 
a view of the bay 
from the deck, audible neighbors
not really visible, someone's alarm 
reaches endless reiteration, arise, arise 
your eyes must be clear 
the sound of bart different
from day of my youth 
thin haze but no fog 
light spreads over San Francisco
clouds at first seem small 
until one speck of plane 
flies beneath, then a second 
absolutely crosswise, big truck's sticker 
reads "Give War a Chance 
Look for the gun rack 
boats sit still in bay 
who works there in silence 
only because I'm too far 
to hear, notebook reaches limit 
not unlike mind or heart 
whole family singing Beatles songs
as we drive, first thought
not your own, let alone
best, phrases weave against lines 
water comes to a boil 
squirrels wrestle in the branches
one skitters across the slanted roof 
Mount Tam silent as ever 
only seems unchanging (human scale)
clouds above have moved on 
leaving new sky, sun muted 
still amid trees, I close 
my eyes just to listen 
laughing jay, distant train, feel
instead air over hair, back
of my hand, its taste 
palpable in nostrils, eucalyptus, tea 
hummingbird responds to jay, jets 
echo heading east, sounds create 
(first sprinkler, bottle on table) 
sense of my own body 
high in the Berkeley hills





Chimera
 

I will take your stony heart and give  you one of flesh.
The wake     sewing shut those white lips    
and after    when leagues     and all behind to salt 
fell     the grateful Spaniards prayed 
It became their habit     to turn eyes     sore away
from surfeit     Rashes and abrasions of spring
leaf  stem  vine  blossom  aphid & berry stridulant
intricate and promiscuous     without the rose
or borage or pomegranate embowered
in flaunting silks on gauntlet cuffs     No
none of that repose their soldier-love required to root

     20,000 had died in Ravenna     He survived
without mark to show what he knew
how fear cramped each man solitary
inside himself until the spark that leapt     stinging
them on to violence     the grass-fire battle-frenzy
the grass that kneels to its burning
                                                      Then aftermath's
vegetable melee     limbs and bodies

But what is not threat in this contagion and panic
of green     Whores  wives  saints  sovereigns
this beach     that thick-leaved mustardy shrub     Names
he thinks     the names keep slipping

Swift     intent     armored obdurate as beetles     no one man
felt the wound of where like Adam     too late he walked

                                  *     *     *

The air     flexing     began to bruise green around them
the fresh human injury of them     Like flies
trapped in a bottle     they didn't know what to do
and carried on doing it 
while bird     by bird invisible rescinded its song
while the sun     a drop of vinegar in milk      curdled the sky
Quiet     sumptuous as pain eased by what hand
abrupt as that held in the breath
exhausted just before the witch confesses

Like an executioner     who ropes hair over hand
to bend and lengthen the neck for his ax
the wind brutalized palm trees     spun men
before it loosely as leaves in a stream
He linked arms with another
     Broken wing     Splintering oar     Chainless anchor
dragging through darkness thick with sand and water and noise
whistles  braying  drums  timbrels & ululations
Pressed all night to the porch of the storm his ear 
mistook the self's own alienated music     called it sorcery

That the fury never ended he would learn
walking the eye of its silence

After the hurricane the stunned brilliance     like a spell 
or question he woke into     waking by himself     to himself
and naked as a saint     to discover his ship
     with its ropes  tools  weapons  salves  Spain
was the anchored ship
now hoisted on planks of sunlight     over the palm-trees 
sailing out of sight     The boat sick
for such mirth
made by root  sap  riverbank & squirrel
it would return to that green oak it once had been

                                  *     *     *

In what hour of what night did he know his soul
to turn a stranger to him
Pilgrim     he will venture forth across uncertain fields
Explorer     he will cry out

                                            He may be nothing more
than a hide rigid with gore & soil to be 
scoured  pounded  abused by caustics and by iron
and     in watered pigeon-shit     kneaded until supple
for the hand--
                          but whose     and must
the hand continue to wear     or it will toughen again

                                   *     *     *

Daily he marched his men into corrugations of
blue distances dissolving one to another    like promises
of gold & corn made by guides snatched from villages 
As the Spanish found new ways to die     natives 
loomed     naked on the horizon they looked
splendid & violent as idols     Their women & children
restored for ransoms of melons or fish

Often some chief would repeat his good friend
possessed more of each thing they desired     His noble gestures
spread like balm     his speech intoxicating
but so militant their hunger     his words came entire 
& legible to their sense as the amber & musk that steamed
from these his fine furs

                                  *     *     *

His dwindling force
through swamps & ambush labored     circuitous     stalled
like mayflies in their brevity & towarding and never
fable  riches  youth  nor rest to take
                                                        Only the body
with its anxious extremeties     eccentric     naked
not natural     from which a vein of fascinated shame
opened darkly     glittering     smoldering 
like sea-coal     Every eye interrogated
Each inquisitor humiliated
by these echoes of himself     his body violating
the silence

                                  *     *     *

Now alone and exposed     approaching
he amassed his ocherous archive of blister
and of bruise     the old fabulous 
atlas of faith in blood & smoke redrawn

Still even the most exacting map dreams
omits & lies brindled
                                with sums & suppositions

Every step makes him more wilderness
He goes interiorly
to trade conches  sea-snails & screw-beans
for red-dyed deer-tail tassels and the arrow-makers'
sinew & flint between ragged bands
surrounded by enemies     enthralled by visions
that command them to bury their sons alive
Girls whose marriages would multiply their foes 
become meat for their dogs     
Where were the jades  turquoises  zinzibar Where
the sacred monsters  cannibals  or kings fielding legions
of dog-headed warriors
                                       Husbands groaned
bucked by pain onto the dirt when wives gave birth
& both sexes wept 
strenuously after any absence     overjoyed to see each other 
again in no essential changed

Had any man traveled farther than he

                                  *     *     *

Whether time is the ripening of fruit     the dying of fish
& the position of stars     or all
the king's clocks ringing his will upon the quarter-hour
hunger is the self's severe eternal god
From desert skies could be harvested evanescing 
bounties     dove  rabbit  wild boar  mountain lion
when for two months the natives drank bad water
and ate only oysters
                                 Or salamanders  ants  dirt  
deer dung but also many days without
To suffer only this much
demands devotion     or the ingenuity of the wasp
which deposits eggs in the walking nursery of a spider

A single brief season happy to know enough
everyone was summoned by neat cornet-shaped fruits
the prickly pear     migrating north     as it sweetened
from parrot through orchid
What use ambition in the desert     or will
The pangs can shrink but never close

                                  *     *     *

He came late to healing     Even a stone     
they said possessed its virtue and how could he     
as well so different from themselves     solicit less
Left within his heart     sealed     it might sour
                                     Farther they starved him
The power grew     Passed along from tribe to tribe
intangible economy of magic
increased by use

Fright filled some with a lassitude they withered on
others suffered cramps  headaches     or had been struck
by a sorrow     a terror     a surfeit
Blessing each joint with a cross and that something
of him might be spent on the hurt
he breathed over it     Just a little game he played to eat
before his mind emptied     stroking down & up the air
like a kingfisher 
under the shadow of the vaulting falcon that played it 
When he lifted his hands     his fingers 
glowed like ten lamps of fire     Why not be all
fire

                                  *     *     *

How much can I change before I am changed
It has been years     so long 
without abradings of any other to recall him

Dilation     digression     by these ways he will return

Natives said he could not be 
Christian     whose eyes they felt crawl over them
as if where women & men had stood was
desolating space     His own people turned 
away     warding off this apparition of a new fault
in themselves     This man

neither their stone houses
nor the need that stirs the fox's miles     nor the moon
following     which laid down his bones
to scry the distances in him     but as though
pierced by some small passive wingless insect
whose gall     blighting him
would concealed suckle & multiply its question
down a thousand generations
he was that
                  which they'd feared most to find
now abject     now famous

Twice a year his skin like muslin     pulled from his body
Without armor or felted wool or hide afterward
he was now discovered
small  pricked  loose & unpleated     opening
to manifold injury & errand

A channel for pain and a channel for hearing






Have You Eaten of the Tree?
 

And the fourth river is the Euphrates
The first day was a long day
and the first night nearly eternal.
No thing existed, and only One was present
to perceive what wasn't there.
No meaning as we know it;
difference was bound in the All.
On the first day, water, 
on the second day, land, 
on the third day, two kinds of light,
one of them night.
On the fourth day, laughter, 
and darkness saw it was good.  
But when God laughed,
a crack ran through creation. 
On the fourth night, sorrow,
staring away from heaven,
torn in its ownness.
No evidence then of nothing,
but worlds upon worlds,
underwritten, overflowing:
the worlds of fear and of longing,
lacking in belief,
and the pitiful world of love, 
forever granting its own wishes.
Out of dust, like golems, 
God created man and woman,
and cast them into chance.
And man was subdued in those days.
All that could leap, leapt;
all that could weep, wept.
First of all places, Eden;
last of all places, Cleveland;
and a river flowed out of Eden,
inspiring in the dry land 
a panic of growth and harvest season.
The newly formed creation
took from flesh its beast
and from each word its sentence.
And early loves and hatreds blew
from thistle to thorn.
Each thing that God created,
he placed before man
so that he may name it:
cloudbank, hawk's eye, lambkin,
and for each thing that man made,
God provided the name:
andiron, Nietzsche, corporation.
All speak of pain 
subtle in its clamor, 
as when the child, dying,
sinks into its skin
as under public snow.
Heartrending, each termination;
God-shaken, each beginning.
At the dawn of smoke,
pungent as creation, 
the long chaos rises over these trees.
For we opened our eyes in Eden,
with the taste of fruit on our lips.

(Genesis)






Gods Promises
 

I, the Lord, will make barren
your fields and your fairways.
Your refrigerators will be empty,
no steaks and no leg bones,
no butter and no cornbread.
And I will remove your screen doors, 
force the mosquitoes indoors
where you lie on the bed undead.
For my house you have not readied,
no flat screen and no broadband.
My habitation is a wasteland
of furniture from motel rooms.
I will send the ostrich and badger
in herds through your wrecked rooms; 
your beds will be entered by turnstile;
the floor will seethe with bees.
For my house is but a prefab; 
its roof lets in my rain.
Woe is the Lord of Heaven
who has no mansion on earth.
Cries are heard from my fish traps,
crows flap on my hat rack,
pandemonium at the threshold
as the owls and bats flit in.
Silence reigns in the last place
and the first place has no sway.
For my knife-edge is impatient,
my ledge crumbles like cake.
I have warned you to beware.
You await a handsome savior,
but the plain man draws near...

(Zephaniah)






To the Choirmaster
 

Art thou not from everlasting,       O Lord my God, my Holy One?             We shall not die.
The rock lives in the desert, solid, taking its time.
The wave lives for an instant, stable in momentum
at the edge of the sea, before it folds away.
Everything that is, lives and has size.
The mole sleeps in a hole of its making, 
and the hole also lives; absence is not nothing.
It didn't desire to be, but now it breathes
and makes a place, for the comfort of the mole.
I am a space taken, and my absence will be shapely
and of a certain age, in the everlasting.
In the fierce evening, on the mild day,
How long shall I be shaken?

(Habakkuk)






If Briefly
 

Sometimes in time's near
unassailable sangfroid there is
a thawing
& the memory
asserts its musicality again

reminds one that it is at heart
heart's artificer

                    *     *     *

Somewhere in Okinawa there are stairs

"My husband is the only
constant in

are concrete stairs that lead one
(or at least led me, age six)
near straight from top to bottom of a cliff face
& they ended in a black-sand beach

                      "the only
constant in my life.

When I was young I would have thought

I would regret it, to have wrapped
myself up like a caterpillar
in a man--but if my name, like his,
is Vogelsang, then I must half recede
with him

& only half of me is Julia. And that fades too.

So call me, if
you call me, Mrs. Vogelsang.

At that age, having lived before in Florida,
it seemed like
                      a miraculous affront
                                     that a beach
could shuffle off the purity of sand

& satisfying to have seen it after the descent
of stairs

at least three hundred, each laborious
at six
my body hardly large enough to bear
its density in time--

Knowing little, still I felt
exhilaration that a new piece of world
would stand (if briefly) out of time

& therefore out of me
if I am what I occupy of it

. . . The body hates to be discounted
in this way, says it encloses
any love the heart pretends to, 
like the stairs,
a downward tedium but still the necessary
setting of the beach, as gems
are set in rings that,

though of precious metals, lack
the brilliance of the gems
& go unnoticed, though they lift
the whole from what it risks--

                     *     *     *

          "At the onset of my husband's
impotence I thought myself in part
if not entirely
responsible, & I ascribed the blame

to our, admittedly, unsensational sex habits,
to our bed not cold, perhaps, but let's be frank

a little bored with us. Therefore,

thirty-eight & only just confronted with
my inexperience that bordered on

extended childhood, I contemplated, then resolved
to take his penis in my mouth.

It was not lightly I decided this. I am,

perhaps, anachronistic--though no prude,
my husband & I, if you will excuse
vulgarity, fucked constantly when young
& not infrequently until this roadblock--but

it struck me somehow as
unseemly hitherto. My husband

when I told him what I meant to do
looked pleased, as though
decorum only kept him

twenty years long
from requesting it. He tried
to guide me
as I started, both his hands
like tethers not unkind to what they hold--

And he was kind to me, spoke kindly as I ran
my tongue across him, tasting faintly
of his sweat but not unpleasant. On the whole

not bad to do this, though
my faith flagged somewhat

as his prick lay flaccid in my mouth,

its stubbornness
infuriating. I could feel his disappointment,

selfish maybe but no more so
than is fair in love, for he, of course,
was not a stranger to this act.

No sense in skipping what embarrasses: 
I knew at least once

in the time since our marriage he
had been with someone else, though

it had been a while by now.
She had told me, long my friend

& full of guilt. I told her
bitterness was foreign to me
(which is almost true)

that she shouldn't
worry, though I'd rather that she not
encourage him to seek a second

tryst. Not much by then
that I could do to change what they
had done--& I believed

at that time, as I said, I was
responsible, could mend it
so he'd never feel the need
to cheat again. Can't know now

whether I was right, though sometimes
I consider asking him--as I considered

then, but as I built my courage up
he stiffened. 

And I threw
my heart into the act, as one

who plows the earth with spite for it,
his anger lightening his labor, that

the ground break open for
his putting in the seed. I will not
lie fallow always though

my body rot.

                  --the thick
warmth running in my mouth like
bitter salt dissolved in water,

like the ocean beautiful
though full of bloated fish.

                     *     *     *

Looking at the ocean, it
does not at first cohere     the waves

seem merely limits that the eyes have introduced, imposed
to force a pattern
on enormity
                 which one

does not encounter often made particular

--& we are in it
where we cautiously avoid the undertow

Time made us, time

will make us till we tire of it absolutely
what we are . . . & still so thin the slightest

puncture tears this curtain
of a body off me     Then I am
as one who, secretly
a part, participant, of it

pretends to volunteer to vanish at
a state-fair magic show that claims a
charm in its predictability

                     *     *     *

             "My love
consoles me greatly
but is love no less for that

because it is an undertaking

not myself but with a bit of me
in it.

                    *     *     *

What I can see beyond
my eyes is my invention
half as much
as it is real, if real

means anything apart from
subject to invention. Though
as makers we might

deign to praise this
still one must admit it grows
at times exhausting
to remake the world in
every sighting of it.

I suspect you know
as well as I do
that desire we might feel
sometime subjected to another's

presence is a sort
of longing to experience the object--
And sometimes we

experience it, sometimes
that experience
is burdensome. Then we hash
the matter over, celebrate

the isolation
one cannot alleviate through
laughter, set the problem
to the side. Friendship,

unlike love, will not destroy us
therefore is not penance. But
what eases hurting also serves
& can we rightly blame

the sun for what evaporates
between the intervals of rain?

                    *     *     *

"And if my love is only my invention
that is unimportant
since to say I love him
therefore makes it so.

To be content is to be so
by choice--my friend,
when she had told me that he came
inside her crying

choked with guilt & pleasure
which we all know will intoxicate when mixed,

was simply unaware that happiness
is mine by right if I declare it,
like the moon with our absurd flag.

                    *     *     *

In Okinawa also
--I cannot remember
where this lies in time, before
the black-sand beach
or after--I awoke

at two o'clock one morning, sick,
unable to return to sleep,

never having woken up so early,
having never understood that two o'clock

is full dark stretched
like gauze across one corner of
the earth. My father took me
somewhere with him, maybe

there was someone he had told he'd meet
& likely told me, but my memory has found
no use for it--we stood outside the car

under streetlights in a parking lot
near home, & while he spoke
with some man wholly wiped

from time I've known, I watched
a dozen dragonflies fly circles
underneath the streetlight,
& I knew the time of day in which I stood
was new & tried to watch the dragonflies

with desperate attention,
knowing two o'clock was something that
existed now with being's stony smirk.

One doesn't see
these things again.






Mirror, Mirror
 

What do we do when we hate our bodies?
A good coat helps.
Some know how to pull off a hat.

And there are paints, lighting, knives, needles,
various kinds of resignation,
the laugh in the mirror, the lie

of saying it doesn't matter.
There is also the company we keep:
surgeons and dermatologists,

faith healers and instruction-givers,
tailors of cashmere and skin
who send their bills for holding

our shame-red hands, raw
from the slipping rope,
the same hands with which we tremble

ever so slightly, holding novels in bed,
concentrating on the organization
of pain and joy

we say is another mirror,
a depth, a conjure in which we might meet
someone who says touch me.





A Possum Entering the Argument
 

We're talking about
when we met
and you say

it was easier
to fall for me thinking
(I'll remember

this pause)
it was likely I'd be
dead by now.

Talking. Falling.
Thinking. Waiting . . .
Have I 

undone 
what you've tried to do?
You say no.

You say the surprise
of still being
is something

being built--
the machine of our living,
this saltwork of luck,

stylish, safe,
comfortable and 
unintended.

Meanwhile, I haven't
had the opportunity
to tell you, but

our lovely little dog
has just killed 
a possum.

Maybe it's unfair,
a possum entering
the argument here.

But I lay it down
before us:
because an ugly

dying  possum
played dead
and didn't run,

its dubious cunning
was brought to an end
outside our door

by our brutal, beautiful
and very pleased
little dog.

So how do I say
that this is not
about death or sadness

or even whether
you really
first loved me

waiting, thinking
I'd be
dying young?

It's just that 
standing there 
a few minutes ago

holding a dead possum
by its repellent
bony tail,

I was struck by how
eerily pleased I was
to be a spectator

to teeth, spit,
agony and claw,
feeling full of purpose,

thinking how different
in our adversaries
we are from possums.

We try love--
the fist of words,
their opening hand.

And whether we play
dead or alive,
our pain, the slow

circulation of happiness,
our salt and work,
the stubborn questions

we endlessly
give names to
haunt us with choice.





Ignatz Invoked
 

A gauze bandage wraps the land
and is unwound, stained orange with sulfates.

A series of slaps molds a mountain,
a fear uncoils itself, testing its long

cool limbs. A passing cloud
seizes up like a carburetor

and falls to earth, lies broken-
backed and lidless in the scree.

Acetylene torches now snug
in their holsters, shop-vacs

trundled back behind the dawn.
A mist becomes a murmur, becomes

a moan deepening the dust-
choked fissures in the rock O pity us

Ignatz O come to us by moonlight
O arch your speckled body over the earth.





Ersatz Ignatz
 

The clockwork saguaros sprout extra faces like planaria stroked by
               a razor. Chug

say the sparrows, emitting fluffs of steam. Chug chug say the piston-powered
               ground squirrels.

The tumbleweeds circle on retrofitted tracks, but the blue pasteboard welkin
               is much dented by little winds.

The yuccas pulse softly under the grow-light sconces.

Here is the door he will paint on the rock.

Here is the glass floor of the cliff.

He'll enter from the west, backlit in orange isinglass, pyrite
            pendants glinting from the fringes of his voice.

Ignatz Domesticus
 

Then one day she noticed the forest had begun to bleed into her waking life.

There were curved metal plates on the trees to see around corners.

She thought to brush her hand against his thigh.

She thought to trace the seam of his jeans with her thumbnail.

The supersaturated blues were beginning to pixillate around the edges, to
               become a kind of grammar.

She placed a saucer of water under her lamp and counted mosquitoes as
               they drowned.

Soot amassed in drifts in the corners of the room.

She pressed her thumb into the hollow of his throat for a while and then 
               let him go.





Dream Carp
 

People traveled from miles away to see
my paintings of fish--
the jeweled armor of their scales, the beadlike

set of their eyes in
rubbery socket rings, the glimmering
swish of fin and tail

so real it seemed that you could almost dip
a net deep into
the paper and pull up the arching wet

weight of a golden carp,
a shiny trout, or the dark muscular
heft of a bass with

its mouth stretched into the surprised, wiry
"oh of a child's wind
sock. I captured my models from the sea,

lake, and goldfish pond
in the back garden, so careful not to
let their mouths be torn

by the hook, their scales chipped, or the silky
tissue of their tails
ripped by a clumsy hand. I kept them in

large glass bowls, fed them
mosquito wings or dry silkworm pupas
offered from chopsticks,

and when I was finished making sketches,
I quickly took them
back and set them free again. Every

night I dream I swim
with these fish as a golden carp--black spots
on cloisonn scales,

pulled to the surface by the deceptive
creamy luster of
the moon or the sizzle of firefly lights

across the water.
And every night I am tempted once
again by the smell

of the baited hook, by my predictable
hunger for earthly
things, and each time I am surprised again

by the stinging hook
in my lip that pulls me mercilessly
into the bright air,

setting my gills on fire, the sharp, silver
pain of the knife that
slits me open so easily from tail

to throat to reveal
the scarlet elastic of my raw gills,
the translucent film

of my air sac, the milky rise of my
stomach, and the gray
marbled coil of my intestines. I rise

late each day, and work
in brighter light. When I die, I will
have my paintings brought

down to the lake and slipped into the water.
First the edges of
ink will blur, and then there will be a great

flurry as the fins,
tails, and bodies begin blossoming in-
to life again, each

fish detaching from its canvas of silk
or rice paper--a 
swirl of color, motion, swimming away.





Happy Hour
 

I always forget the name,
delphinium,
even though it was the flower

the hummingbirds
loved best. They came in pairs--sleek,
emerald-bright

heads, the clockwork machinery
of their blurred wings
thrumming swift, menacing engines.

They slipped their beaks.
as if they were swizzle sticks, deep
into the blue

throat of delphinium and sucked
dry the nectar-
chilled hearts like goblets full of sweet,

frozen daiquiri.
I liked to sit on the back porch
in the evenings,

watching them and eating Spanish
peanuts, rolling
each nut between thumb and forefinger

to rub away
the red salty skin like brittle
tissue paper,

until the meat emerged gleaming,
yellow like old
ivory, smooth as polished bone.

And late August,
after exclamations of gold
flowers, tiny

and bitter, the caragana
trees let down their
beans to ripen, dry, and rupture--

at first there was
the soft drum of popcorn, slick with oil,
puttering some-

where in between seed, heat, and cloud.
Then sharp cracks like cap
gun or diminutive fireworks,

caragana
peas catapulting skyward like
pellet missiles.

Sometimes a meadowlark would lace
the night air with
its elaborate melody,

rippling and sleek
as a black satin ribbon. Some-
times there would be

a falling star. And because
this happened in
Wyoming, and because this was

my parents' house,
and because I'm never happy
with anything,

at any time, I always wished
that I was some-
where, anywhere else, but here.






Transplanting
 

For my mother, Yoshiko Horikoshi Roripaugh
1. X-Ray

My mother carried the chest x-ray
in her lap on the plane, inside
a manila envelope that read
Do Not Bend and, garnished
with leis at the Honolulu Airport,
waited in line--this strange image
of ribcage, chain-link vertebrae,
pearled milk of lung, and the murky
enigmatic chambers of her heart
in hand. Until it was her turn
and the immigration officer held
the black-and-white film up
to sun, light pierced clean through
her, and she was ushered from one
life through the gate of another,
wreathed in the dubious and illusory
perfume of plucked orchids.


2. Ceramic Pig

Newly arrived in New Mexico,
stiff and crisp in new dungarees,
her honeymoon, they drove
into the mountains in a borrowed car,
spiraling up and up toward the rumor
of deer, into the green tangy turpentine
scent of pine, where air crackled
with the sizzling collision of bees,
furred legs grappling velvet bodies
as they mated midair, and where
they came upon the disconsolate gaze
of a Madonna alcoved against
the side of the road, her feet wreathed
in candles, fruit, flowers, and other
offerings. Nearby, a vendor
with a wooden plank balanced between
two folding chairs and the glossy
row of ceramic pigs lined up across,
brilliant glaze shimmering the heat.
My mother fell in love with the red-
and-blue splash of flowers tattooed
into fat flanks and bellies, the green
arabesques of stem and leaf circling
hoof, snout, and ear. So exotic.
Years later she still describes the pig
with a sigh--heartbroken, the word
she chooses with careful consideration.
She'd filled the pig with Kennedy dollars
from the grocery budget, each half dollar
a small luxury denied at the local
Piggly Wiggly, until one day, jingling
the shift and clink of the pig's
growing silver weight, she shook
too hard, and as if the hoarded wealth
of her future were too much to contain,
the pig broke open--spilling coins
like water, a cold shiny music, into her lap--
fragments of bright pottery shards
scattering delicate as Easter eggshell.


3. Sneeze

My mother sneezes in Japanese. K-sho!
An exclamation of surprise--two sharp
crisp syllables before pulling out
the neatly folded and quartered tissue
she keeps tucked inside the wrist
of her sweater sleeve. Sometimes,
when ragweed blooms, I wonder why
her sneeze isn't mine, why something
so involuntary, so deeply rooted
in the seed of speech, breaks free from
my mouth like thistle in a stiff breeze,
in a language other than my mother's 
tongue. How do you chart the diaspora
of a sneeze? I don't know how
you turned out this way, she always
tells me, and I think that we are each
her own moon--one face in shadow,
undisclosed seas and surprising mountains,
rotating in the circular music
of separate spheres, but held in orbit
by the gravitational muscle
of the same mercurial spinning heart. 


4. Dalmatian

There is an art to this. To shish
kebab the varnished pit of avocado
on three toothpicks above a pickle jar
of cool water, tease down the pale
thirsty hairs of root until one sinewy
arm punches up and unclenches its green
fisted hand, palm open, to the sun.
To discern the oniony star-struck
subterfuge of bulbs, their perverse
desires, death-like sleeps, and conspire
behind the scenes to embroider
the Elizabethan ruffles and festoons
of their flamboyant resurrections.
To trick the tomatoes into letting down
their swelling, tumescent orbs
in the cottony baked heat of the attic
until their sunburnt faces glow
like round orange lanterns under
the crepuscular twilight of the eaves.
Unwrapping the cuttings of succulents
from their moist, paper-towel bandages,
and snugging them down into firm
dimples of dirt and peat, coaxing up
the apple-green serpentine coils of sweet
pea with a snake charmer's song to wind
around the trellis and flicker their quick
pink-petaled tongues. The tender slips
of mint, sueded upturned bells of petunia,
and slim fingers of pine that pluck
the metal window screen like a tin harp
by the breakfast nook where my father
stirs his morning coffee and waits
for the neighbors' Dalmatian to hurl
itself over the back fence and hang,
limply twisting and gasping on the end
of its chain and collar like a polka-dotted
petticoat, until my father goes outside
and takes its baleful kicking weight
in his arms and gently tosses it back
over the fence into the neighbors' yard.
Year after year, the dandelions
and clover are weeded out, summers
come and go, and roots stubbornly inch
down around the foundation of the house--
labyrinthine, powerful and deep.


5. Japanese Apple

She was given an apple on the plane,
round and fragrant with the scent
of her grandfather's fruit orchards
during autumn, when chestnuts
dropped from their trees and struck
the metal rooftop like the small heavy
tongues of bells, and black dragon-
flies like quick shiny needles darted
in and out of the spin and turn
of leaves fluttering down like soft
bright scraps of silk. She wrapped
the apple in a napkin to save
for later, and it was confiscated
at customs before she had the chance 
for even a taste. Over the years it
seemed to grow larger, yellower, juicier
and more delicious, and even though
there were burnished rows of apples
stacked in gleaming pyramids
at the supermarket with quaint
names like Macintosh, Winesap,
and Granny Smith, and even though
there were sunlit apple orchards
at my American grandfather's ranch,
where rattlesnakes slumbered
in the heat and redolence of fruit
flesh, frightening the horses,
she sampled one after another,
but they never tasted as sweet
or as bright as the apple taken from her,
the one she had to leave behind.





Zoo
 

Ga       The fishy consonant,
Na     The monkey vowel.

Da     The immigrant's tongue
          as shrill or guttural.

Overture of my voice like the flash of bats.
The hyena babble and apish libretto.

Piscine skin, unblinking eyes.
Sideshow invites foreigner with the animal hide.

Alveolar tt, sibilant ss, and glottal hh

shi:               poem
kkatchi:       magpie
ayi:               child

Words with an atavistic tail. History's thorax considerably
cracked. The Hottentot click called undeveloped.

Mother and Father obsessed with hygiene:
as if to rid themselves of their old third world smell.

Labial bs and palatal ts:

La        the word
Ma       speaks
Ba        without you

I dreamed a Korean verse, a past conversation
with Mother when they said I was blathering unintelligibly
in my sleep.

The mute girl with the baboon's face unlearned
her vowels and cycled across a rugged phonetic map.

Sa      glossary
Ah      din
Ja       impossible word

Macaws turned into camouflaged moths.
The sky was overcast, the ocean a slate gray

along the wolf-hued sand. I dived into the ocean
swam across channels to islands without flags;

replaced the jingoist's linotype with my yellowing
canines and shrilled against the anemic angel who

cradled the bells that dictated time and lucid breath.





Body Builder
 

I can no longer blush. Half-face towards the starchy scape.
Birds limn the spindle trees, their Listerine-hued eyes dart
as they trill mechanical dirges tabulating not again, not
again /  I can no longer blush. The flat arctic sky
boundlessly jogs to another hemisphere / She grows!
Or her pectoral grows or all her pectorals grow / A drop of body
oil the size of a water balloon splooshes down on a man as a graceless
anointing, atomizing into tears / How delicate the sounds are from
her height! Glottal roses wink out of their throats: their voices
tine/ Now I am blushing / Swamp moss draped over the arcades / Oh
she'll topple. She's making for the welkin / swamps massage
the plywood foundations of our houses / And speaking of / she shoots
up not like a beanstalk but a city erected quick-time / and speaking
of, I blush blood / Roiling up past 200 ft, dizzy from all that phosphagen / I
be damned where she gits all that nylon, the size of wedding tents!/ She
flexes for her audience / Naugahide. Fuel injection. A sawed-off
shotgun will do you nothing just the rat-a-tat-tat / Rabelaisian
bullhonkies hunker and tinker tents around her / Roiling,
flexing / are louts without a law to bless them / a shadow
overcast / a footstep is a swamp in which gators pop up like whack-
a-mole carnival games / what are they saying? do they marvel?/ I am
hemorrhaging flames! / she aims with her thumb.





All the Aphrodisiacs
 

blowfish arranged on a saucer. Russian roulette. angelic slivers.

ginseng. cut antlers allotted in bags dogs on a spit, a Dutch girl

winking holds a bowl of shellfish.

white cloth, drunkenness. a different language leaks out--
the idea of throat, an orifice, a cord--

you say it turns you on when I speak Korean.

The gold paste of afterbirth, no red--

Household phrases          --pae-go-p'a     (I am hungry)
                                             --ch'i-wa          (Clean up)
                                             --kae sekki       (Son of a dog)

I breathe those words in your ear, which make you climax; 
                      
afterwards you ask me for their translations. I tell you it's a secret.

gijek niin tigit rril--the recitation of the alphabet; guttural diphthong, gorgeous.

What are the objects that turn me on: words--
       
han-gul: the language first used by female entertainers, poets, prostitutes.

The sight of shoes around telephone wires, pulleyed by their laces, the
               blunt word cock.           
      
Little pink tutus in FAO Schwarz,
when I was four they used to dress me as a boy,

white noise, whitewashed. the whir of ventilation in the library.

Even quarantined amongst books, I tried to kiss you once.

Strips of white cotton, the color of the commoner, the color of virtue,
the color that can be sullied-- 

my hand pressed against your diaphragm, corralling your pitch,

a pinch of rain caught between mouths,

analgesic, tea. poachers drawing blood-- 

strips of white cotton I use to bind your wrist to post, tight
enough to swell vein, allow sweat--

sweat to sully the white of your sibilant body,

the shrug of my tongue, the shrug of command, sssshhht.





Hottentot Venus
 

Overheard in the heat, the air, the fruit fly's drone
of the perfect helix, overheard in science's repartee

of right and wrong, in the gossip of perfumed women
basking in London's charmless sun,

Overheard in the gasps of penny sideshows, the formulas
of doctors summing up freaks in taxidermic clinics,

Overheard in the echo of cubic hallways,
in the speculum's wand first tested on the slave woman,

Overheard in history's senile tympanum

was a Song.

Rain irrigating fact, jars mapping name,
Recollect my throat, my organs, my bones






Oswald Spengler Watches the Sunset
 

The air is drenched with day, but one by one
           The flowers close on cue,
Obedient to the declining sun.
Forest and grasses, bush and leaf and stem,
They cannot move (and nor, you dream, can you);
           It is the wind that plays with them.
Only the little midges dancing still
           Against the evening move at will.

This tiny swarm still dancing on and on
           Like something in a net
Expanding and contracting, that late swan
Towing its wake, a solitary crow
Crossing the twilight in its silhouette,
           The fox proceeding sly and slow:
They are small worlds of purpose which infuse
           The world around with will to choose.

An animalcule in a drop of dew--
           And so diminutive
That if the human eye should look clear through
That globe there would be nothing there to see--
Although it only has a blink to live,
           Yet in the face of this is free;
The oak, in whose vast foliage this dot
           Hangs from a single leaf, is not.






The House of Time
 

And fleetingly it seemed to him
That in between one eye blink and the next
Time paused, allowing time to be installed
Within that countless interim,
Coiled up, on hold,
A memory predicted and recalled.
Now, that weak muscle flexed,
All that contained him started to unfold

In front of him, a moving book
In three dimensions he could wander through,
At will, at any point, now, since, before,
To feel, to listen and to look--
A house, or suite
Of rooms around a circling corridor,
And waiting there, he knew,
Were all the peopled days he'd not repeat.

Slowly he stretched his hand to open
The first door on his right. Why, this was easy:
Christmas when he was seven, and his aunt
Playing a polonaise by Chopin,
Badly. "Lenore,
We know you think you can, dear, but you can't.
And he was resting, queasy
From too much pudding. Now, another door:

So far, so faint, not yet an I,
A pulse of sense, he hung upon a web
Of knitted blood. Above, the muffled heart
Performed its mindless lullaby 
And in the womb
He slept on half awake. That was his part
Elsewhere, too, at the ebb
Of his last consciousness. Another room:

He recognized at once the face
Of one who five years hence he would have bound
As closely to him as a Siamese twin.
How recklessly he would replace
That loving care.
Absorbed, now, in the dream of skin on skin,
He whispered the profound
And destined promises she'd never share.

He shuddered, shut it, and proceeded.
So room on room, all of his scenes, arranged
In simultaneous succession, played
Before him, unignored, unheeded,
Each a tableau
Vivant and drama, driven and yet stayed,
Developing, unchanged.
At last the time that paused for time to flow

He saw was coming to an end.
He saw himself before himself, distinct
As when--a life ago--it came to him
A single blink could comprehend,
And then unfold,
All time within that countless interim.
He blinked. And then he blinked.
And time continued as it coiled, on hold.





Saccade
 

They have no sense of what they're looking at,
Unless the object moves.
(Or so he's read; who knows if that's the case?)
A painted bird's an empty analogue
To the oblivious cat.
And it is not his still familiar face
So much as that distinctive gait which proves
The master to his dog,
Who frolics for him like an acrobat.

His eyes need movement too, but make their own.
His most fixated gaze--
On one small figure in a Bruegel scene,
Or on the camber of his lover's lip
He worships unbeknown,
As though no time or change will supervene--
Aflicker with saccade, adjusts and strays
Minutely to equip
His mind to take in what is being shown.

And maybe consciousness employs saccade
As well, and flickers back
And forth, now in the world, now, briefly, out--
The way the gum tree's canopy overhead
Flickers with light and shade,
So every leaf is momently in doubt--
Its faith saved by such intermittent lack
From being surfeited,
Its constant sense being constantly unmade.






The Labyrinth
 

Torn turned and tattered
Bowed burned and battered
I took untensed time by the teeth
And bade it bear me banking
Out over the walled welter
                                           cities and the sea
Through the lightsmocked birdpocked cloudcocked sky
To leave me light on a lilting planetesimal.

The stone walls wailed and whimpered
The bold stars paled and dimpled
Godgone time gathered to a grunt 
And bore me bled and breaking
On past parted palisades
                                           windrows and the trees
Over a windcloaked nightsoaked starpoked sea
To drop me where? Deep in a decadent's dream.








Elegy: In Coherent Light
 

In memory of two English poets, Matt Simpson and Michael Murphy, d. 2009

Teach-cheap, teach-cheap, teach-cheap, teach-cheap--
Sparrows are plying their chisels in the summer ivy,
Chipping the seconds spark by spark out of the hours.
I read in each whistling chip the sun's holography.
My brain's a film, I'm made of timed exposures,
And pounding my ears and eyes with waves of light--
These animate flakes, these pictures I call sight.

But now you're out of the picture, no one can keep
Coherent sightings of you, except in language.
All the warm rhetoric is wrong. Death isn't sleep.
Faith in eternal love is love's indulgence.
I prize what you wrote and meet you in what I write.
We still keep house in a living tenement of words.
Pull down their walls of ivy, and you kill the birds. 






The Miracle of the Bees and the Foxgloves
 

Because hairs on their speckled daybeds baffle the little bees,
foxgloves come out to advertise for rich bumbling hummers,
who crawl into their tunnels-of-delight with drunken ease
(see Darwin's chapters on his foxglove summers) 
plunging over heckles caked with sex-appealing stuff
to sip from every hooker its intoxicating liquor
and stop it propagating in a corner with itself.

And this is how the foxflower keeps its sex life in order. 
Two anthers--adolescent, in a hurry to dehisce--
let fly too soon, so pollen lies in drifts around the floor.  
Along swims bumbler bee and makes an undercoat of this,
reverses, exits, lets it fall by accident next door.  
So ripeness climbs the bells of Digitalis, flower by flower,
undistracted by a Mind, or a Design, or by desire.






Lines Written on Nursery Wall
 

           You bring a stalk of bamboo 
                       to the flu room.
                       Hot pink Buddha offers
           some bullet-like pills from his plastic
fingers. Oh high above the pecan
tree, my dead grandfather
  walks Basil and Maestro, our two 
standard poodles. One's beard is oily
  from the wheel
of brie he's stolen from 
the kitchen counter. 

       The world works. Even from here.
                  I can hear the buzz
                  of machines, the clicks
                             of pens, the secretary's
                                          repressed anger
                                         (bites the inside of her cheek),
                              the weird light of computer screens.

        The world works wonders: the cashier at 
                       Kmart rings up
                another self-tanning lotion. She rings
                           up August, the ocean, a string
                             bikini on younger flesh. Nude on bronze. 
                                       Saltwater fish. 

                 The sand is piled high.
                          It makes a wave over the pecan tree.
                            Soon a tsunami will wash away the house, nursery.

                                        Nothing left but a palm frond,
                                        white long bone. 

                      Goodbye dog, tree, grandfather
                      with your elk-tipped cane. 

                      The world works 
          but not today. Not for me. Fever and the walls
                      painted with sharks and starfish.

                                There is so much aqua, histamine. 

                                           Buddha, bring me another
                                           slice of pineapple.





Landscape Made From Egg and Sperm
 

Because Yosemite's high altitude lake's 
             tadpoles wash up in
                         glow-in-the-dark condoms
             and every fish lip has a hook in it. Because 
                             there's bird shit
                             in the clouds. Things catch, get caught. 
                                        Things are consumed. 
                             There's no looking
                                        back. And so you

                                        were conceived here, Ezekiel, fifty 
                             feet off the Trail of 
                        Broken Ankles. We wanted
                   to make sure no one
                              would see. The one hiker
                                         who saw looked away. 
                                         Amino acids
                                         of the flushed cheek. Dirge 
                                                   for eyeless things. I washed
                                                   my body in the river
                                                              and the river went numb--
                                                   the mind sunburned. 

                                                   I imagine the second
                                                   before you took, before
                                                       the cells began to split,
                                                   before that flint
                                                   was struck, before the dna
                                                             began to twist, 
                                        that a colorless emptiness
                           suddenly inverted 
                   and told the world that he, too,
                                        once had a mother. 

                                         But there is no nest of leaves. Nothing
                                         stops. The clock in the glacier
                                         still ticks above us
                              and on our skin
                   there were enormous ants, the segments
                               of their bodies  
                               like black droplets of paint 
                                               pushed very close against each other
                                                      but still not touching, yet

                                                      taking their work with them--
                                                      taking away their dirt world.





Beginning With an Acute Stab of Nostalgia, It Gets Worse and Worse
 

I called Hart on my longer distance line
And in case you didn't know he is in heavine.
Hart, I implored, I searched your book
(Yes, you have a Collected) and could fine
Nothing about the 36 cast iron bridges in
Central Park, why didn't you write about one
At least. He said he wrote about the narrow Bow Bridge
For peds built in 1878 which is sad and fine
And always photographed through branches in the foregrine
Which was sufficiently sad to make him weep all the tine
He was trying to write the poem so he threw it away.
He tried again and he uncontrollably wept agine.
Did you try a third tine,
I asked. No, he said, and here's why:
Life is uncontrollably sad all the time
Unless we divert ourselves with art objects,
Sex, or tequila or beer, and if we tell the truth
About this, for instance when we feel it
While looking at a photograph of the cast ine
Bow Bridge or see in life not photos but the real bridge at a short destine
Away with the actual park and branches around us,
We feel like killing ourselves to stop the pain
Or as you, Arthur, call it, the pine,
So I didn't try a third time
To write the poem. Get off this line,
He said. Wait! Don't hang up, he said, I take it back, stay on the phine!

Well, I considered calling on my second longer distance line
Kenneth who in heavine has changed his name to Kenneth Kine
And Barbara who I did call on my second longer distance line
With Hart on hold and affirmed her name change to Barbara Gine
But I didn't ask those younger two about uncontrollable totally dominant sadness
Or whether they had discarded their own poems about the 36 cast ine
Bridges for people to walk on in Central Park
Because they were weeping on the paper and pine
Ing for Hart's Big Deep Salty Lake to ease the pine.
I didn't call Frank because I never knew hine I mean him.
I figured the next step was mine.
So if you can believe it I hung up on Hart Crine.





To His Mother, Whose Name Was Maria
 

Invoked every sundown, it's you, painted on clouds
rouging our treasured plain and all who walk it,
with leaf-fresh kids and women damp from traveling,
city-bound, in the radiance of a just-stopped shower;
it's you, mother eternally young, courtesy of death's
plucking hand, rose at the fragrant point of unpetaling,
you who are the alpha of every neurosis, every torturing anxiety,
and for this I give you gratitude for time past, time present, time future.






Nigella
 

She minces squid and a marinated scallion,
Mixes rice with shrimp and olive paste. . . .
Hope for the English meal, though half Italian
With her jet black hair and her elastic waist.

Unlike the other television cooks,
She brings to life a lobster that was dead
With common spices, her exotic looks,
And recipes she dreamed about in bed.






Heart Valve
 

They told me there'd be pain

so when I felt it, 
sitting at my beat-up farm desk

that looks out glass doors 

onto the browning garden--plain sparrows 
bathing in the cube-shaped fountain

so violently they drain it, 

the white-throats with their 
wobbly two-note song 

on the long way south still, 

and our dogs 
out like lights and almost 

falling off their chairs

freed of the real-time for awhile
as time began for me

to swell, slow down, carry me out 

of all this almost 
to a where

about as strong a lure as love.





In Hell the Units Are the Gallon and the Fuck
 

The unit of wine is the cup. Of Love, the unit is the kiss. That's here.
In Hell, the units are the gallon and the fuck. In Paradise, the drop and the glance.

Ants are my hero. They debate and obey. They can sit at a table for
Eight hours, drawing. They spot out the under-theorized . . .

Have some. For they are as abundant here as the flecks of mica in the Iowa night sky.
What are twenty-sided dishes of fancy almonds? What use jewels?

He is Klidsa. You are nothing. Or rather, you're a tray of stainless steel cones.
Meanwhile, one opens Kumrasambhava to rainbow-colored crystals pointing every which way.

Nice try. You're a tank-builder but you refuse to build tanks. And so now you are to be watched over 
By three heckling birds, evilly named, discomfiting to children.

Fijate! you're to be watched by three fowl, commonplace in Florida. Even these 
Three hearty objectionables: the blue tit, the woodpecker, and the swampcunt.

I'm one to talk. I'm so twisted up, my only hope is Salena. My physical therapist,
With the eyes of Athena, and the hands of a destroying eagle.






Dandelions
 


After the cling of roots and then the "pock
when they gave way
                                     the recoil up the hand
               was a small shock
of emptiness beginning to expand.

Milk frothing from the stems. Leaves inky green
and spiked.
                      Like blissed-out childhood play 
              turned mean 
they snarled in tangled curls on our driveway.

It happens still. That desolating falling
shudder inside
                            and then our neighborhood
                seems only sprawling
loops...like the patterns eaten on driftwood:

even the home where I grew up (its smell
of lingering
                      wood-smoke and bacon grease)
             seems just a shell
of lathe and paper. But this strange release

follows: this tinge like silver and I feel
the pull of dirt 
                            again, sense mist uncurling
               to reveal
no architecture hidden behind the world

except the stories that we make unfolding:
as if our sole real power 
                                                    were the power
             of children holding 
this flower that is a weed that is a flower.





Over Greenland
 

A current like a noise machine through sleep.
Blue lichen fields. Mossed boulders. Waking up
to ice cubes cracking in a plastic cup

and voices ("awesome for the Hong Kong branch
. . . well, most of all we miss our daughter . . . ) I still
see it: the climb up slate as runnels spill

from some bare misted summit like a source.
Whatever sense this dream might make
to others. And whatever when they wake

they also have been dreaming. Rivers of faces
down hallways, merging, as desires mesh
and fissure. Cash for clothes or arms or flesh.

And if there is no towering sublime
where all comes clear to all, no final climb
through cloud, like some old Bible illustration:

how could that ever stop the current flowing
out of the glass at jfk: skin glowing
plumb and peach as we walk inside the sun.





Testament
 

The cat wants to be a strong thing--a hand, a tree. 
The girl wants to be a pirate, in a tree. 
The tree wants to be the pond with its face of shining. 
The pond wants to be the sun who dumps its sugar on the grass. 
The grass wants to be the foot, its sole, its heel. 
The foot wants to be the brain who always gets to choose. 
The brain wants to be the feet dumb in their shoes.
The shoe wants to be the buckle that the girl shines with a cloth. 
The buckle wants to be the magpie lifting what shines. 
The magpie wants to be the egg in the nest touching its brother. 
The egg wants to be the feather. 
The feather wants to be the mite, devouring its plume.

It isn't the blood,          It isn't the bone.          It's never the matter that matters.          Particles, molecules, cells, fingers, eyes, nerves          Are only places for the system          Of meaningful vibrations.          It's all in the meaning, the movement,          The idea--that's the idea.          It's never the clones, the bones, the          Silicon chips, skinflick rips.          It's what you adopt,          And how you adapt.          They were all amazed          How a tinkerer like me          Could be such a shrewd investor.          I looked for the movement, the vibration,          Not the matter, the system!          And that's how I got rich!          It's not the hog bellies, hope chests,          Chest of gold, heads of state,          Skin, the belly, chest, head:          The matter is just a medium,          The system is the idea.                         miranda & evvy & nicholas[Then joined by Simon.]          The matter is mortal          But the system lives on          The matter is mulch          The matter is static          The matter is zilch--          But the system is movement, the ideal          Is real and the idea persists.                         simon          It made me rich!

When you're all a vibration          Without any one face          We could know you with?                         evvy          Will I know what is you          Without any breath?          Will it be your voice?          Or a simulation?                         miranda & evvy          What will I know,          What will I do,          How will my ears          Know what they hear?          How will my hands          Know what they touch?          How will it be you,          And how will I know?                         simon          What does it matter?          Simulation, place,          Medium, voice,          Face, shmace--          As many as I want,          Faces and voices.          Now I am almost purely,          Entirely,          Into the system          I'm nearly          Out of matter.          But maybe I'm not          Out of time.                         evvy          But how can you be yourself,          Without a body?          How will I know you, my husband,          How will you know me?                         simon          Maybe as a bird, maybe          As a dog, a horse, a house:          "Body my house          my horse my hound          what will I do          when you are fallen          Where will I sleep          How will I ride          What will I hunt . . .           when Body my good           bright dog is dead.          So said the immortal May Swenson--          I'll be more immortal than her and that peculiar bird          The immortal William Yeats. [Nods to Nicholas.]           Now!          See you later![Nicholas turns a switch or two, hits the return key, etc., and Simon slumps forward. The room shakes a bit. The metal bird stirs, stretches its wings, squawks a little. The portrait of young Simon becomes animated, looks around the room.]                         evvy          What now?

Scene Two
[Miranda and Nicholas are in the room, which continues to stir mysteriously, an animated environment. The portrait, the bird, other objects, pulse or shift like sleeping animals.]                           simon [Muttering, half-whispered.]           Remember.

*     *     * Scene Three
                         miranda          He has been silent all last night          And all day.          These things are alive, this place--          But is my father alive? Is he here?          Can he speak?          When can we hear his voice?                          nicholas          Where is Evvy?                          miranda          Finally asleep. She's afraid          That he's lost forever.          Can you help us hear him?                          nicholas          Yes!--He helped me, now I'll help him.          They said I was a vegetable          Or a piece of meat.          He gave me a new body,          Made of graphite and magnesium,          Titanium alloy and copper--          Better than meat!          When I was a kid          And he had           More money than God,          He came into the ward          And saved me at random.          Now, I'll help him live in the System.          The way he helped me:          I'll help him live without a body--          Post-Organic, like me!                         nicholas [Nicholas's "Song To His Arms; holds up his right arm.]           One arm of bone and gristle, nerves and muscle--          Mortal, fallible, breakable.          Saved by the idea, saved by the System. [Holds up his left arm, a mechanized prosthesis, an openwork of rods and cables.]           One arm of magnesium and nickel,           Graphite, silicon, and cable--          Mortal, fallible, breakable.           Perfection of the soul-ware          Capable of renewal          Never in the matter.                          miranda          This room          Is all of him?                          nicholas          Not the room, or the arm,          Always the system,           All in the principle          That moves the cable and moves the muscle.                          miranda          Can we hear his voice?          Is he only this place?                         nicholas          Like my left arm, that is mine          Not me,          Like a tool or a baby's rattle.          So is his voice, so is this place.          And the right arm, too, is mine          Not me.          Like my skull lined with gristle          So too his voice, so too this place.          Even the brain in its shell,          As mortal, as fallible, as breakable.          As the clone the bone the hardest stone          All mortal and material--          I can help him, in the real.          Not in silicon, titanium, or nickel          Not hammered and enameled--          Immaterial and immortal!          Chrome and nickel, silicon and graphite.          All get tired and old.          Only the form is real.          Only the system can hold.          Now we can hear his voice:          What is your name? [The artist's version of young Simon steps hesitantly from the portrait. His movements are subtly but distinctly unnatural, even mechanical. He moves somewhat as the robots did as they began taking on their roles.]                          simon          What is my name?          A name is a machine.          A name is a made-up thing          That proposes someone is real.          My name is          A machine for designation--          That's what any name is.          My name is Simon Walter Powers,          It proposes I am alive.          Like my spiritual mentors          The immortal Walter Disney          And the immortal Walter Whitman,          My fellow Walters          And fellow-inventors.          And by the way,          I have billions of bucks,          And I can still sign checks.           That's what!                          miranda          The gestures are unreal          And so is the face          But this is how he talks          And this is his voice.                         nicholas          Who is the president of the United States? [The young Simon has receded back into the portrait. Simon's voice now emerges from the bird.]                          simon          A man who wants my favor,          A man who courts my power,          A guy who wants to meet my movie stars,          And wants to use my billions.          That's who.                         miranda          Daddy, is it you in there?          And can you hear me?                         nicholas          In a moment we will try          To see if he can hear you.          What is your business? [The bird becomes relatively still, the next lines are in Simon's voice coming from the portrait again, or from some other part of the room.]                          simon [As portrait or--]           I am a producer.          And business is my wares.          Lady's Wear, Software,          Hardware--Artware,          Warware, Peaceware--          I am in Every Ware:          Or you might call it Being Ware--          Some call it fantasy          Some call it entertainment          Some are wary of its power.          The Consuming Power of Billions.          My business is making Being:          To build the towers, to cure          The disease, to make the hours          Amusing or improving          By showing you something new          By taking you some where real          You never were before.          My business is the Mind.          My business is to make it free          To be everywhere          My wares are every ware          You can imagine.          That's what.          And I have billions of bucks.          And I can still sign checks.                          nicholas          It works! He is alive,          But he is not matter.                          miranda          And is he still Simon,          Is he still my father?                          nicholas          All of that,          And something better!
*     *     *Scene Four
[The middle of the night. Evvy enters in a daze, nearly as if sleepwalking. Evvy speaks with the disembodied Simon.]                          evvy          Simon, do you remember the first time we danced?                         simon          In the parking lot near the Francis Drake Hotel.                          evvy          They had the windows open and we could hear the band.                          simon          "Begin the Beguine. I remember the terrace.                         evvy          On the other side remember of the tall hedge.                         simon          A tall hedge of pittosporum. I remember.                         evvy          And the smell I remember of night jasmine.                         simon          Your dress pink your pearls in as I remember two strands.                         evvy          Held together I remember by a little silver bangle.                         simon          I remember, love. And we danced for joy. Remember?                         evvy          It's hard to get used to seeing you like this. Do you want to live forever?                         simon          People say "forever, they say,          "Do you want to live forever!          And people say, "enough:          "Haven't you had enough?          Wrong questions!          It's not forever! It's not "enough!          It's . . . more!          Don't talk about enough!          Enough never is enough!          It's more!          Ask anybody how much money          Would be enough for you?          Just about everybody          Says double what they have          Or double what they make:          More!          What's enough being alive?          Why does the crushed bug          Keep waving a leg? That wave          Is for more, more, and more.          Forever doesn't matter.          Enough isn't good enough.          What matters is more.          And if you think you've got          Three score years and ten          Then what you want is not          To outlive the sun,          But a hundred and forty--more!          Forever is not the point.          All that matters is more.          Don't talk about enough,          There's no such thing--          What you want is more:          More, more, more.                         evvy          Touch me.          O yes that.

Scene Five
[Nicholas alone. He now has two prosthetic arms and a prosthetic leg, but glides about efficiently, as though he has become part-Segway. He is fiddling with the now more-elaborate bird and portrait, which seem more alive than ever, as does the entire room. Robots are bustling about to assist him. Miranda enters, apparently accustomed to this new, stranger atmosphere.]                          miranda          They are here--          The important delegation          From the United Way,          The Administration          And the United Nations--          They want to speak to him, they say          They want his ear.          They say it's regarding          Matters of the whole          Planet's life and death.                         nicholas          They want his ear?          Don't they understand?          He doesn't hear with ears,          He doesn't speak with breath. [Nicholas gleefully sheds another part of his human-looking body. Robots are dancing (vocalizing).]           He says they should speak with Evvy,          She handles that kind of thing.                         miranda          The whole planet--famine, war,          The exploitation of children . . .          The whole planet . . .          They know Evvy isn't the same.          They know she doesn't listen          To anything but him.          I myself don't know          If she hears him or not.          Here she comes.          Evvy, dear--          Did you speak with the delegation? [Evvy enters wearing headphones, swaying a little as if to music, nodding and tilting her head as if in conversation. She appears not to hear Miranda.]                          evvy          Mmmm.                         nicholas          Evvy, can you hear Simon?                         evvy          Mmmmmm.                         miranda          Are you listening to him?

Simon, Daddy--are you there?          Are you speaking to her?          Will you see the delegation          From the United Way,          The Administration          And the United Nations?

Will you listen?                         nicholas          They want his ear,          They want his eye--          Those parts are dead and buried!          He's rather cranky          And weary today.          Send the delegation on its way.          Send them away.          miranda          I can't send away          A delegation from the world--          The Outside World Itself.          The children . . . the devastation . . .

I will see it and hear it          For two minutes.

"Group of Young Men Beats Nurse to Death "A group of young men taking part in coming-of-age rituals due to include circumcision turned on their male nurse and killed him, an official said yesterday. A spokesman for the provincial Health Department said the young men, ages 18 to 25, beat the man to death with sticks at the site of their initiation ceremonies in Port Angel on Friday evening. The attack followed complaints by the men that they were not being properly looked after during their initiation ceremonies. The nurse was in charge of caring for the men ahead of their circumcision.

[Miranda, Evvy, the now semi-robotic Nicholas, whose head may be on a shelf or cranny of the Segway-like body.]                          nicholas          Still, I do wonder--          Now that we are ready          To leave the last bit          Of these mortal bodies,          I do wonder          Why does he choose          More and more          To live away from the world.          The senses will be stronger,          Not weaker.          The body will do more,          Not less.          The mind will be free.          The senses will be pure,          More and more.                         miranda          What will it feel like?          What does he feel?                         evvy [She removes the headphones, and regains focus.]           I will tell you what it is like.          I have been listening to Simon.          It's like when we fell in love.          This is what it is like:          When you stand on a high building          Or on a bridge and you want to jump off          Something in you wants to jump off,          To feel what it might be like to fall.          You can jump. You can fall.          You can fall forever, and do it again.          You are free to keep on falling forever          You are free to fall and change your mind          And drift back up.          I've been listening to Simon.          Excuse me.                         nicholas          She is going into the system.          The world is her body,          She is everything she hears,          She can see for a million miles.          It is like falling in love. [Evvy is transformed, her body becomes empty and she is manifested somewhere in the room. Another portrait? The bird in another form?]                          evvy[As part of the room.]          Are you coming, Nicholas?                         nicholas          I'm already there! [Nicholas too is transformed, appearing as some previously inanimate part of the room. It appears that everyone in the family unit except Miranda has "become the room.]                          miranda          They have all gone into the world of light!          But what about the poor, the children, the starving? [The United Way, The United Nations, and The Administration lead onstage a parade of the world's miseries--the victims of famine, torture, crime, disease.The pageant subsides into the shadows, with Miranda alone in the foreground, with the room dim and inert.]           And, what about me?          With nothing like a mother          Of flesh and blood, nothing          Like a father,           Either alive or dead.           Can all the earth be disembodied?           Neither alive nor dead?          Can we all fall and rise forever?          Together?          Are we few rising into the light,           While the others sink down into pain?          Can we help them up          When we are free of meat?          I want my mother! [The figure of Simon, in his human body, on a wheelchair or semi-gurney, with respirator and iv drip, emerges from the shadows. Not quite real, like a hologram.]                          miranda          Father! Is it you? Still in a body?          Still in this world of meat?                         simon          I appear to you one more time,          Dear Miranda, to explain:          Like you, I tried to help the world.          I, too, saw these miseries, and I've          Tried to heal the world, too.          But the animal is defective.          It's not the poor or the starving          That hold you back. It's yourself--I know:          I, too, tried to heal the world--          But it's in us, the problem's in us, it's in us.          We evolved as meat, to love fat and sugar;          Once that was good, but now it is fatal.          We evolved as flesh, to want sex all the time;          Once that was good, but now it's only trouble.          We evolved as muscle, to want to make war;          Once that was good, but now that is lethal.          Our fat and sugar are killing us,          Our sweetness and abundance          Kill us, and lead us to famine          Bigger McMuck, Thicker Sweet Shake.

Meat wants Meat, Meat wants Sweet,          Meat sweats for the Sweets,          Meat wants who it meets--          It kills to eat.          Now there's no help but evolving          Out of the meat, and into the system.          It isn't the many and the few--          It's yourself, it's you!          Come! Into the world of light!                         miranda          The misery's part of our being,          We don't need to amputate it.          And me, my own misery is part of me.          I don't want to amputate it          Painful as it is.          Yes, what about me?          With nothing like another          Person's body          To touch, no body to feel,           I can still feel the misery          Of what I lack.          No body to have or be had by,          No way to make love.          No lover, no other.          Nothing of the body.          With nothing like a mother          Of flesh and blood, nothing          Like a father,          Either alive or dead.          Can all the earth be disembodied?          Neither alive nor dead?          Can we all fall and rise forever?          Together?          Are we few rising into the light,          While the others sink down into pain?          Can we help them up          When we're free of meat?          Who will we touch?          I want my sugar, my touch,          I want my sweet milk          My meat and my misery          My touch and my milk--          I want my mother!                         simon          What you feel is phantom pain          In the amputated limb.

And "starvation--          An absence of fuel          In an inferior body?          A defective shell?          Are they both a coming to rest?          And why would one choose the worst?

[sack for PICTS]
 

i make signs everywhere, with sticks, stones and leaves
              for those in the clouds from below the line to arrive

i don't have a language to speak to you with, my tongues are all fish

i know that a one is a circle, and that nothing is round,
              except every corner i saw by the hearts
              lined up on the spine

i know that the winter will finally be here again, and that the summer
               will die and be born with its ice

i unravel the token you gave me for freedom, i bury the flags in your eyes
              under each Arabic sign. . . 1,2,3, on and on. . . and before

i varnish again all the battle grounds freed          to travel the face of 2 yews

i remake every button with children put down by 5 tons of your crosses

i am flaking with crust at the dangling ushers        they fall for light signs

i make my car shake with my fear, the headlights are showing me songs
               by the road for the now disappeared, shots crack by the ones that 
                                                                     remain

i can tell by your lies and your pride that your heart is as small as your pupils
               opening up for your strokes
               and getting smaller for light

i am the siphon that gravity fills up the blanks in your face with

i sing a throat full of gritos, for the safety releases that shots spill for you

i salivate for your spiraling warmth, in the morning when i collapse, over and over

i have all our love letters taped to the ceiling, my sleep is the end of our flies
               their warbles keep rolling

i double the maps on your roads

i put a slab of meat on your cheeks

i thaw every word that pours ends through your blood

i turn in the hair that your father hung with, erasers ring mountains for more

i pick up a chair for the lightning, satellites put out a bead

i bleed in the real that you see with a shine, pieces of chicken pile up to count nukes

i tear off the rain, and cut its numerical age into passing truck tombs

i force your faces to mine, and bother your ebony whirls to circle the holes in the sky

i fire electrons to make your promise discard its word, and fall through

i tie miseries to drains, and pay off my debt with suns

i am more cruel than a counter

i pick a safe with your words, until my distance is short

i slap at your monthly returns, and tie your animals to 5 dirt seas

i ride through your roads in the glass, and steal tiny cracks

i blame the small stone       hid       in my colorless mouth, and pin rags to your lips

i volunteer for your wars, and lose them all

i borrow your daydreams, and purse up their gardens, into our hands

i pulse with you standing by rocks

i say all you said by the iron door

i throw kites in the room where they found me

i sell off inseparable fingers

i throw windows to walls

i whispers hard rings into telephones, and scratch at the bed

i fade into water

i remember the hands

i open holes through barbed houses

i blow darts through your tunnels and doors

i pile roofs through our wounds

i move through your runs and your screens

i see the news in the sand

i digit up noontimes

i peel off my skins with old sounds

i walk through the valley of lead

i unplug your pages of light

i frost over programs and ride            3 roads on 5 deer






[4,2]
 

i fail in the retry of possible gaps
               for the middle of canyons
               in crumbling lights
               for the scarification of vinyl.
               it rides through the forest
               and throbs a small packet
               where parallel seams
               scratch a readable surface
               on the backs of the camels
               in mirages of separate planes
               to the bursting eclipse
               of pronounceable service,
               two spots on its forehead call out
               for the country of doubling masses
               on a highway that cuts into faces
               in line for the city
               every stream ties a knot
               for an opening under the sea

i lose all my digits 
               to the moon that will one day be bare
               to the parched piles of breathing in farms
               to the doorways that promise a morning
               on the accident prone to a murder of chance
               every mouse in the dust in the kitchen
               will harvest the cold
               in the sickness of scattering twigs
               in the answer of mirrors
               for the double that sings with the night
               by the prayer full of ashes
               under frozen cadavers that once
               were the hearts
               in the egg of a wound

i disappear in the wrap-up
               for invisible letters that leave all the snow
               for the hunt to deliver migration
               on the mushroom fields full of returns
               under beaches in roads by a promise
               where the water turns into a home
               and the blame of the air will no longer wail
               for the spot in the cloud full of planets
               while a bubble reenters a womb
               for explosions in placards
               like the front of a bus
               crossing vines in a prairie
               that were traced on the skin of a goat

i look at the picture of too many races
               for the blood of a horse
               that a bundle of sleeping
               3 shorted connections
               for the change of electrical chairs
               under pools of announcements
               for the battling showers
               that tell all the stories of war
               to infants in sight of the corner of trading
               for the telephones buried in answers
               under barrooms and sawdust and piers
               where the songs of an isthmus
               circle the beacon
               where the moon cannot pull
               where a whisper
               moves sand off a stone

i weigh every mote in my eye with the fingers of handshakes
               they calibrate walks like the wheels of a car
               they reflect in a wave
               like untying the knot of a bruise full of ice
               where once was a number
               where the count was eleven
               where equality lifts
               like the dough
               that incarcerates mud clots and showers
               for the vanishing thorn
               in a guide by the pillow
               softly omitted
               what the second hand sees
               under gears by the hand of a cripple
               for the ditch in a face that is fine

i bury my head in the leaves
               that the buses were lost in
               that day when i looked for her here in the Arctic
               when the telephone poles were the marks of equators
               when the mornings at home
               could not write their own name
               when the shepherd was singing too many shields
               at the entrance of staring at stars in the basement
               with the light in the chest of what follows
               with a walking that pulls at two seals
               for the trouble in words
               in the empty
               in the on and off one
               why there have to be zeros
               to raise all the shores
               for piatas to line themselves up in the snow
               under spreading the phase
               of recalling the crosshairs
               on the hive
               that the singing will never return
               when the breaking gives others
               a prompt to give air

i radio frequencies meant to undress all the parrots
               in the knot that a hill on the head
               of the viewer can see
               without even a monkey to grow
               with a molecule's power
               in a black hole instead of a screen
               in identity swimming to surface
               every outlook reframes on a break
               in circular lots
               by the parking spot full of directions
               where a jacket sinks into the roll
               of an orange in Fez
               around trains in the mountains
               that the pantomime echoes
               in the valley of shells that call out
               for an engine to answer
               when penalties cease in the skull
               of another score gone on the pavement
               with the sound of a bell that is broken
               to bear its first weight in the sand





[live chat]
 

are you
on the other side
waiting 
for alarms 
in a desert 
of sleepless 
evaporations?

are you
beside yourself 
in the aisles
that distance
makes shorter

than light waves 
in the daylight
that pounds
a lead slab
in the soup
that the winter
dissolves?

are you 
the signal
that another plane
carves into wings
in rounded contusions
of a late afternoon
storm,
full of sparks
that the night hurries out
on Locust and serial
cheeks 
shrouded
in shiny costumes?

are you
a circle
like juntas
that the winter makes clear
on the shaved orbiting molecule
that the ear revolves
around,
in a retreat
of explosive 
fossils?

are you 
memorizing
the connections
between the hand
and the foot
and the torso
in reverse
of the automatic?

are you 
materializing
the unknown
without weather
to increase
the planet
otherwise?

are you
pocketing
the insurance claims
that parkas
and snow equips
with sutures
and hand grenades?

forever?

are you 
increasing
the tackle box
full of piers
to widen the sea
and shorten 
circuits
full of trees?

are you
feeding the unworn
through a parallel
shapelessness
in desert blooms
on the roots
of a tarp
milking masks?

are you 
remodeling
the world
as a breathing
action doll?

are you 
calm for knots 
like the guardian hell
that a sewer makes
for angels
in their last testimony
skewered 
like the pony 
was?

are you 
freezing in the open
course that half
of everything
enumerates
like clouds?

are you 
unwound in a fear
that a jacket
stores
for feed, in easy
shows
and rented
faces on the pain
of entry?

are you
good
like ovens?






[even when issues arise . . .]
 

even when issues arise and obedience can not be secured by the bludgeon, the bludgeon remains; when we mention the people, we do not mean the confessional body of the people, we mean particularly itinerant bodies in mechanic flux, preaching freedom beyond flesh pamphlets of authority, concealed in blind devotion. when we mean the people, we mean a people knowing their own strength cast as day laborers, or knowing to a greater part of a lesser known part playing paid intercourse in all connections for the people by the people. when we mean, we mean broke or abrasive worn, once open scream representatives, now incarcerated in a rationalistic shadow land, given a history that merges extruder merchandising with wholesale lots of intermittent dung, or objects for understudy beatings.






[the day shifts . . .]
 

the day shifts, we talk to each other the way we talk to each other, the luster fades, our bodies fill with sap, there is a shift, joy reappears before another personal narrative burns to a heap of citations, continuing in complicated machinery, becoming blood knots in space, both the living and dead surround the present has been. I open my eyes in the full force of fear and hesitation, frozen in passing passageways with endless permutations, subjected to violence, stupidity, and love.






[can I do this spiritual drag . . .]
 

   can I do this spiritual drag, collective agony wishful thinking, fearful peek-a-boo actuality about to be read in unapologetic disinterested participation against fantasy without benefit familiarity, remembering distortion, forgetting drudgery necessary to consume anything cement sorrow, surrounded by transfer credit surcharge immortal siege ideology, submissive to appliance bodyisms in doubt in the face of stupidity--oops--knowledge, derivative of skin, bones, eyes and the rest, opposite abrupt aggressive remoteness here to serve another ascendant say-so? I tremble in doubt, divided by multiple entry points and explosive content wrapped in rambling overlays sent to the council on commentary, and without exception the animation either frenetic or dull, shifts to no options left, recognizing useless hope in the face of bomb holes caused by numbering digits.







[ready to receive remains . . .]
 

  ready to receive remains built for death, ready to receive the flatly desolate superficial deeply commissioned intellectual offer of suggestive actions, for the hunger assassin to fall back on and become forcefull psychological damage, bottled for drinkable agitation. 

   riding a back seat writing construction, contesting the oncoming molten universe, immersed in villagers, city dwellers, trembling, laughing, (white teeth redone for the perfect test of time), to inhale flesh and stone from long ago, forgetting the horrors of holy oil infusion clocks and gritty body galleries, leaving behind the mourning river's crimson fragrance smoldering from the previous unbearable fever. 

   in a posture of myself on a speeding body, without hands and feet, I am ready to receive the vomit of consciousness and proceed down the avenues of suggestion to become a limited option.





[there is a shipwreck . . .]
 

   there is a shipwreck on each side of innuendo, tears gather around the collective shadow of shadows; none clearer than the last unshakable, anatomically inexplicably, never noticed, next time, please sir, more.
 
  enshrouded by fear, one hundred years after eleven pages of violent reality testing, when the beginning was the final question, outside the disruption of anything hungry on emptiness, suggesting a response of objections, calling on me to speak in tongues.
 
   trying to read the consequential future, apply anything to anything; knowing any application to the current materiality is wretched normality and remote productivity.





[in the general conservative cast . . .]
 

   in the general conservative cast, overcome by lack of suicidal tendencies, in the worried beyond reason shaking dense under-growth invasion of deliberately callous vertebrates, hotheaded newagers paint possible minds dirtier than can be produced in a real whereabouts nonlocation location, crumbling in darkness.   a breath away from my next instant self, knowing lies will flow from my lips as well as the rest; a creative fallacy to create that which we think we know, with a thousand pens ready to suggest what one should do.   reminding myself, all ends with what effects it will have.   reminding myself, all ends with what can be named and financed, so why not let my bones be picked by the ants.   reminding myself, I would do anything to not remember who I resemble, I would do anything to not resemble who I resemble, to not resemble the resembled.   reminding myself, I would do anything to not belong to a future human potential workshop, supported by a cast of thousands begging for all things mundane sanity brings, in general overcome by lack of suicidal tendencies.





[everyones dying . . .]
 

everyone's dying
everyone's dying to die
everyone's in my way
on my way to die
it's too hot and dusty to die
I am eating the ashes of the dead
eating the exhaust of cars
an image sacrifice
looking for a boat to heaven
namaste,
your boat has bad karma
out of the way
I am burning inside of shame
I am at the seat of ash
on a boat to nowhere
burning inside
I am the end of time
shiva orange
rat queen
goddess of money
sleeping in time to die at the hands of doms
sunrise to sunrise from the beiginning of time
alone at the end of time
rowing nowhere
lost in serpentine alleys
amongst the amputees and water buffalos
amongst dust breathing souls
looking into eyes
looking back
for anything
not burning

Tuning
 

Herr Stimmung--purblind--moves in corporeal time.
  
     Think how many, by now, have escaped the world's memory.
  
     Think, how all his wandering is only thought. Having once tried to
 live in the quasi-stupor of sensation, now he picks his way through
 areas of spilth, seeking the least among infinite evils.
  
     His hope: intermittent.
  
     To a person so little conscious, what would it mean to die? Though
 he feels, true enough, death's wither-clench. Thinking always of
 something permanent, watching the while how everything goes on
 changing.
  
     He has seen where Speed is buried. Eyes exorbitant.
  
     He has the tension of male and female: active, divided. Anger and
 lust. What he eats tastes exactly like real food.
  
     He would search out interphenomena, if he could decipher the
 interstices. The broken line. Immediate havoc. Circular heaven.
 Square earth. He cries world world, and there is no world.
  
     He claims superiority over the other animals, being the only one
 who can talk, the only one to have doubts.
  
     Herr Stimmung knows a whale is big. Its skeleton might shelter a
 dozen men.
  
     Not existing, not subsisting--insisting. Not object, not subject--
 eject. (He works within opposed systems, every one of them opposed
 to system.)
  
     "Fillette--in confusion he addresses himself--"n'allez pas au bois
 seulette.
  
     He knows who is allowed to wear what kinds of beads. He knows
 how fruit trees are inherited. All his self-objects lie in the inoperative
 past.
  
     Herr Stimmung springs from a long undocumented ancestry.
  
     He has a special attitude towards terror.





Herr Stimmung on Transparency
 

To those of a certain temperament, there is nothing worse than the 
thought of something hidden, secret, withheld from their knowing--
especially if they suspect that another knows about it and has even,
perhaps, connived at keeping it concealed.

    D. H. Lawrence seems to have been irritated no end by the thought
that people were having sex and not telling him.

    Freud too.

   --Ah but then Freud arranged it so that everyone had to tell.

    His psychoanalysis lights up the depths, makes our tangled web
transparent, to the point where I can see all the way down to It. 

    And the process moves outward in increasing rings:

    The Master analyses his disciples. Who thereby--transparent
now--become masters and, in turn, take on others, patients or
disciples, to analyse.

    So that eventually there are no secrets.

    Except, of course, those of the first Master, the Self-Analysed.

    Which is to say, the only private One, sole Unrevealed. Opaque
center of His universal panopticon.

    While we see only His words, His daughter, His cigar.

    Poor Lawrence.

from Hyperglossia [She wakes up. . .]
 

She wakes up in the afterlife in a fog. Unaware that she had an enemy, she was unprepared when the villain approached to deliver a fatal head injury. Part of her soul is stuck in her tomb, but as is common, it has a fake door where intercourse can occur, while another part of her soul begins a new adventure in form and in name. Always a reticent young woman, in premature death her speech-producing anatomy becomes irrepressible as she tries to render her circumstance comprehensible.

Slide
 

You and I inhabit thresholds, clinging to neither here nor there, and to
 and: this is a threshold of no relief, of interrogative light and obviated
 shadows, of questions flattened between clapboard slides,
 in laboratories of hanging frames--in a potential frame,
 the next moment slumps beneath the shadow of the overhang.
  
 They call it earthquake weather, a day like this, of reflected light
 and leveling heat of no relief, of corners around which
 and angles of incidence jellied in consomm,
 molded in amber lunches of tea and
 impossible: no incidents or tension, no reflection.
  
 No striations: rather, bangle, a broken shoelace
 and what are we going to do about that hair?
  
 We were in a boat. You were navigating and I was tending
 the lines, which flew from my hands, flapping like live wires
 on the wind. You watched the shadow of our sail on the water
 through the light reflected in your face, conducted a depth sounding:
  
 You went under, but not overboard, swam away to plot reliefs
 of ocean floors. It is far too shallow here to die.

The Secret Panel
 

Not unusual, to have therapy only one night a week,
 to have a professional to talk to about personal problems.
 Evening would be a typical time, after work. It might
 require traveling there by public transportation, in a city
 where few people have cars, and taxis have become
 expensive in the past few years. Some movies have a scene
 where a character in the movie is tapping on a wall, along
 a bookshelf, then suddenly, the wall slides aside. Therapists
 can let their clients in by buzzing a button, if they're in a 
 private office they don't share with any colleagues. The wall
 may have ornamental architectural devices trimming it,
 but those stay in place when it moves and slides aside.
 If one client arrives before the previous session is finished,
 he or she has to wait in a waiting area. He can put his hands
 on his lap, palms down on his thighs. Upon first seeing it,
 you don't realize that there is another room, a corridor,
 hidden behind the wall. They must suspect that there is
 a secret panel, because there they are tapping on the wall.
 They hold an ear near the wall and tap it with two fingers.
 The later client may see the previous client leaving, therapist
 shaking his or her hand goodbye, "Until next week, and
 the client could develop feelings about this weekly exchange,
 might feel jealousy. The actors in the movie could then go inside
 the hidden room or secret corridor behind the sliding panel
 and escape from some deadly danger that has been threatening.

In a U-Haul North of Damascus
 

1 

Lord, what are the sins 
I have tried to leave behind me? The bad checks, 
the workless days, the scotch bottles thrown across the fence   
and into the woods, the cruelty of silence, 
the cruelty of lies, the jealousy, 
the indifference? 

What are these on the scale of sin   
or failure 
that they should follow me through the streets of Columbus,   
the moon-streaked fields between Benevolence 
and Cuthbert where dwarfed cotton sparkles like pearls 
on the shoulders of the road. What are these 
that they should find me half-lost,   
sick and sleepless 
behind the wheel of this U-Haul truck parked in a field 
            on Georgia 45 
a few miles north of Damascus, 
some makeshift rest stop for eighteen wheelers 
where the long white arms of oaks slap across trailers 
and headlights glare all night through a wall of pines? 


2 

What was I thinking, Lord? 
That for once I'd be in the driver's seat, a firm grip   
on direction? 

So the jon boat muscled up the ramp, 
the Johnson outboard, the bent frame of the wrecked Harley   
chained for so long to the back fence,   
the scarred desk, the bookcases and books,   
the mattress and box springs, 
a broken turntable, a Pioneer amp, a pair 
of three-way speakers, everything mine 
I intended to keep. Everything else abandon. 

But on the road from one state 
to another, what is left behind nags back through the distance,   
a last word rising to a scream, a salad bowl 
shattering against a kitchen cabinet, china barbs 
spiking my heel, blood trailed across the cream linoleum   
like the bedsheet that morning long ago 
just before I watched the future miscarried. 

Jesus, could the irony be 
that suffering forms a stronger bond than love? 


3 

Now the sun 
streaks the windshield with yellow and orange, heavy beads   
of light drawing highways in the dew-cover. 
I roll down the window and breathe the pine-air, 
the after-scent of rain, and the far-off smell 
of asphalt and diesel fumes. 

But mostly pine and rain 
as though the world really could be clean again. 

Somewhere behind me, 
miles behind me on a two-lane that streaks across   
west Georgia, light is falling 
through the windows of my half-empty house. 
Lord, why am I thinking about this? And why should I care   
so long after everything has fallen 
to pain that the woman sleeping there should be sleeping alone?   
Could I be just another sinner who needs to be blinded   
before he can see? Lord, is it possible to fall   
toward grace? Could I be moved 
to believe in new beginnings? Could I be moved?

J. Beer 1969-1969
 

It was when they determined that I had been born dead
 That my life became easier to understand. For a long time,
 I wondered why rooms felt colder when I entered them,
 Why nothing I said seemed to stick in anyone's ear,
 Frankly, why I never had any money. I wondered
 Why the cities I walked through drifted into cloud
 Even as I admired their architecture, as I pointed out
 The cornerstones marked "1820, "1950. The only songs
 I ever loved were filled with scratch, dispatches from 
 A time when dead ones like me were a dime a dozen.
 I spent my life in hotels: some looked like mansions,
 Some more like trailer parks, or pathways toward
 A future I tried to point to, but how could I point,
 With nothing but a hand no hand ever matched,
 With fingers that melted into words that no one read.
  
 I rehearsed names that others taught me: Caravaggio,
 Robert Brandom, Judith, Amber, Emmanuelle Cat.            
 I got hungry the way only the dead get hungry,
 The hunger that launches a thousand dirty wars,
 But I never took part in the wars, because no one lets
 A dead man into their covert discussions.
 So I drifted from loft to cellar, ageless like a ghost,
 And America became my compass, and Europe became 
 The way that dead folks talk, in short, who cares,
 There's nothing to say because nobody listens,
 There's no radio for the dead and the pillows seem
 Like sand. Let me explain: when you're alive,
 As I understand it, pillows cushion the head, the way
 A lover might soothe the heart. The way it works for me,
 In contrast, is everything is sand. Beds are sand,
 The women I profess to love are sand, the sound of music
 In the darkest night is sand, and whatever I have to say
 Is sand. This is not, for example, a political poem,
 Because the dead have no politics. They might have
 A hunger, but nothing you've ever known
 Could begin to assuage it.

I. THE FUNERAL MARCH (CHICAGO AND ORLEANS)

Once more in the city I cannot name,
 the boat city, the city of light,
 the city that endures its fall,
 the city of pleasures and vicissitudes,
 the skier's city, Fun City, the city under the sky,
 city of crime and vegetables, Pornograph City,
 the city governed by the Lost and Found Department,
 cabinet city, city of the bends, the opium city,
 Swing City, Archetype City, city of dust,
 city that eludes the seven ages, muskrat city,
 the island city of daughters and wives,
 Sin City, city of sincerity, the cavernous city,
 the city of conventions, hatmaker city,
 Alphabet City, city of the last and first,
 the city called Marrakesh (I know it is not Marrkesh),
 industrial city, the city of airplane booze,
 center city, the city without shoulders, the city that forgot,
 the trampoline city, Abacus City, the city of tears,
 the real city (or the city of the desert),
 the unreal city (or the city of good will),
 the city of rust, of showers, of late blooming aster,
 Hygiene City, the city of logistics--
 once more in the city called Halloween
 (I know it is not Halloween), I gathered
 the five true ingredients of gunpowder
 and arranged to meet my younger brother Stetson
 next noon at the Heartland Cafe. 

 Why do you walk with your face turned from me?
 All you do is complain and complain.
 What is this thing called love? It is nothing
 reliable, not like this silk cravat
 on which tiny turtles hover
 suspended against an amber background.
 The knot needs to be loosened. Night has come.
 I walk in the garden amid the late-blooming roses 
 and guard my glass from the moon.
 This morning the police came for me.
 They brought a letter covered with signs
 I could not decipher. They demanded 
 I register my address properly,
 because they are sorely tested by the time's demands
 and cannot function as my delivery service.
 I met their angry gazes with a sigh, and I proclaimed:
 "April is the coolest month, which brings
 happy policeman the pleasant dreams of spring.
 They still refused to answer my questions.
 I know my life is in terrible danger.
 What is this thing called love?


                          II. DON'T LOOK BACK
  
 A degree or two to the right
 of an imagined meridian
 marking time's monotonous ecliptic
 tracing and retracing the animal steps
 that bring the man down narrow hallways,
 a painting hangs, depicting
 an almond tree in blossom, unfurling
 white petals against a deepening green,
 brown brushstrokes scarring the field,
 and in the center of the decentered vista,
 a fleck of canvas erupts through the paint,
 as when air thrusts itself to fill a vacuum, 
 or after galactic gyrations the light
 of a now-cold star reveals itself to us
 and breaks the settled pattern of the sky.
 For if the tree implies a quiet place
 where pendulums might rest,
 the heart decline to beat, a place
 of time disclosing the lattice of time,
 each node identical, complete within itself,
 its infinite simplicity sufficient
 to lure the mind out of its droning dream
 of traffic, footstools, marzipan, and clouds
 back to itself, if the tree must be a sign
 of the viewer's hunger to escape from signs
 and thereby lose the world, the tiny scar
 unmakes the fiction that sustains the tree,
 the way a cashier's knowing jibe
 at the record you had waited weeks to buy,
 recommended to you by a woman you barely know
 who mentioned it in passing, then returned 
 to her diatribe against the host who failed
 to invite her boyfriend or her companion's boyfriend--
 you had only half been listening until she said,
 "It sounds like nothing else, not like the wind
 or ocean, not even like the early Pixies,
 though it has that effect on you, something like
 getting a letter addressed to someone else
that ends up addressed to you, in that
 reading it with a proper sense of shame
 throws your devotion to formalities
 completely out the window. I think they're from New York,
 and meant to ask her how the band was spelled,
 but the moment had passed, your cigarettes were out,
 and the birdless night grew colder. You returned
 to people you felt more familiar with,
 the oddly Teutonic name in the back of your mind,
 and only later came across it in the discount bin
 of the Princeton Record Exchange, whose clerks
 everyone knows are assholes, so the sneer
 on the Tom Verlaine guy's lips was no surprise,
 though it gripped you with a sense as far from panic
 as it resembled exile. No song can bear
 the weight we need to place upon it;
 nothing returns as we ask it to return.
  
 O O that T.S. Eliot
 he's such a shrinking violet
 and if you think I sigh a lot
 try life with T.S. Eliot
  
 Sam's problem was he would always compare himself
 to other people. I told him, Sam, you don't need to be
 a hero. But now I can see I was wrong. I wanted him 
 to be heroic, but not in that guerilla theater way.
 I told him, Sam, it's time to take off the puppet head.
 You could give him a little credit, though, for standing up
 against corporate hegemony. He always buys his coffee
 from locally owned establishments, and he shoplifts
 all those books of poetry from Barnes and Noble. 
 Oh, everyone deserves a little credit. All the angry
 little men in angry little rooms can write
 their diagnoses, xerox their zines, and dream
 that someday they'll become the next Debord.
 In the meantime, how am I supposed to live?
 None of us is getting any younger. Power clutches

 everyone with a velvet embrace. But isn't
 a life deformed by constant struggle a life
 as much defined by power's rule as one

        III. BALLAD OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
  
 "Loving a music man ain't always
 what it's supposed to be, she thought
 as the fang pierced her heel and she sank.
 This is the song of love and the law,
 of what is enduring and what disappears.
  
 Dissolving, her eye met its twin in the water
 (or was it a glass in the guise of a stream?)
 In the cafe, the boys drank to Orpheus.
 Encircled by drafts on the tables and floor,
 he waved a half-wave and lit a Gitane. 
  
 Sirens we were used to, but so early?
 Through a window specked by last night's rain,
 I saw Wojohowicz give him the news,
 then returned to my book: The Invention of Chance.
 This is the song of atomic decay.
  
 Contemporary fascination
 with corporal preservation
 recapitulates the ancient
 ceremonies of atonement,
 or so, at least, it seems to me,
 as I lecture empty rooms
 on F.H. Bradley and the moon.
 Not the moon you lovers see,
 the moon as it appears to me
 and me alone, my eyes refined
 by distillation in the mind.
 My moon rains light through long night hours
 awake within the prison tower
 of internal experience,
 the tower holding thief and prince,
 stockbroker and the child of fame,
 identically, but not the same.
 One hears the scraping of the key.
 One wishes one were one, not me.
  
 Through darkness he descended to the platform.
 One quarter struck another. Buskers
 danced in supplication of the shadows,
 mirroring the disgraced King of Pop.
 White noise announced the train. Orpheus wept.
  
 After North and Clybourn comes Division,
 and after Division, the final law, whose lord
 sits anxiously beside his stolen bride.
 I will not pretend I know the song he sang
 before the dreadful pair. You know the stories
  
 as well as I: that from the gramophone 
 a swell of scratch and hurl and gem-like glint,
 of vouchsafed soul and breakbeats reconciled, 
 shattered the shale resolve of Death himself:
 edict turned to grace. But I can still
  
 remind you of the lesson coming up,
 paused as we are at the axis of our hope.
 Necessity may, for a moment, yield to love,
 but love explodes each moment in its drive
 to the next, and the next, and the next, like footsteps--
  
 With a sudden cry Sgt. Wojo averred:
 "The song of policemen has yet to be heard!
 You can call it ignoble, or even absurd,
 But my comrades have hung on each sibilant word,
 And we've waited and waited as locations blurred
 From subway to Hades: we've yet to be heard!
 Amid shouts of sha-hoobla, tik-tak, and tra-lay,
 The song of policemen now carried the day.
 Brass buttons new polished, bright jackets fresh pressed,
 And riot protectors protecting their chests,
 From buses and wagons policemen erupted,
 From storefronts and stations, and uninterrupted
 They sang as they rounded up each interloper:
 Each anti-war chanter, each car window soaper.
 They sang like a city-sized 8-track recorder,
 And phalanxed, Miranda'ed, preserved the disorder
 That the bravest policeman felt clutch at his heart
 From the untamed community begging his art.
 "Hey-hey-o, they sang, and such pleasant palaver,
 And then morning came. They were walking cadavers.
 They might tell funny stories, or wrestle, or shout,
 But something--divine spark? the soul?--had gone out.
 And all of the people and all of the streets
 And all of the sweet shops where young lovers meet
 Invisibly withered, and no one could say
 Where deadness had come from, how long it might stay. 
 But now Wojohowicz regrets his decision 
 To insert himself. There will be no revision.
 So he takes off his hat and he gives up his gun
 And that's how the song of the policemen is done. 
  
 Where were you then?
              I was at North and Clybourn.
  
 No one was with you?
             I was alone.
  
 And Death's dispensation?
             It came with conditions.
  
 Conditions you flouted?
             I slipped. The underworld does not forgive.
  
  
 When all aloud the wind is blowing,
    And coughing drowns the poet's song,
 And terminals brood softly glowing,
    And Marian wears a blue sarong,
  
 When synthecrabs squirm in the beaker,
 Then nightly hums the opaque speaker
             Tu-who;
 Tu-whit, tu-who--a subtle note,
 While Joan stirs on in a distant plot.
  
 Arm. The words of Mercury are oddly muted after the studies
    of Jessie Weston. You, that way: we, this way.
  
  
  
                     IV. GAZA STRIP
      
             A current under sea
 Picked his bones in whispers. And this I know.
 Forgot the way of gulls. He rose and fell.
 His teeth as white as snow.
  
 A current under sea. O you
 Walk her every day into the deep sea swell.
 She passed the stages of her age and youth.
 Orpheus wept. A big big love.
  
 O you who turn the wheel,
 Consider how his bones were picked,
 A fortnight dead. And this I know.
 Gentile or Phoenician, dark Don Juan,
 A big big love. A big big love. As tall as you.
  
  

                     V. DEATH TO POETRY
  


Orpheus awoke in the poem of disguises, the poem once called "The Waste Land. Friends, listen up. He gathered the remnants of the life he had dreamed. He renounced the burden of the name he bore. He began to walk.


Orpheus walked down Milwaukee Avenue toward the Flatiron Building. He passed bodegas, taquerias, vintage stores. He met a hustler with a gas can. He walked past the anarchist kids. And he walked, and he walked, and he walked past the cabdrivers trading insults in Urdu, and he walked past convenience stores, and he walked past Latin Kings, and he walked past waitresses getting off night shifts, and he walked past jazz stars that nobody recognized, he walked past the students, the teachers, the cops. And the sky was the color of eggplant and tire fires, the sky was the field that resisted exhaustion. And he walked, and he walked past the puddles and gutters. And no one walked with him. And SUVs burned, and the asphalt ran liquid and Orpheus saw the dissolving sky and he knew that the name of the poem he had entered could not be "The Waste Land or even "White Phosphorus, or "The Song of Policemen. In his pocket he fingered a tiny slip of paper. He opened and read it. It said, "This is the death of the poet. And yes. And yes. This is the death of the poet.

 
 Shhhh. I am allergic to melodrama.
  
  
 Shhhh. The serpent encircles the world.
  
  
 Shhhh. There is plausible explanation. 
  
 But watch it! the daughters of Ismara,
 Their heaving chests wrapped up in beastly fleece,
 From their hilltop perch, catch sight of Orpheus
 Smithing his voice to match plucked strings.
 Cunctaque tela forent cantu mollita, sed ingens
 Clamor et infracto Berecyntia tibia cornu
 Typanaque et plausus et Bacchei ululatus
 Obstrepuere sono citharae, tum denique saxa
 Non exauditi rubuerunt sanguine vatis.
 And the stones grew red with the blood of the poet.
 These footnotes have I shored against my ruins.
 These footnotes
                                        shhhh
                                                     we set foot
 in a world ash-sick, a bad dream world
 no longer the mirror, no longer the poem
  
 the birdless night grew colder
  

And once the poem ended, commentary began. I said, I, the author, said, "Orpheus is a mask in a poem infected with masks. I said, "The importance of footnotes cannot be overestimated. I said, "The essential problem of the poem is the essential problem of our time, of all time: how to love one another. And I was not, readers, Orpheus, and I did not descend into the depths, and I have only these words to defend me, and the shadows, the shadows howl for my blood
 
  
 Once more in the city he refused to name
 a phenomenon that I have often noticed
 Once more in the city that endures its fall
 Well then Ile fix you. Mackie's back in town
 Once more in the city called Barnes and Noble
 an elaborate deception, like a bird
 Once more in the city that everyone forgot
 and swerved to catch the sun on its wing
 cf. McGinty, Possum Among the Hoopoes
 a broken face, a city of dust and telescopy
 abandoned the ruse that had once been the poem
 and listened as the buildings lightly sang:
  
             Oh we'll meet again
             When all the rained out faces
             And all the bomb-scarred places
             Kiss me kiss me kiss me
             Under the telegraphic moon
             And I won't get up, I won't
             Get up, I'll never, never, never






Sonnets to Morpheus ["I know kung fu"]
 

 "I know kung fu. It won't bring back the world.
 5:15 a.m.: I wake from another dream,
 the same as every dream. A man builds a ship
 in my chest. Each of the sailors
 carries by her breast a picture of her sister.
 The ship is not the image of a ship.
 Beyond its sails there are no stars.
 The water is only water because it's black.
  
 5:15 a.m. Perhaps you've seen me
 practicing my moves in the empty prison yard
 and wondered whether you were the dreamer
 conjuring me into existence from the bare
 desire to caress a phantom ship
 and my death the death of your desire.

 Kids sneaking into The Story of O, the football scrimmage, and 
     Manhattan
 Ending, she sees the end of Paris and Fort Worth, she watches
     subways melt
 Sleeplessly, she knew how it all would work out, she trains her
     dials on the death
 Of kings sitting sadly by the waterfront shacks, she sees
     beyond the genius
 Of Edwards Teller, Hopper, and Lear. You and I are the trouble
     she's seen.
  
 Mary, wouldn't you like to come outside?
  
 Mary, Mary, when will you come outside?

 The sky was black. The sky was blue.
 I was sitting someplace. I saw it.

 The community got together, as communities will,
 And waited together for death. Some of us
 Were colorblind, so when they lifted the red flag
 To signal the drink, we had to be prodded
 By neighbors. In a couple of cases,
 There were clusters of the colorblind, after all
 A genetic trait: these familial bands
 Required repeated prodding by strangers
 On the outskirts. It produced a wavelike pattern,
 All this prodding, so that to an outside observer,
 One tuning in from remote satellite, for example, 
 It was reminiscent of a Busby Berkeley scene,
 Or one of those marching band routines
 In which the scrambling about of the sousaphone players
 Suddenly blossoms into a starfish or some kind of
 Risqu joke. But within fifteen minutes or so,
 The prodding subsided, and after that the drinking,
 The twitching, and we all lay dead in the field.

 After she emerged, she saw red, and it was red.
 She emerged, and saw yellow. She saw blue.
 After she emerged, she saw what green was like.
 She saw purple and orange and gray.







The New Experience
 

I was ready for a new experience.
 All the old ones had burned out.
  
 They lay in little ashy heaps along the roadside
 And blew in drifts across the fairgrounds and fields.
  
 From a distance some appeared to be smoldering 
 But when I approached with my hat in my hands
  
 They let out small puffs of smoke and expired.
 Through the windows of houses I saw lives lit up
  
 With the otherworldly glow of TV
 And these were smoking a little bit too.
  
 I flew to Rome. I flew to Greece.
 I sat on a rock in the shade of the Acropolis
  
 And conjured dusky columns in the clouds.
 I watched waves lap the crumbling coast.
  
 I heard wind strip the woods.
 I saw the last living snow leopard
  
 Pacing in the dirt. Experience taught me
 That nothing worth doing is worth doing
  
 For the sake of experience alone.
 I bit into an apple that tasted sweetly of time.
  
 The sun came out. It was the old sun
 With only a few billion years left to shine. 






On Normandy
 

Fate piles up
 On the bloody Norman shore.
 If you must swim there
 Swim on your back.






On Last Lines
 

The last line should strike like a lover's complaint.
 You should never see it coming.
 And you should never hear the end of it.






Enough
 

I am wearing dark glasses inside the house 
 To match my dark mood.
  
 I have left all the sugar out of the pie.
 My rage is a kind of domestic rage.
  
 I learned it from my mother
 Who learned it from her mother before her
  
 And so on.
 Surely the Greeks had a word for this.
  
 Now surely the Germans do. 
 The more words a person knows
  
 To describe her private sufferings
 The more distantly she can perceive them.
  
 I repeat the names of all the cities I've known
 And watch an ant drag its crooked shadow home.
  
 What does it mean to love the life we've been given?
 To act well the part that's been cast for us?
  
 Wind. Light. Fire. Time.  
 A train whistles through the far hills.
  
 One day I plan to be riding it. 






Vanishing Interior
 

Little patches of grass disappear
 In the jaws of lusty squirrels
  
 Who slip into the spruce.
 Cars collapse into parts.
  
 Spring dissolves into summer,
 The kitten into the cat.
  
 A tray of drinks departs from the buffet
 And voil! the party's over.
  
 All that's left are some pickles
 And a sprig of wilting parsley on the rug.
  
 When I think of all those 
 Gong-tormented Mesozoic seas
  
 I feel a ripple of extinction
 And blow a smoke ring through the trees.
  
 Soon there will be nothing left here but sky.
 When I think about the fact
  
 I am not thinking about you
 It is a new way of thinking about you.

                       for an eye injury, sack of flour, sack of salt,
                                             dusty bag of bones
                                                          collapsed

                             Why does Turner
                                  come to mind,
                                                         those shackled ankles,

                                        and asked for gunshots
                                                      to stop for just one hot hour?

Admit Possession to Rent
 

We stopped at a farmer's house
 before parking at the dock
 that creaked over the river.
 Rowboats for rent, five bucks
 an hour, twenty for the day. 
 Deep water: I knew a canvas bag
  
 was in the trunk. I knew lunch
 would be roast beef sandwiches
 and hot stew from a thermos,
 chunks of carrot and potatoes
 cut by my mother who slept
 through the racket of our leaving.
  
 While my father paid, I loaded
 the boat with our poles
 and tackle boxes, lead sinkers
 shaped like grey pears, raincoats
 and a case of beer. I was ten
 and I knew my dad would toss
  
 that canvas bag into the aluminum
 boat with a thunk. We fish for gar
 with kittens, he'd yelled last night
 at my mother, and that was that.
 The rowboat slid from the dock,
 the occasional clunk of the first
  
 six-pack clipped on the fish stringer,
 and I knew that I should take my time
 fastening the wire leader
 to the brass swivel, tying on
 those massive sinkers. I knew 
 that the six-inch treble hook
  
 would tremble in my hands,
 and when I was done, I knew 
 what came next, a canvas bag,
 stiff kittens, blood. I tore
 two hooks through the side
 of a calico, yanked upward with a 
  
 sharp tug to lodge the third barb
 beneath the ribs. I dangled 
 my fingers in cold water
 to wash them, then reared
 the rod back into a cast that splashed
 twenty feet from the boat.
  
 He popped the third beer and finished
 baiting his hook. Too deep
 for an anchor, we drifted,
 and far beneath, the gar cruised 
 back and forth, their prehistoric 
 snouts slicing the dark, bumping
  
 our bait again and again
 until that fierce hunger I was learning
 said clamp down and take it.






The Book of Failed Descriptions
 

Myth is prison, a palace,
 truth without fact.
  
 Myth is birth and pleasure, teeth and death,
               sharp shiver of that which is broken.
  
 Myth is patriarchal and worn,
               full of fratricide and rape.
  
 Myth is a garden, makes good television,
               memoir,
               the scandal of animals
               and people
               coupling beneath the stars.
  
 Myth is crow eating roadkill and dodging the occasional cars,
               a pile of guts and bones.
  
 Myth is carrying the body back to the den.
  
                             Close your eyes and count to ten.

 Ultrasound images of my heart.
 That it moves and moves

 plump muscle

 I gather a lock of his hair,
 a scrap of T-shirt, a baby tooth,
 his tiny spoon, a diaper pin with a blue plastic stork,
 the quilted blanket, his first steps,
 hands clutching my fingers, the long night
 when his fever rose to 104,
 his split lip at age six when he jumped with outspread
 arms, the first shoe, a locket with a toddler photo,
 first day of school, first finger painting,
 the green cardboard sculpture
 like something shaped by Breton, T-ball
 games, the flopping trout he squeezed too hard,
 his first broken bone, his fear when he felt
 my trembling hands trying to tell him
 something about the sun.

 Fishing in the desert creek
 a few days after the hearing,
 I find bones, steer skulls
 with round sockets for horns,
 and step near three rattlesnakes,
 almost grab a fourth
 when climbing a steep bank.
 The snakes were sluggish, though,
 late spring when the temperatures
 in the desert dipped into the thirties
 at night. Only one rattled,
 and the rain of the previous days
 made the fishing terrible, water brown
 and swift. I didn't get a bite
 and drove home, bought
 a bucket of fried chicken,
 and ate in front of the television
 his clothes still hanging in a closet.

 stand still
 for a moment,
 then hunch toward

He jumps into my arms, and I catch him.

Eponymous
 

I am unable to jump more than ten feet in the air.
 I am blind. I am unable to understand the dark
 passages. I begin to speak of being deprived.
 I believe that I am being kept in want. Who
 governs me? Who is to say what I am,
 and what I am not? I wish to be conscious
 of myself. My frontiers are long and insecure.
 I contract them. I cannot command them.
 I determine myself not to desire what is
 unattainable. I have a wound in my leg.
 I am a schoolboy. A rule does not oppress me
 if I impose it on myself. I assimilate it
 into my substance. I can never be thwarted.
 I cannot want it to be other than it is. 






In Eight Parts
 

i.
    
 I grew up an anxious painting by my dad's shaking hand.
 In the painting of my dad, a quiet hole beats
 through the dull, black night. I'm heir to an orange heart
 in the rhythmic black where a man leans quietly 
 and wonders. I wonder about my dad, a hole
 in my painting. I used to think my dad was dull,
 but his shaking hand gave rhythm to my body.
 In my dad's painting, a hole glows orange in the dull night
 where I sit beneath the canvas looking up.
 My dad looks down and laughs.
 When I went into my dad's painting and saw a man
 lean toward a bright, orange hole, night shook
 through my shirt in an inherited rhythm, duplicating 
 the heart held by his anxious body. My painting 
 a laughing dad. My heart a hole where on a bright,
 orange night, I dropped a tattered shirt, shaking.
  

ii.
    
 My dad said the man was meant
 to be looking at the painting he's in,
 but it didn't quite work. And so the hole
 where he's looking now. The finger-thick lines
 around him don't hide a failed painting
 or reveal any struggle to mean.
 My dad believes in action and the truth
 of process: a man looks into a hole
 and so he is. He looks past the hole
 to what brought him to it. The tattered
 painting doesn't work as finger-thick
 evidence of his struggle to mean,
 but the correspondence of his belief 
 shakes through its presence. To believe in holes
 and men looking into them. To lean
 toward action and the presence of process
 where a man looks at the painting he's in and is.


iii.
  
 A man looks at the hole he's in and laughs.
 He never thought about what the colors mean,
 the hole bright orange in the black night.
 Like babies painting a painting of babies,
 the man laughs at the hole he's in and looks down
 to feel his heart beneath a tattered shirt.
 He's shaking like an old man's dad.
 Is a man the hole he falls into?
 Colors are the correspondence of babies--
 they lean and fall into the holes we leave them.
 A baby looks at the hole he's in and laughs.
 He shakes, no colors or dads to hold him still.


iv.  
  
 My dad's fingers spilled around the surface 
 without distinction, causing the offense                        
 we call process. The painting, having the grace
 of endurance, allows the line its tiny provocation,
 but lacking the confrontation that would compel
 the painting into itself--the man looks down,
 not in; we look at, not through. The painting
 communicates by presence alone, letting us know
 that it's here without a message, or a message
 embodied in its delivery, a swallowed swallow.
 The man and the hole he looks into are homage
 to us. The man doesn't have a mouth,
 the hole doesn't have a shape.
 Our provocation is presence alone. 
  

v.
  
 I used to went into my dad's painting I grew up In
 When I dull black orange heart wonder about quiet 
 and saw a man      I      my dad      a hole rhythmic wonders

 beats of my dad where I sit In a orange hole
 black where my night shirt shook a tattered night
 in the canvas      in the dull shirt        and a man leans
 by shaking hand       I dropped a laughing dad
 beneath an orange night     an orange hole
 quietly my dad in duplicating heart

 My heart      the looking toward a hole

 but the painting he's in is presence
 He looks tattered     The man looking so finger-thick

 to the painting he's in     And the hole
 it didn't quite mean what brought him to it
 evidence of his process reveal the man was meant a hole
 of My action at the dad of any truth
 To mean in looks      and of looks to be
 don't hide my dad at work     toward his past
 he is the hole the painting believes in
 but shakes around failed action    struggle to lean through
 for process where a man and a struggle and a painting
 as to him     and so To belief      or its presence
 said to believe in holes and men looking into them
  

vii.
  
 the hole looks at A man he's in and shakes
 Like A baby looks at the correspondence of babies
 and laughs     He bright and orange painting
 never a man he falls into       Colors are of babies
 the colors mean no colors     they lean
 night babies painting a black still hole about dads
 he's the hole we fall into     the holes in his shaking heart
 in the thought leave them     and down the what hole
 He's like a tattered shirt      the man laughs at the looks
 he's an old man's hole    to feel beneath dad
 or to hold the laughs He Is in him
  
viii.
    
 we call a swallow homage to provocation
 the hole doesn't have a message
 fingers in its delivery lacking grace
 but the man looks down without endurance
 confrontation embodied    swallowed
 causing the process of presence
 having shape    letting us know that it's there
 not in    not without a message     a tiny surface
 My dad's distinction allows The painting its mouth
 spilled The man through The painting
 the line we look at     the painting into
 or around      Our man looks into that
 the offense would he alone have
 The us and the is are
 by presence alone the hole communicates itself
 the provocation doesn't compel






I Love Country Music
 

Sometimes we blubbered through the fallout
 of willful confusion in pants that didn't fit the legs
 we sawed off. We looked at each other and fell
 forward and back, forward and back, a little bit
 like dancing and a little like aggravated assault.
 At times it seemed reasonable because it always
 seems reasonable to accept whatever anxieties
 or losses must accumulate in the face of what
 we really wanted all along. In buildings and on
 streets you could paint a few eyes on a face 
 and see the careless representation of brothers
 and sisters making a family out of paint
 and the gracious mistakes of seeing. Mistakes,
 the essence of sight, could have been all we had 
 to go on anyway, and not for us to leave behind
 what took us through the shower of dumbasses
 with tact and a breath of elegance, even the hope
 that later, when the streets cleared of agitated needlers
 and the AC kicked on for good, we could sleep
 on the clothes spangled outside the closet and find 
 a reason for closing the bedroom door on shadows
 of pedantic radiation from thin margins of lamplight
 always suggesting some other plot in some other bedroom,
 tensions to splay us soon enough. And then it occurred
 to you, or maybe it occurred to me, doesn't matter, I think
 actually someone called and said that anyone who doesn't 
 leave something for you isn't worth having, so maybe
 now's a good time to find a dapper little high school
 where everyone can be a little less civil, and blessed
 with selfishness, we could part the fingers interlocked
 between us, make fists and get busy. Then intensity
 fermented into green books of music, loud country music,
 and I love country music. It rolled around my ears
 in corridors where boredom had once been so irrefutable
 and heavy, and I was happy and dancing and throwing
 punches at pigeons and even hitting a few. But the romantic
 arc never made it over the willful lack of conviction,
 some gap between the faces on the heads we saw
 pass our table in the sour-faced restaurant run by those
 French people, okay a gap between that and the face
 in the dream you had of your father, the one where you said
 he stuffed a billy club down a duck's throat and called 
 for another shot of Dewar's. I expected you to take things 
 when you left, but not those things. Light diffuses
 evenly across the kitchen, blood through my body,
 and it's sort of funny, but our whole thing fits between
 two haircuts, like a roadtrip or something. I feel now
 that I've been digested by time, and light would pool
 into terrible reflections of my own back as I backed 
 into a mirror or performed some other forgetful jujitsu,
 an effort to lose thoughts or patterns of thought,
 but the light diffuses and you walk through it,
 collide with little pieces of what ate you, get angry
 and write long letters about how your hand can't talk,
 how the paper is so light and effortless when you hold it
 how could you even know, you couldn't even imagine
 holding this light and ridiculous thing that my hand
 brushed over in patterns it will later try to forget.
 Then I taped my mouth shut and tried to whistle.
 Leave me alone. Don't call. Get lost, dumpster
 of confusion. I know it's never been that easy,
 that from the eyes in your skull the black plastic bags
 were suffocating the trees even though to me it was
 more like a ballerina's shadow had escaped and was dancing 
 through the branches frantically with desperate happiness
 and cause for alarm. I guess either way something unsafe
 and ridiculous was happening, and I guess we knew it,
 I think we even talked about it, but I've been a little lonely
 since I started writing my dissertation. It's about class
 consciousness among people who work behind registers.
 And it's interesting, there's all kinds of different races
 and classes and income levels represented in the world
 of cashiers, but at the level of values we see predominantly 
 two classes, the complacent and the entitled, though many
 cashiers are some measure of both. The complacent
 are resigned to what they understand to be their position.
 They're courteous and reliable; class issues only arise
 when people are rude to them, which they tend to handle fine,
 though if they say anything about it afterwards, it tends to be
 a cruel and brief dismissal not only of the occurrence,
 but of the entire offending person. The entitled
 have a very complicated expression of social hierarchy.
 Because they see themselves in transition,
 usually ascending, there's this idea that their values won't,
 or can't, find full expression from their current position 
 and so they don't feel compelled to act in a way consistent
 with their values, while at the same time they may expect
 to be treated in accordance with those values. When people
 are rude to them, they flip out. Basically today's been pasted 
 together from the leavings of some green intensity
 and cigarettes crowded at the back of the passive
 classrooms of the skull. Will there be coffee
 on the other side? Will there be ladies to walk up to you
 on a plain old shit-for-brains day and ask you of Washington
 Square Park, "Why is this on the map? I like it when people
 cock their heads a little when you talk. Seems elegant.
 I tell them I'm not sure, but Henry James wrote something
 complicated about it. Then these nice ladies with a telling lack 
 of accent move along into non-history and the bulk of our hours
 waiting without a mind for restitution. I would surrender
 our moist telephone calls and arthritic tribes of entitlement
 if I knew who to give them up to. I never go anywhere             
 or do anything slow because revision is only a function
 of doubt. Well okay, maybe doubt and shame. Actually,
 it's just shame. Revision is a function of shame. But enough 
 of these dead people, we must rise like blood in April! Instead
 here I am peeling seconds off the end of my life,
 glass of water, frown on face, notebook open to the parade
 of minutes and obvious as a daisycutter in the desert. 
 No more nights in the kitchen or bowls of macaroni,
 no more misdemeanors with the microwave or blue orbs
 whistling into my ear, no more cats meowing
 at the television, no cigarettes on the patio, no more
 blessings in drag. My schedule is totally blank this afternoon.





The Blessing of the Old Woman, the Tulip, and the Dog
 

To be blessed 
said the old woman 
is to live and work 
so hard 
God's love 
washes right through you 
like milk through a cow

To be blessed 
said the dark red tulip 
is to knock their eyes out 
with the slug of lust 
implied by 
your up-ended skirt

To be blessed 
said the dog 
is to have a pinch 
of God 
inside you 
and all the other 
dogs can smell it

Escape from the Old Country
 

I never had to make one,
 no sickening weeks by ocean,
  
 no waiting for the aerogrammes
 that gradually ceased to come.
  
 Spent the babysitting money
 on novels, shoes, and movies,
  
 yet the neighborhood stayed empty.
 It had nothing to do with a journey
  
 not undertaken, not with dialect,
 nor with a land that waited
  
 to be rediscovered, then rejected.
 As acid rain collected
  
 above the suburban hills, I tried
 to imagine being nothing, tried
  
 to be able to claim, "I have
 no culture, and be believed.
  
 Yet the land occupies the person
 even as the semblance of freedom
  
 invites a kind of recklessness.
 Tradition, unobserved, unasked,
  
 hangs on tight; ancestors roam
 into reverie, interfering at the most
  
 awkward moments, first flirtations,
 in doorways and dressing rooms--
  
 But of course. Here in America,
 no one escapes. In the end, each traveler
  
 returns to the town where, everyone
 knew, she hadn't even been born.





China III
 

It is too much a part of things,
 even though the source is not within.
  
 In small American cities
 with and without universities,
  
 it keeps a constant presence
 in the Confucian sense,
  
 the inner arriving to match
 the outer, spirit not separate
  
 from matter (the latter illusion
 left by the missions
  
 the people have made such fine
 use of). There are times
  
 when you have to pretend
 to embrace an idea or befriend
  
 your adversaries. If constantly
 misinterpreted, use the mystery
  
 as currency. You have to start
 somewhere. Be wise: depart
  
 from where they've already put you.
 A country itself can't betray you.






Adolescence
 

The trouble was not about finding acceptance.
 Acceptance was available in the depths of the mind
 And among like people. The trouble was the look into the canyon
 Which had come a long time earlier
 And spent many years being forgotten.
  
 The fine garments and rows of strong shoes,
 The pantry stocked with good grains and butter--
 Everything could be earned by producing right answers.
 Answers were important, the canyon said,
 But the answers were not the solution.
  
 A glimpse into the future had shown the prairie
 On which houses stood sturdily.
 The earth was moist and generous, the sunlight benevolent.
 The homesteaders dreamed up palaces and descendants,
 And the animals slept soundly as stones.
  
 It was a hard-earned heaven, the self-making
 Of travelers, and often, out on the plains,
 Mirages rose of waterfalls, moose, and rows of fresh-plowed soil,
 But nobody stopped to drink the false water.
 Real water being plentiful, they were not thirsty.
  
 A few made their fortunes from native beauty,
 Others from native strength, but most from knowledge,
 As uncertainties in science could be written off to faith.
 Faith was religious and ordinary life physical,
 And spiritual was a song that had not yet arrived.





Things Chinese
 

Once, I tried to banish them all from my writing.
 This was America, after all, where everyone's at liberty
 To remake her person, her place, or her poetry,
  
 And I lived in a town a long way from everything--
 Where discussions of "diversity
 Centered mainly on sexuality.
  
 My policy, born of exhaustion with talk about race
 And the quintessentially American wish for antecedents,
 Eliminated most of my family, starting with the grandparents,
  
 Two of whom stayed Chinese to their final days,
 Two of whom were all but defined by their expertise
 On the food of the country I was trying to excise.
  
 It canceled out the expensive center
 Of an intense undergraduate curriculum
 And excluded the only foreign language I could talk in.
  
 It wiped out my parents' earliest years
 And converted them to 1950s Georgians
 Who'd always attended church and school, like anyone.
  
 My father had never paused at two water fountains
 And asked a white man which he should drink from,
 And never told his children what the answer had been.
  
 My mother had never arranged a migration,
 Solo at seventeen, from Taipei to wherever,
 But had simply appeared in Gainesville out of ether,

 And nothing about their original languages
 Had brought them together. Their children
 Had never needed to explain to anyone
  
 Why distinctness and mystery were not advantages
 When they were not optional, and never wondered
 If particular features had caused particular failures.
  
 For months I couldn't write anything decent
 Because banned information kept trying to enter
 Like bungled idioms in the speech of a foreigner.
  
 I was my own totalitarian government,
 An HMO that wouldn't pay for a specialist,
 And I was the dissident or patient who perished.
  
 The hope was to transcend the profanity of being
 Through the dissolution of description and story,
 Which I thought might turn out to be secondary
  
 To a semi-mystical state of unseeing,
 But everywhere I went there was circumstance,
 All of it strangely tainted by my very presence.





A Pornography
 

There was a time when I watched it happen.
 Strangers pressed to other strangers
 in one bed, clothes on, air humid
 with the cloying scent of fruit juice
 and vodka; none of us
 giving into another and yet unwilling to leave the scene
 of that possibility,
 pretending to sleep, actually sleeping.
 Then waking again to slip a hand
 over a shoulder, slide a finger
 inside the waistband of a skirt; so young
 (we are even now still
 so young) in that hotel room
 turning blue then lighter blue.
 We wouldn't have tried for more:
 the kiss, the button; firm, white shape
 of an image slipped wholly into the mind,
 acted upon, dreamed upon,
 filling the thin vessels of the lungs.
  
 Earlier, a film, its forced sounds
 of lovemaking. The tension I felt winding
 into the muscles of some of the others in the room.
 I remember I left for awhile.
 We all left for awhile;
 even the music was frightening. How
 to strip ourselves like that, point
 at the places that were wanted, plucked
 and peeled; speaking the words, hearing them form us,
 the nature of what we were
 and could do to each other?
 The music, the rocking, the sobbing.
 The man called the woman by parts of herself.
 Some laughed at this. I remember
 I must have been one of them.
 In the morning, the hotel room was turning white.
 After the long night, hands were slipping
 and unslipping, moving over the flattened pillows
 as if in hopes something small could still satisfy us.
 Someone turned and looked at someone else;
 we all heard it. Legs
 shifted, sheets slid themselves down waists
 or shoulders, tightened again at the necks
 of those pretending to sleep as the unblinking sun
 crawled in our window.
 From another room, coughing,
 We all heard it.
 Someone looked at someone else.
 The room turned white. The air began clearing.






Ode
 

And now the silver, ripping sound of white on white, the satin,
 light snow torn
 under wheels, car bang metally grenading, and the wood poles,
 whipping, loom--
  

                                     
 
 I have always wanted to sing a song of praise
  
 for the unscathed: myself
 stepping from the fractured car whose black axle's one inch
 from gone; slim pole slicing cable
  
 up to sheet metal, seat foam, corduroy
 (like butter, the mechanic will later
 tell me, poking a stiff finger through the cloth),
 to pierce the exact point
  
 I was supposed to sit, stopping
 because praise begins where pain
 transfigures itself,
 stoppered by a deeper kind of joy: so I
 transfigure myself from driver
  
 to survivor, the blessed Lazarine failure
  
 bolting up and opening her eyes.
 And here are the thousand wrecks
 from a life configured in snow before me: myself,
 at five, pulled from the burning car seat;
 at twelve, bleeding from the scalp
 after the car throws me from my bike; at fourteen,
 tumbling over the slick hood rushing;
 sockets of windows with glass
 bashed out into a translucent, toothy ring; lights
 and bumpers clipped clean off; tires burst; deer
 gravitationally hurled through my windshield; brakes
 given out and worse,
  
 the icy loop de loops
 on roads, the trucker's 18 fat wheels squealing--
 All the ways technology should have killed me
  
 and didn't.
 Praise for my death-hungry luck!
 And all the manner in which I've failed it--
 marriage lost,
  
 buried in the blanks of white space, my solitude
 at the Greyhound station
 knowing no one to retrieve me,
 carless among the other pressed tight
 to their own disaster or boredom--
 unbearably young mothers,
  
 drifters, boy soldiers
 shoulder to shoulder with the insane, weaving
 the same thread of conversation back and forth
 between ourselves. How
  
 could this happen to me
 at this age, at this stage, how
 did I not notice, and will you put this seat up?
 and will you lend me this quarter? and will you 
 call me a cab when we get back home?
  
 The young man in the seat before me, head
 full of zigzagging tight braids says,
  
 Sure you can dig up that ballot box in Florida
 and while you're at it look up all the bones
 buried in the Everglades, repeats it
  
 for the amusement of the woman across from him,
 who knows a presidential failure like she knows herself,
 and when we pass my accident on the road points
 and whistles, snickers:  Bet you no one walked away from that one.
  
 For this, and for all these things: praise
  
 to the white plains of Wyoming, highway coiled
 like a length of rime-colored rope; to snow
 broiling in the sunlight so that the landscape
 takes on a nuclear glow, so bright
  
 we have to shield our eyes from it. Praise
 for myself playing at morbidity
 because I thought I had a right to it
  
 as if flesh had to follow spirit
 to such a pure depth the bones themselves
 could not rest but must be broken, nerves
 singed then ripped out, the heart clenched madly in its chest.
  
 As if I had nothing except this white earth, this
 smashed car to praise
  
 what I knew before and know 
 even better now, the hills
 cold as a hip bone and tufted with ice. Praise
 to my youth and to my age, praise
  
 to ambition and small-mindedness,
 the kind I recognize and the kind
 I am soon to recognize; praise
  
 to self-hatred for it keeps me alive, and praise
 for the splinters of delight that can pierce it.
 Praise for wood pole, praise for glass.
 Praise for muscle, praise for bone.
  
 The sky is bright as a bowl on a nurse's table today.
  
 And the sun gleams into it as our bus slides by,
 the light of us a wash of gold illuminating
 bodies lost, bodies regained; gleaming
  
 like my heart here, on this earth,
 bloody and still beating.





Rubbed
 


It's a simple resistance
 
between the pull of springs
and struggle of joints: two coiled
silver muscles working
in the lamp against blue washers
and pivot plates, locking nut
coolly swiveling loose with age.
 
In the arm
 
it's done with blood:
tissues plumped then promptly deflated.
 
What else am I supposed to start with?
 
Not the light bulb, to which
this whole narrative yearns, loving
the glass envelope sizzling with light,
grasshopper antennae scrubbed
with electricity until each filament's turned to fire.
 
No, I have to start with the arm first, the mint-blue
lamp, then maybe light itself to specify
what startles me
 
about you, globe of hot fruit, Christ heart
throbbing in the open chest; curtains of robe parted
just enough to see what afterglow defines us, waits for us,
rubbing its slow music out into the wet dark--
 
Tonight, I'm counting out my seeds of waiting for you
 
through a current that is silent
and might always be,
though it thrums in every gesture:
like this white eye burning within the metal shade
I carefully adjust
over a plate of orange slices each evening.






God is President, Shes the Rose of the World
 

When it's that time of month
 it's like falling backwards in "time.
  
 God has abandoned her glass carriage,
 she is "dead.
  
 And the edges of objects: wavy
 in the eye that's about to cry,
  
 a twitter running down the spine of
 Oh God, it can't be. (Insert song of mourning.)
  
 God and time, spine of the world -- yawn, blah, blah, schma
 what I meant to say is
  
 it's hard to be a capitalist.
  
 If the world's time is God, and she's birds
 atwitter, then why must I go to work?
 The answer writes itself:
  
 left to my own devices I'd just sink into the soil.
 That is, write, with dirt
  
 as my pillow.   In the hole between twitters
  
 there's random patches
 of mud-sky. So humid.
  
 There're chairs growing in hell.
  
 There're chairs growing in hell,
 and people sit on them, my co-workers:
 it's like riding on toadstools
 except you don't know it, or
 you kind of know it that time of
  
 month.
 That's when you feel the twitter, the muddy shiver.
  
 You dream of your uncle turning a lamb on a spit
 high on a green cliff, with fog thickening around him
  
 and then he's made to swallow keys and little hammers--
  
 you claw the red clay.
 Now wake.
 Show me the bouquet!
  
 No, don't show me the bouquet.
  
 Show me the bouquet!
 If you do, I won't tell on you
  
 to the rose of the world. She can make him hear you up there.
 Besides, it's not a cliff, it's a chair.
  
 And the rose is God.
 Got it?
 Gott it?
  
 This is why women should be President.





Swan
 

Amy, Amy, at this distance you're
 the smell of liver,
 tinnitus that keeps me up, afraid:
 your fortressness must now be tested.
 The way you took me in without
 a surfeit click or
  
 gesture: seagull kerchief
 binding my gut to safety
 on the swimming haul
 among night-images.       I went to the place I was born
 and it plainly was a bride. So I ran after her.
  
 When she turned into a star I swallowed her.
 And out of this uneasiness will come
 an aster.
  
 Amy, I'm inside my granddad's mind of wood:
 the grass is finer, constellations thicker.
 The plums are normal. How
  
 much sugar did you buy
 alone at Waldbaums?
 Brook reeds here
  
 wake from your hair's soul's chilly patronage.
 The hair's the soul, the reeds
 its body--alone in their beds
  
 like schoolgirls:
 I feel and feel them up.
 The cigarettes
 have made them crazy! But a rabbit someone 
 flows out of the embankment
  
 and I shiver for you, Amy
 oh lengthy dappled wig:
 there's a swan in your breathing.
  
 There always is.






A Kind of Headless Guilt Emerges
 

I'm alone until I'm asleep, and there you are: naked,
 you take my hand: Shhhh! We
  
 tiptoe through a 
 black-blue meadow. To the pond behind the farmhouse. (The farmer
  
 sleeps in the blind window.) No cicadas even,
 maybe just maybe Venus -- & this is before Wednesday, everything's 
                  alright, we
  
 tiptoe round the house as around a painful subject -- & we're at the pond!
 And now it's time. To use vague holy-man speech, like: I am
  
 another face in your hand, the face of your eye -- wing-surrogates, the word
 bones --
  
 it's time for afternoon, them white-blank architectures.
 No, veil. Nothing's glistening. Christmas, Christmas. It's time
  
 for you to forgive me: I was forced to eat valises
 that wouldn't close by themselves --
  
 that was just a dream, good morning:
  
 regurgitate the stars and the soot





The Sleep of the Tuba-Player
 

The tuba wakes before the man. It's a content animal:
 having no word, for the moment, suits it fine.
  
 It looks at him with a dun and smooth
 interiority, as a glass of rum might,
  
 or a worn number on an apartment building:
 his hands, crossed on the chest, rise and fall with breathing.
  
 In the dream, he's ringing the bell now; climbing,
 unlocking the door, peering into a glass.
  
 The flat is empty. Is the war over yet? Or
 was he here before the war? Soon, dropping salt levels
  
 will wake him--
  
 in tears, with an odd groove in his palm, as though
 he'd held on to an instrument for hours.
  
 For a good minute, he'll be nameless, and when
 a name does come, it won't be his:
  
 humming in thought the bright last name
 he rang on the doorbell, he'll see, in a certain
  
 abrupt sunlight: he'd chosen
 her, then--
 to be able to call everything something.





Contraction
 

Honest self-scrutiny too easily mutinies,
    mutates into false memories
Which find language a receptive host,
Boosted by boastful embellishments.

Self-esteem is raised on wobbly beams,
    seeming seen as stuff enough
To fund the hedge of personality,
Though personally, I cannot forget

Whom I have met and somehow wronged,
    wrung for a jot of fugitive juice,
Trading some ruse for a blot or two,
Labored to braid from transparent diction

Fiction, quick fix, quixotic fixation.
    As the pulse of impulses
Drained through my veins, I tried to live
Twenty lives at once. Now one is plenty.   







Football
 

I take the snap from the center, fake to the right, fade back...
I've got protection. I've got a receiver open downfield...
What the hell is this? This isn't a football, it's a shoe, a man's
brown leather oxford. A cousin to a football maybe, the same
skin, but not the same, a thing made for the earth, not the air.
I realize that this is a world where anything is possible and I
understand, also, that one often has to make do with what one
has. I have eaten pancakes, for instance, with that clear corn
syrup on them because there was no maple syrup and they
weren't very good. Well, anyway, this is different. (My man
downfield is waving his arms.) One has certain responsibilities,
one has to make choices. This isn't right and I'm not going
to throw it.





In Praise of My Bed
 

At last I can be with you!
The grinding hours
since I left your side!
The labor of being fully human,
working my opposable thumb,
talking, and walking upright.
Now I have unclasped
unzipped, stepped out of.
Husked, soft, a be-er only,
I do nothing, but point
my bare feet into your
clean smoothness
feel your quiet strength
the whole length of my body.
I close my eyes, hear myself
moan, so grateful to be held this way.





['Joy of my life, full oft for loving you']
 

Joy of my life, full oft for loving you
    I bless my lot, that was so lucky placed:
    But then the more your own mishap I rue,
    That are so much by so mean love embased.
For had the equal heavens so much you graced
    In this as in the rest, ye might invent
    Some heavenly wit, whose verse could have enchased
    Your glorious name in golden monument.
But since ye deign'd so goodly to relent
    To me your thrall, in whom is little worth,
    That little that I am shall all be spent
    In setting your immortal praises forth;
Whose lofty argument uplifting me
    Shall lift you up unto an high degree.







['Often rebuked, yet always back returning']
 

Often rebuked, yet always back returning
    To those first feelings that were born with me,
And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning
    For idle dreams of things which cannot be:

To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region;
    Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear;
And visions rising, legion after legion,
    Bring the unreal world too strangely near.

I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces,
    And not in paths of high morality,
And not among the half-distinguished faces,
    The clouded forms of long-past history.

I'll walk where my own nature would be leading:
    It vexes me to choose another guide:
Where the gray flocks in ferny glens are feeding;
    Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side.

What have those lonely mountains worth revealing?
    More glory and more grief than I can tell:
The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling
    Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell. 







In the Past
 

There lies a somnolent lake
Under a noiseless sky,
Where never the mornings break
Nor the evenings die.

Mad flakes of colour 
Whirl on its even face
Iridescent and streaked with pallour;
And, warding the silent place,

The rocks rise sheer and gray
From the sedgeless brink to the sky
Dull-lit with the light of pale half-day
Thro' a void space and dry.

And the hours lag dead in the air 
With a sense of coming eternity
To the heart of the lonely boatman there:
That boatman am I,

I, in my lonely boat,
A waif on the somnolent lake,
Watching the colours creep and float
With the sinuous track of a snake.

Now I lean o'er the side
And lazy shades in the water see,
Lapped in the sweep of a sluggish tide
Crawled in from the living sea;

And next I fix mine eyes,
So long that the heart declines,
On the changeless face of the open skies
Where no star shines;

And now to the rocks I turn,
To the rocks, around
That lie like walls of a circling sun
Wherein lie bound

The waters that feel my powerless strength
And meet my homeless oar
Labouring over their ashen length
Never to find a shore.

But the gleam still skims
At times on the somnolent lake,
And a light there is that swims
With the whirl of a snake;

And tho' dead be the hours i' the air,
And dayless the sky,
The heart is alive of the boatman there:
That boatman am I.





Mustang Bagel
 

Even at my favorite coffeeshop downtown, Redford
is a hard man to feed. This morning, he picks
at his Grilled Asiago Mastercrust with a slow, disdainful frown.
Could they spare the fromage on this so-called "treat?"
He takes a sip of hazelnut coffee, then winces delicately
into the neck of his sweater vest. I bite powerfully
through my Cinnamon Frenchroll: Well, if you really don't think
you got enough--"fromage"--you should just go back up there
& tell the girl. I start on Redford's coffee while he looks glumly
at the metal napkin dispenser. Just then, the electric chime
above the door sounds. A man sweeps in & rests
his guitar case on one of the slim       caf chairs.
His dark hair is arranged in a series of perpetually
break wavefronts. A small muscle jumps in his jaw
as he orders a Cinnamon Frenchroll, toasted, with cream cheese.
I lean foward, jabbing Redford with my plastic coffee wand.
Check out that guy over there I say. Intense.
Redford shrugs. I think he's Irish I say, watching the man bite
into his bagel. The instrument case hovers on the chair edge.
He could have a guitar in there, or else--a sword from the Crusades.
I press my tongue into the square-shaped hole in the lid
of my coffee cup. Listen Redford says. If we're going to be together
you have to take this. He pushes a small velvet box across the table.
What are you doing? I ask, but Redford doesn't answer.
He just looks down at the table, one hand pressed
to each of his temples. In the box is a square of chocolate
like the top of a signet ring, smooth, but edged
in something bright. It's smoked salt from Wales, Redford says.
Handmade in limited quantities. I turn the little box
in my hands. The salt sparkles like an arctic church.
I have to blink against it all.





Secret Ninja
 

You thought you saw me!
But you didn't.
I wear black turtlenecks.
Black panties.
Live in a tall cave!

You don't know where my cave is.
But I come out.
Every day!
To buy mustard & relish!
See what--

A man.
Walking away from me.
No good.
Smash him!
With a loud smash!
Smash his metal table and cards.
Good!

Down in my cave.
Put on my Seahawk gear!
Watch Parade of Homes.
Watch Ron Popeil put chicken & fishes
& burgers & pork & macaroni in the same
box. Hey! I can sell that
box! At school.
Where I smash the gym teacher in his head!
I don't wear my uniform.
I don't clean my locker.
I don't share my lunch with the athletes.

My lunch--mustard.
Straight from the packet.
No one sits next to me.
Keep working my skills.
Keep circling the word blood
in Macbeth.

Good.

It takes days.
It takes days.





[By any measure]
 

By any measure, it was endless
             winter. Emulsions with
Then circled the lake like
This is it. This April will be
Inadequate sensitivity to green. I rose
early, erased for an hour
             Silk-brush and ax
I'd like to think I'm a different person
             latent image fading

around the edges and ears
             Overall a tighter face
now. Is it so hard for you to understand
From the drop-down menu
In a cluster of eight poems, I selected
sleep, but could not
             I decided to change everything
Composed entirely of stills
             or fade into the trees

but could not
             remember the dream
save for one brief shot
of a woman opening her eyes
Ari, pick up. I'm a different person
In a perfect world, this would be
             April, or an associated concept
Green to the touch
             several feet away





Drunk Sonnet 14
 

IF ANYONE KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON EVER THEN HEY
 I AM HERE IT WOULD BE NICE TO TALK SOMETIME
 INFOMERCIALS HAVE STARTED AND I KIND OF WANT TO DIE
 I'M PRETTY SURE THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY FOR A MORGUE
  
 OK SO ACTUALLY IT'S FOR THE BIBLE OR SOMETHING
 SO IT'S A COMMERICAL FOR TRYING TO BE HAPPY OR SOMETHING
 BUT I AM NOT HAPPY TONIGHT NO I AM NOT JUST HERE
 IF HAPPINESS EVER WORKED THEN HOW--I DON'T KNOW
  
 HAPPINESS IS A LIZARD IN THE SUNLIGHT GETTING WARM
 AND THEN IN THE NIGHT BENEATH A ROCK EATING FLIES
 AND SWALLLOWING THE MEAT OF THE TRASH OF THE DIRT
  
 AH, SO TONIGHT IS A LITTLE DRUNK AND OK OK OK
 THAT IS GOOD SO LET ME BE--THERE IS NO LOVE TONIGHT
 GOD IS LIKE BONO--SOME DICKWAD NO ONE WILL EVER MEET OR LIKE





from Spring Psalter
 

Darling, I leave you the forever unblooming
             twig half-sunk in spring mud & the Nature that allows
             such delicate & lasting atrocity.
  
 Darling, darling, darling: my voice is a branch that would reach.
  
 I leave you the ragged sky, once full of cloud & now
             not. I leave you these things just as I leave
  
 you: graceful passage from one something to the next.
             Darling, even in this my voice dissipates
  
 into hush & whiffs of light, sun-thrown, hurtle into the ground.





[jumpsuits]
 

jumpsuits, they have changed
            painting, I
behind the concertina wire
can't look at it anymore, that wall
across which shadows play
Sorry to be vague
            at such an hour. Were you
When I called, I heard
            my voice

anywhere near waking
            in the background
Strange, reversible lines, I thought
he was dead. He is
better of it, pushing the glass
away. How many songs
            can it hold, that thing
I've seen in windows, has it changed
            singing, or

hooded figures
            I didn't know
it had a camera, some features are
The blue of links, obscure
beneath the face, the green
We still don't have a word for
            Simulated drowning in
embedded streams
            a perfect world





Endless Summer
 

 
 . . .
  
 It was the summer I fucked up    the summer    fucked up   me
 fucked up   a fuck-up in the summer   & I spent time laying under stars
 too much   time I wasted  the stars  you lied to me under the stars
 & the summer was endless   the summer endless   it was an endless summer
  
 . . . 
  
 . . . 
  
 endless   & I said things like   "If I ever see you again
 but   I'll never see you again   I never saw you again   I made sure of that
 & I circled   the lake   I went in circles    the lake was endless   it was
 summer   I fucked up   too much time & I never saw   you again   & I
  
 . . . 
  
 . . . 
  
 circled & it was   endless & the stars    lied to me   the summer
 light   moving so slowly   I saw the summer light move   endless
 & when I see you   the trees will cluster   green rage green   trees raging
 with love   endless love & I'll never see you   again   I made sure of that
  
 . . .
  
 . . .
  
 wasted under the stars   the slow summer   light   the endless fuck-up
 & you never again   you lovely   you summer you   everything that is now
 never again   whatever that may be   the rage I loved   me under the stars
 then & now   endless   wasting away me   haze wandering around endless
  
 . . .
  
 . . .
  
 haze  it was endless  too much time & you   lied to me & I    said things like
 I can't describe the air on my skin can you   can you please   I know it was
 important & the light from stars   moved   so slowly   & you   moved off
 forever   how can you save everything   everything   important   endless
  
 . . .
  
 . . .
  
 summer light   the fuck-up   the lake a circle   circling   the lake
 how can you save everything   how can I   answer you the light of summer
 stars I'm sorry  for my light   the endlessness of my endless & my   fuck-up

& then afterward
 


 (i) 
  
 I woke to early sun:
 burning of fire, & then afterward.
  
 We kept reaching
 through the long night.
  
  
 (ii)
  
 Afterward,
  
 the small deceptions
 we allow ourselves:
 a sickness, unchecked.
 Like this:
  
  
 (iii)
  
 & first sunlight.
 Snow continues.
 I could never close my eyes to light.
  
 But there was no light
 & you looked like night. 
  
  
 (iv)
  
 There must be a pattern,
  
 snow slow-dropping in wet clusters
 through the wooden arms
 of empty trees.
  
  
 (v)
  
 Sun fingering its way
 through branches
  
 I'd hung my life on.
 We don't matter a bit; realization
 forces our eyes closed--
  
  
 (vi)
  
 A sickness, unchecked, like this.
 I'd hung my life on
  
 burning of fire, & then afterward.
  
  
 (vii)
  
 Our arms together
 we searched for patterns
  
 & sunlight.
  
  
 (viii)
  
 Our arms laced together,
 pointing together
 over wind-tossed grasses.
  
 Us: waist deep in night blue.
  
  
 (ix)
  
 There was no light.
 You pointed.
  
  
 (x)
  
 Sun overhead,
 you pointed
 to the wind-tossed grasses.
 This is a memory now. 
  
  
 (xi)
  
 Together in that first sun,
 so vivid:
 there must be a pattern
  
 I'd hung my life on.
  
  
 (xii)
  
 Snow dropped in clusters,
 staggered & jagged.
  
 We don't matter a bit.
  
  
 (xiii)
  
 Reflected in lake water:
 all these things I'll forget.
  
  
 (xiv)
  
 Our arms together
  
 but we keep reaching
 over the wind-tossed grasses.
  
  
 (xv)
  
 Black smoke curling:
  
 the importance 
 of night-blue field grass,
  
  
 (xvi)
  
 the importance of.
  
 The stars are close; we try to hold together.
  
  
 (xvii)
  
 All this ends
 but until then:
  
 burning of fire, & then afterward.
 The stars are close; we try to hold.
 Such distance between the fallen!
  
  
 (xviii)
  
 Burning of fire, & then afterward.
  
 You pointed.
  
  
 (xix)
  
 Grasses silently fold,
 a sickness, unchecked, reaching. Like this.
  
 Wooden arms of trees
 long since emptied.
  
  
 (xx)
  
 This ends in darkness,
 & all the stars within reach,
 & other constellations.






The Reservoir
 

1

The reservoir is trying to freeze over
with an expanding map shaped like an angel
Separated lovers on a coast keep walking
toward each other. Low sun reddens 
their faces without heat

They are weary of always moving
so seldom touching, but never think
to move inland, massive and stable
Imagoes hatched on thin ice, it's 
their illusion membranes are brighter
than occluded flesh of interiors

Membranes have the density
of an edge, and edges violent as lava



2

All day she walked across the tundra
He began to drive away obliquely
at exactly her speed, so she altered 
her angle, aiming above him, as in a current

He departed in a zone that solidified 
at his whim, so she reached for his hand
Land cracked with their weight. He seemed
to reach toward her, a hand like paper
twisted and folded over, only a surface
with wan modulations, like a map



3

Then she delicately stepped out
toward the edge, tenuous as a leaf
as if waiting for a letter
but it froze too swiftly before her
At dusk his voice broke her concentration
She turned, vexed, and saw he had not spoken.







Tan Tien
 

As usual, the first gate was modest. It is dilapidated. She can't tell
which bridge crossed the moat, which all cross sand now, disordered with footsteps.
It's a precise overlay of circles on squares, but she has trouble locating
the main avenue and retraces her steps in intense heat for the correct entrance,
which was intentionally blurred, the  way a round arch can give onto a red wall,
far enough in back of the arch for sun to light.

If being by yourself separates from your symmetry, which is
the axis of your spine in the concrete sense, but becomes a suspension
in your spine like a layer of sand under the paving stones of a courtyard
or on a plain, you have to humbly seek out a person who can listen to you,
on a street crowded with bicycles at night, their bells ringing.

And any stick or straight line you hold can be your spine,
like a map she is following in French of Tan Tien. She wants space to fall
to each side of her like traction, not weight dispersed within a mirror. At any time,
an echo of what she says will multiply against the walls in balanced,
dizzying jumps like a gyroscope in the heat, but she is alone. 

Later, she would remember herself as a carved figure and its shadow on a blank board,
but she is her balancing stick, and the ground to each side of her is its length,
disordered once by an armored car, and once by an urn of flowers at a crossing.
The stick isn't really the temple's bisection around her, like solstice or ancestor.
This Tang Dynasty peach tree would be parallel levitation in the spine 
the person recording it.

Slowly the hall looms up. The red stair's outline gives way to its duration
as it extends and rises at a low angle.
In comparison to the family, the individual hardly counts, but they all
wait for her at a teahouse inside the wall.
First the gold knob, then blue tiers above the highest step,
the same color as the sky. 

When one person came to gain confidence,
she imagines he felt symmetry as flight after his fast among seven meteorites
in the dark. He really felt like a globe revolving within a globe.
Even the most singular or indivisible particle or heavenly sphere will adjust
when the axis extending beyond itself is pushed, or the sphere it is within
is pushed. What she thought was her balance flattens into a stylized dragon
on the marble paving stones. 

Yet she's reluctant to leave the compound. Only the emperor
could walk its center line. Now, anyone can imagine how it felt
to bring heaven news. She is trying to remember this in Hong Kong
as the tram pulls suddenly above skyscrapers and the harbor
and she flattens against her seat, like a reversal occurring in the poles,
or what she meant by, no one can imagine how. 







Forms of Politeness
 

1

Taking advantage of the relationships and interaction, which actually exist between what happens 
to her and her desire, she creates some metaphors both obvious and opaque, as screens of rays crisscrossing 
the landscape in which herself and what she expected from you in the way of support coincide,
so that I and you resemble each other, now. The way they light the land like infrared without a trace
on film, really, part of your image was linked so closely to my desire, it remained inside my body.
It never reached the emotions, which tend to damage the body, but which memory requires.
Thus a formal device was discovered for detailing information that was intimate and largely unacceptable 
to what I thought I required from you, regarding beauty in idea and form. She expected distress 
to automatically bring about this beauty, like a woman's theft of fire rope from your house,
but not her hanging in the orchard by the house. She was a stranger to you.
She was never in your consciousness. Hence she was never forgotten.
She is in you the way direct experience generates consciousness, adding the energy of its materialization.  

To live another person's biography is not the same as to live his or her life.
She constructs a story line or cluster of anecdotal details, like clothes around the body,
instruments of both defense and expansion, which give meaning to fluctuations, such as in pleasures
occurring between herself and you. Her sunglasses swathed in feathers express
the contingency of a light and a space, so that the anecdote of a hanging could be utilized
as colorist or combinatory data, instead of her instinct for the imaginary in which what she imagines
represents what happens, whether or not it misrepresents it.

Sometimes it happens during a routine she represents by evenness of light on the land
or when things usually mean nothing, like harmony in light, what happens and something to mean
join accidentally. The thing isn't what it is, but it is like what it is.
Like a fake, it doesn't mean anything, although there is something to mean,
so that her solitude is the guise of unending repetition of a hanging or her relationship with you,
in which all that is to be included will find a place. This is empathy or sharing her intuition with her.
You look into someone's eyes as if you were seeing through the face.



2

Because it's not possible to absorb more than one insight at a time,
there seems to be a contradiction between the visual or space, and the context or meaning.
She felt deep uneasiness with the image of this sunset of unnatural energy, its sinister expression
of an order of impossible beauty we thought we lost, accounting for the intensity of yellow light on the hill,
which is not a thing, and it is not a metaphor, the way your life is not a metaphor to her, or
the way intense light on the hill is a recollection en plein air, in the sense that it happened.
Soon the background turns gray and the hill regains its natural color, but there are three dimensions of gray.
This is a metaphor for the fact that the hanged woman actually made contact with you, although you never knew her.

There is a link with her appearance, as with sex, or the way a name is attached to something
after naming it, by the occurrence of its name, in this case linking with the appearances
or biographies of a whole parade of lovers, so what she thinks of as human help from him 
is no longer dependent on changing her desire for him in the present, but is a substitute for it. 
The landscape is empty and it is immanent. The context of the woman in its reality 
may differ from the context in which the viewer thinks about her, the element of transparency. 
The way the viewer thinks about her is the way low clouds extend a landscape. The viewer 
is acting on the landscape in consideration that the context of the viewer distinct from the context
of general human help could be a metaphor for itself. 

There were yellow-leaved trees behind a screen of green ones at the edge of the orchard.
They are not a border between organization and decay of autumn trees, which are organized.
The yellow leaves around your feet have an impossible beauty that was achieved and then lost. 
A way you can define a woman is to remember everything the woman is not.
If you move your head fast enough, you can all of a sudden discern the whole structure
of the surface of each leaf, and it links in your stomach, as with sex.
If you remember not desiring her fast enough, you can all of a sudden discern her whole body.
You can feel in your stomach the way any moment that happened and in which you think about her goes
a long way toward convincing you of the autonomy and pre-existence of her form.



3

Her concentration became a direct experience of his life, an erotic concentration. 
Her biography of her persistently locates the point of impact of one's own system of representations,
insofar as vision itself is a representative operating on what she sees,
and for which a particular light can represent an initial condition. Even the slightest movement
of a hand or a finger is controlled and emphasized as by a spotlight of this sensitiveness,
the way repetition is a cessation of the potential for conscious experience, or death,
visiting the same places during the same seasons, at almost the same hour,
so that landscape could be a simple repetition, which thrives on reproduction,
in order to resolve what is happening into its own combination or name of words in the form of its time,
and in order to defer the story.

In a way, her memory is a theory about how the hanged woman looked to her in the orchard,
which she has to respect, in the sense that the landscape's immanence is an organically developing
failure of its language to speak its content. The connection between word and idea corresponding
to the landscape is retained, but the connection between the word and the landscape is lost,
so the shadow of a hill stays dark during lightning. How she sees the lightning
is a time lapse into the planar dimension, a hierarchy of grammar or deference
by way of the word belonging to her such as lady suicide or woman suicide,
because the woman doesn't die in her own absence or in effigy, so that
no existing philosophy and no philosopher will know soon, enough points with enough speed
to handle the richness of her reconstruction of her or him for long. He starts to see
patterns in the words and the patterns are pretty to him and distract him.

It is well known that lightning is attracted to body heat, a person on horseback
or a large saguaro, the way a racket of birds in the morning is a kind of empathy for two people.
If we retain the belief that her image of him or her, let's say him, is a pre-requisite for 
gaining consciousness of the unknown person, we suppose there is no direct channel of communication
to the unknown person, with the result that facts about him or her must exit into the world,
before a life can be perceived between the light and dark of function or the object, and desire or the image.
At any time one can turn into its opposite, like desire or a screen, and the object
or her story and him, who does not so much convey an image as a background
to the biography. So, he says, she must emphasize references and conditions of her own life
over its memories, or what she sees of the landscape by the manner of its illumination,
unless she says it is illuminated within the arms of a great cottonwood, yellow or green,
a faith of imaginary or real connotation repeating itself from him, like alternating current
or radioactive dirt being turned up that registers on her without marking her.



4

Her persistent observation, even after the frost, is of each leaf coinciding with its luminousness,
because of its structure as a lighted space and which shows brightness in idea and form,
so you have to maintain your own consciousness in order not to be unconscious with me.
Even if we can uniquely bridge the gap between the fact of a frost and the value
of luminousness, and even though these intrinsic properties of the plant may not be what it feels.
What it feels may be a space with pillars, so with light the space extends, as in what you believe
to live with. A belief is a word-like object. You can focus your attention on it down to a point,
like desire or memory of a strong feeling. You have a certain amount of control over your feeling
about general human help by changing what you believe, which embodies the memories
your speech is empowered to represent, she says.

Space is material, but seems to open up a beyond, which is thought to defy material in its failure
to speak its content. It still cues this content by links or desires, as to a form of physical appearance.
To the extent that she can reconstruct a context or pornography in her body suitable for a hanged woman,
a contingency is beaten back, critically. In the sense that events happening at the same time are
meaningful, but not connected, there are events which mean nothing, though there is something to mean.

This is an easy way to expect with desire from moment to moment, while the woman was hanging herself,
as if consistency and the quest for certainty were not emotional,
as when a person begins telling a story, leaves move.
He believed that when a life is valuable, there is further value when it is responded to
as valuable, but this could occur through evaluative judgement, without his attendant emotion.
The product is in one case consistent manners, in the other, beautiful manners.







Permanent Home
 

1

I seek a permanent home, but this structure has an appearance of indifferent compoundedness and isolation, heading toward hopelessness.

The boy pulls an animal on a leash.

The house with a red roof rests between two hills.

I can look through its windows to the sea.

His aggression opposes what in a domestic animal, cold open space, large enough to work with isolation?

House is the projection, space around it intermediary, theater.

You don't have to consume the space to exist, distance, point-to-point, in which a beloved ruin is middle ground, for example. 



2

First house and space negate one another.

Then, they're a series.

The boy watches a mouse run around the rim of a lampshade.

He relates wanting to catch a mouse with the room, ground.

Wanting a master image obscures ground, like objects in space.

House and space are composite, like my dream, a bubble, lightning, starting point and any second place.



3

Rain pours out a gutter onto the poor horse.

Horse runs under a tin roof supported by poles.

Stockpiles of beams, salvaged wood, brick melt into contextless waste.

I understand the situation by perceiving parts, one after another, then reversing in a glance that removes time. 

So, I can intuit contextless waste as ground. 



4

The water tank sits on a frame of used wood, like a packing crate.

I look through it to an extinct volcano.

The panorama is true figuratively as space, and literally in a glass wall, where clouds appear like flowers, and the back-lit silhouette of a horse passes by.

A file of evergreens secures the cliff amid debris from a crew bilding, as at the edge of the sea.

Oranges, dumplings, boiled eggs take on the opaque energy of a stranger.

Knowledge as lintel, bond beam (model signs) holds the world at a distance.

A master image like bone condenses from the indistinct point-to-point feeling of self with which construction began.

My house returns from outside, as if my spirit had been blocking my path, when I wasn't going anywhere in particular. 



5

Materials and freedom combine, so materials aren't subjective.

The material of space is like having a skeleton to gain a vantage point on seamless distance, as in a comparison.

It's a style of accumulating materials that does not become a solid thing, anymore.

Accommodating a view by being able to be seen through is perceptual, not abstract, like space painted white. 

Give a house the form of an event.

Relate it to something there, a form of compassion.

Your point of view is: it's solid already, so there's warmth.

In this primitive situation, pure form translates a former empire of space as wilderness.

Chinese space breaks free from the view in front of me, while my house continues to rotate on earth. 







[Exordium: In what way names]
 

          
          In what way names were applied to things. Filtration. Not every word that has been applied, still exists. Through proliferation and differentiation. Airborn. Here, this speck and this speck you missed.Numbers in cell division. Spheres of doubt. The paradigm's stitchery of unrelated points. What escapes like so much cotton batting. The building, rather, in flames. Does flight happen in an order. Dates to impugn and divluge. The laws were written on twelve tablets of bronze which were fastened to the rostra. Trembling hold. Manner of variation and shift. Vacillation hung by tactile and auditory cues.

First Circle
 

It's dark in here, the dark inside of a man
in the dark. It's not night. One hears crows
overhead, dawn fowl caws, the shod soles again

treading their sunlit plots above. One grows
dotish-fond of such things. Long live the things,
their ways, their roots pushed goatish & gray

through the skull, in this earth that gaily spins
though one has crossed its smutted green threshold
to reign in a crate. We have done no wrong,

my friends, & yet we find ourselves soiled,
sold, carbonized teeth in a moss-riven jaw.
Once I sat on a stool as my grandmother told

me of heaven. She cleaned fish for our living. I saw
how her rusty black knife unseamed the sunset
in each belly--coral, ochre, carmine, raw,

lice-infested sunsets in a pail. So many nights. 
Night in the kitchen shack, night at the crumbling edge
of our milk-pond province, a blade, lone cricket

raving in the lawn.





Inner Life
 

The bear stopped dancing & unscrewed his head.
He held it upside-down in the dusk. She reached
into her pouch for a copper piece, but instead
pulled out the silvery piece she'd been saving

for some special occasion. A limited issue,
stamped on one side with a profile of the prince;
on the other side a water wheel did not spin.
It glowed in her hand. Her hand grew heavy with it,

& the salts, & the bittersome oils of her hand.
Was this the occasion? The others were there
with their fists in their pouches & the weary bear
held out his head as if it were an offering

or an object lesson. It was neither. It was ripped,
with russet handfuls of animals' hair pasted on
& a secret eye slit recessed in its open maw.
The wild old man in the bear suit parted his lips

& out came a snatch of extinct birdsong.
The musicians clapped. He'd learned it as a boy
growing up in the mist-proud interior
where he would call & call until the violet males

in a frenzy swooped into his breathtaking nets. 







Monsoon Eclogue
 

Some years ago a procession 
of men calling themselves
the sky-clad came
to this district to build
a hospital for birds that had been
damaged by the rains.

The landholders here
my grandfather among them
decided against it--
it not being our way
to intervene with monsoons

which is why to this day
the birds here grow
so damaged & wise,

or so our tutor said gravely

before stepping out into the sun-
washed coriander patch to watch
droplets work down
stems one by one, small
storms suspended, while over
the rooftiles came
breakers of mist making
our whole house to him
drift back like the high prow
of the viceroy's steamship
he watched sail off with his youth.

Inside I still could not find
the main verb the chariot
wheel performed. I thought

it was silver. It bore

the king with 100 heads
across a battlefield red
with his wounded 
up to the end of the
beginner's workbook

then blue-skinned Rama bent his bow then his
raider's arrow met
the axle & then

I could not stop laughing

as through the doorway my mother scolded
the aphasic houseboy

who peed into our
green watertank
(black putti, untouchable)
arcing the thin golden
stream & singing
ooo-ee ooo-ee at our ruin.







Rehab
 

We wear harnesses like crossing guards. 
In a pouch over the heart, 
over stent and bypass, a black 
box with leads pressed onto metal 
nipples. We pedal and tread and row 
while our signals are picked up
by antennas on the ceiling, X's 
like the eyes cartoonists give the dead.

Angels of telemetry with vials of nitro 
watch over us. We beam to their monitors 
now a barn dance, now a moonwalk. 
They cuff us and pump and we keep on 
so tomorrow will live off today. Nurse, 
we won't forget the animated 
video of our cholesterol highway 
where LDL, black-hatted scowling 
donut holes on wheels, blocked traffic.

But with muscles like gutta-percha, 
can we leave time's gurney in the dust? 
By now only the dead know more about 
gravity than we do. In reply, a tape 
of Little Richard or Jerry Lee comes on 
and we're singing, aloud or not, all 
pale infarcted pedalers, rowers, treadmillers, 
and our hearts are rising in the east.





The Metal and the Flower
 

Intractable between them grows
a garden of barbed wire and roses.
Burning briars like flames devour
their too innocent attire.
Dare they meet, the blackened wire
tears the intervening air.

Trespassers have wandered through
texture of flesh and petals.
Dogs like arrows moved along
pathways that their noses knew.
While the two who laid it out
find the metal and the flower
fatal underfoot.

Black and white at midnight glows
this garden of barbed wire and roses.
Doused with darkness roses burn
coolly as a rainy moon:
beneath a rainy moon or none
silver the sheath on barb and thorn.

Change the garden, scale and plan;
wall it, make it annual.
There the briary flower grew.
There the brambled wire ran.
While they sleep the garden grows, 
deepest wish annuls the will:
perfect still the wire and rose.







Oration: Half-Moon in Vermont
 

A horse is shivering flies off its ribs, grazing
Through the stench of a sodden leachfield.

On the broken stairs of a trailer
A laughing fat girl in a T-shirt is pumping
Milk from her swollen breasts, cats
Lapping at the trails. There's a sheen of rhubarb
On her dead fingernail. It's a humid morning.

Tonight, with the moon washing some stars away,
She'll go searching for an old bicycle in the shed;
She'll find his father's treasures:
Jars full of bent nails, a lacquered bass,
And the scythe with spiders
Nesting in the emptiness of the blade
And in the bow of its pine shaft.
Milling junk in the dark,

She'll forget the bicycle, her getaway,
And rescue
A color photograph of an old matinee idol.
Leaving the shed, she'll startle

An owl out on the marsh. By November
It will be nailed through the breast to the barn.

In a year the owl will go on a shelf in the shed
Where in thirty years there will be a music box
Containing a lock of hair, her rosaries,
Her birth certificate,

And an impossibly sheer, salmon-pink scarf. What
I want to know of my government is

Doesn't poverty just fucking break your heart?





Let the Light Enter
 

    The Dying Words of Goethe
"Light! more light! the shadows deepen,
         And my life is ebbing low,
 Throw the windows widely open:
         Light! more light! before I go.
  
 "Softly let the balmy sunshine
         Play around my dying bed,
 E'er the dimly lighted valley
         I with lonely feet must tread.
  
 "Light! more light! for Death is weaving
         Shadows round my waning sight,
 And I fain would gaze upon him
         Through a stream of earthly light.
  
 Not for greater gifts of genius;
         Not for thoughts more grandly bright,
 All the dying poet whispers
         Is a prayer for light, more light.
  
 Heeds he not the gathered laurels,
         Fading slowly from his sight;
 All the poet's aspirations
         Centre in that prayer for light.
  
 Gracious Saviour, when life's day-dreams
         Melt and vanish from the sight,
 May our dim and longing vision
         Then be blessed with light, more light.





Early Affection
 

I lov'd thee from the earliest dawn,
      When first I saw thy beauty's ray,
 And will, until life's eve comes on,
      And beauty's blossom fades away;
 And when all things go well with thee,
 With smiles and tears remember me.
  
 I'll love thee when thy morn is past,
      And wheedling gallantry is o'er,
 When youth is lost in age's blast,
      And beauty can ascend no more,
 And when life's journey ends with thee,
 O, then look back and think of me.
  
 I'll love thee with a smile or frown,
      'Mid sorrow's gloom or pleasure's light,
 And when the chain of life runs down,
      Pursue thy last eternal flight,
 When thou hast spread thy wing to flee,
 Still, still, a moment wait for me.
  
 I'll love thee for those sparkling eyes,
      To which my fondness was betray'd,
 Bearing the tincture of the skies,
      To glow when other beauties fade,
 And when they sink too low to see,
 Reflect an azure beam on me. 






Thou Art My Lute
 

Thou art my lute, by thee I sing,--
      My being is attuned to thee.
 Thou settest all my words a-wing,
      And meltest me to melody.
  
 Thou art my life, by thee I live,
      From thee proceed the joys I know;
 Sweetheart, thy hand has power to give
      The meed of love--the cup of woe.
  
 Thou art my love, by thee I lead
      My soul the paths of light along,
 From vale to vale, from mead to mead,
      And home it in the hills of song.
  
 My song, my soul, my life, my all,
      Why need I pray or make my plea,
 Since my petition cannot fall;
      For I'm already one with thee!





Snowy Owl Near Ocean Shores
 

A castaway blown south from the arctic tundra
sits on a stump in an abandoned farmer's field.
Beyond the dunes cattails toss and bend as snappy
as the surf, rushing and crashing down the jetty.

His head a swivel of round glances,
his eyes a deeper yellow than the winter sun,
he wonders if the spot two hundred feet away
is a mouse on the crawl from mud hole
to deer-grass patch.

An hour of wind and sleet whips the air,
nothing darts or passes but the river underground.
A North Pole creature shows us how to last.
The wind ruffles his feathers from crown to claw

while he gazes into zeroes the salt-slick rain.
As a double-rainbow before us arcs
sky and owl, we leave him surrendering
to the echo of his white refrain.





Soul Story
 

Who is quitting dogs today? Making them their sister?
Who is stretched out by a lamppost sibling? Illuminated by ransom's note?

I was oblivious to pettiness until I saw its first handle: obey ignorance.
Stomach decisiveness. By that, this decision . . . no decision.

Let it be to gain all it can in one fetter . . . but if it be life,
let it attempt a failed recognition.

Let its thinker be the failure. My thinker is failure,
and I want to teach it how to move in this world.

Do you be or live?
To any the other wants.

To both these words, I fail to be.
When I am, but when not . . .

It is, as if alive.





Mirror Meteor
 

Pixie-dust infusion
shoots steady shock through incline--
is that crooked
or slyster meat tong, grabbing hold of night
so as not to pulse so bright past outcome

Pardon the excess--it's a point to make
that out of all this dirt
comes glass or shiny sheen
meant to gloss
over rough spots--let's moan and breathe

At one time, so that anything shattered
will sound pretty
I need to show how I love--sound and vision
if I sing and move to what I hear
and feel, just for you

Well, let's see if we can match
our limbs to the credible--or maybe the possible
let's play again, so that
you know what you're in for,
when you save your last dance for glass

How clutterdust of me--
and here's where I lose
my head over a star system,
a horny section
ten thousand years older than me






Merely a Poet
 

THAT ONE, is a poet for all poets
AH, then I would suppose
to be an edwin for all edwins
OH, then there is only one of you
you are being one for
AH, I am one of me
but one is too many for all
OH, then how can this one be for all
when that one is truly for truly's sake
Which one?
It isn't a which or a what but a be
HMMPF, an ending for all endings
UMMPF, to be a poet for poets
is a mere suppose
BLECHH, you covered suppose in an earlier poem
YUCHH, but no one heard it
ARGH, they say a poem is heard when it is written
ERGH, then I have heard my entire life
as it happens
HOOOPHA, a mere one, an entire suppose,
this has been . . .
WAIT, are you implying an ending?
AHA, a being
OHO, now there is a poem
OOOOH, an ending
AHHHH, where there are so many to choose from





Oh Yeah and the Eye Stays Open
 

taking in what it hears
surprised at the way of path
the laid down before
the adventured after

smiling grip on what you want
would never let me down
I know you we say
after never having met

how listening to the other side
makes you wish for quiet
miles of ocean
beneath this rock

go on let your hair down
such subtle indignity
a sunset against a moon
looking for a way out

but I won't say anything
won't call you on your everything
you where you are and me right here
saying yeah with a shut mouth





Dyspnea
 

For days to situate the flesh in whose inadequate precinct
motionless: a monolith of the often spoken
of which nothing is

certain: or abstract of whose gender to the use
of all acknowledged desire formal
parlance & pronoun

to form the stars across your back: whose hardened
muscle: tremendous lateral delta
of which to the shoulders:

there is a way from yes: the very inside an eternal
tick of the left eye: a language
not only illegible as

the vain translation of a fictive contradictory
self & its consonant verb to be:
but the body's crystal

falling through a grey film of failed memory
& brushfire this Autumn midnight:
to unfold (in the form

of your body) pleasured corners of a place
in which the difficult new breathing
and I are foreigners





Itinerary
 

for E. A.
Vulnerable therein & perfectly
relinquished by statis,

object always of my
natal, crepuscular desire,

into the translucent specter,
body's blue fossil

of ice, never autochthonous,
still embarked upon

the imperative passage to get
there, to secure a geography

that will beg description,
narrative map, adopted

tentatively; if only to write
the ritual book of what was possible,

but never bound to occur.





Genesis: The Resilient Colors
 

And surfaced a flame in the dark elsewhere
of one remembered form: just one,
suppose it the flesh of unspecified man
a mouth down deeper between my legs
his heavy beard in the beginning
against these wet thighs our bodies scribbled
in signs to draw the grey curtain of steam back
by which we found ourselves surrounded
sound of water off the tile (or on this sheet
of paper stammering) by which we came to nestle
a will from which the colors rose resilient
sparks of orange over the waves of trickled
hair on chest and forearm light
green to trace the conduits formed by
vein of biceps and prick the pink
ridges of his brown nipples in brackets raised
this tongue in blue translucent embers
to emanate where a moon of fingers along
the dark red notch of earth is a field
over which armies raged with catapults of burning
stones until all was left there smoldering below.






Catch
 

if this is a game then we have made it, unknowing,
to the final four. unlikely underdogs. spectators turned
to suspect sport. anti-athletes. out of shape beyond reason.

at season's height we fight for a limited audience. few dancers.
fewer cheers. down by 30 and our coach m.i.a. we, foolish, dribble.
each bounce-back brings a stranger. can't call us for traveling because

we ain't going nowhere. instead, we trade terrified looks. search
for the pass but no one stays open for long. even if we knew what to do
to pull this through we've got two other teams waiting, impatient, to take us out.







When the saints went
 

what remained: barren stalks bowing heads
by the field-full. rusty air conditioners dripping
from warped windowsills. rock formations retaining roots.

hollowed out caves and dog stumps forced ragged, toothy grins.
all ablaze. a laser show shot hot through the tinny night. every husk
wore a well lit protrusion. every breath an asthmatic thrush more material

than the silence that surrounds each carcass now: voided prayer: cold
arthritic grating: remembering notions of breath. saints: offer a hand to a 
wheezing shadow: wish for someone to hold before the sure, sudden twilight.






Waiting on the Reading
 

Many of my race have lived long without the touch of
these fine things which separate us from beasts. Things
I call my own now. Having served thirty-six years as needleman

for a family far more ape than we will ever be, I rode
the moonlight train to find my free. Up here it is colder than I like,
but the gentlemen admire my frock coats above all. I taught my son this trade

and hope this picture I made will help retrieve him. Come summer I leave
this coast for Philadelphia where I hear we of color can breathe yet more free.
Tonight I stitch. The breeze off the bay smells of aria. It is almost the season for cloaks.





The Trumpet
 

Rise up, rise up,
And, as the trumpet blowing
Chases the dreams of men,
As the dawn glowing
The stars that left unlit
The land and water,
Rise up and scatter
The dew that covers
The print of last night's lovers--
Scatter it, scatter it!

While you are listening
To the clear horn,
Forget, men, everything
On this earth newborn,
Except that it is lovelier
Than any mysteries.
Open your eyes to the air
That has washed the eyes of the stars
Through all the dewy night:
Up with the light,
To the old wars;
Arise, arise!





Castro Moves Into the Havana Hilton
 

"History always dresses us for the wrong occasions.--Ricardo Pau-Llosa

Camera Obscura

The afternoon lightening his shadow,
Fidel descends from the mountains,
the clean-shaven lawyer turned guerilla,
his eyes focused on infinity,
El Jefe Mximo con sus Barbudos,
rebels with rosary beads
on their 600-mile procession across the island
with campesinos on horseback, flatbed trucks, tanks,
a new year's journey down the oldest roads
towards betrayal.

Ambient light. Available light

Light inside of them,
nameless isleos line El Malecn to touch Fidel,
already defining himself in black and white.
The dramatic sky moving in for the close-up
that will frame his all-night oratory,
he turns to the crowd,
variations on an enigma,
waving from his pulpit with rehearsed eloquence,
a dove on his shoulder.

This is a photograph. This is not a sign.

Flash-on camera. Celebrity portraits.

          1.     Fidel on a balcony across the street
                  from Grand Central Station,
                  an American flag above his head,
                  New York, 1959.

          2.     Fidel made small by the Lincoln Memorial,
                  Washington D.C., 1959.

          3.     Fidel learning to ski,
                  a minor black ball against a white landscape,
                  Russia, 1962.

          4.     Fidel and shotgun,
                  hunting with Nikita,
                  Russia, 1962.

Circles of Confusion

Beyond photographs,
Havana is looted and burned.
Women weep at out wailing wall,
El Paredn, where traitors are taken,
and television cameras shoot
the executions, this blood soup,
the paradoxes of our lives,
three years before I am born.

Photoflood

But it is late afternoon,
and a shower of confetti and serpentine
falls from every floor of the Havana Hilton,
where history is a giant piata,
where at midnight, Fidel will be photographed
eating a ham sandwich.






Christmas, 1970
 

We assemble the silver tree,
our translated lives,
its luminous branches,
numbered to fit into its body.
place its metallic roots
to decorate our first Christmas.
Mother finds herself
opening, closing the Red Cross box
she will carry into 1976
like an unwanted door prize,
a timepiece, a stubborn fact,
an emblem of exile measuring our days,
marked by the moment of our departure,
our lives no longer arranged.

Somewhere,
there is a photograph,
a Polaroid Mother cannot remember was ever taken:
I am sitting under Tia Tere's Christmas tree,
her first apartment in this, our new world:
my sisters by my side,
I wear a white dress, black boots,
an eight-year-old's resignation;
Mae and Mitzy, age four,
wear red and white snowflake sweaters and identical smiles,
on this, our first Christmas,
away from ourselves.

The future unreal, unmade,
Mother will cry into the new year
with Lidia and Emerito,
our elderly downstairs neighbors,
who realize what we are too young to understand:
Even a map cannot show you
the way back to a place
that no longer exists.






Harina de Castilla
 

"All accounts of the past are made up of possibilities.--Dionisio Martinezfor Larry Villanueva

i.
For years,
you were a story of ancestors,
pre-revolutionary Cuba:
Barrios, Donate, Gallata, Villanueva,
family names strung and pearled in the Caribbean
by blood and memory,
nostalgia and calamity
en Artemisa, a small town in my mother's childhood,
a woman in December of 1967,
your Ta Marta, a hospital room en la Covadonga,
rows and rows of children, my sisters,
unexpectedly two, your cousins,
whose clothes Mae and Mitzy wore
into history and exile.

En el exilo, La Cuba del Norte,
ten years after the summer of El Mariel,
you were my map of Cuba,
un espejo, un reflejo,
a tisa-blue knot of possibility.
Mi esquina Habanera,
a street en la arquitectura del pasado,
a superficial distance in the patina of memory,
a me I had never really known,
a language I had learned not to think in.

Later, you were a face on T.V.
en Guadalupe, Mara Elena,
my mother's telenovelas en el canal 23,
an actor, a director, a sculptor, abstract angst with a face
history and coincidence had given me.

ii.
So when you become fingerprints and words,
a noun, a verb, a snapshot in motion,
I am no longer alone with my ghosts,
las sombras de el pasado, inventing truth,
reclaiming language, my old self.
I am me, unadorned by speech,
English or translation;
I am an I, simple, exposed,
this afternoon in our lives,
a conversation about the circle
of coincidence and persuasion,
a photograph of an idea we once were,
and you are familiar,
somehow.

iii.
Constantly returning,
we breathe in Spanish,
move through blank spaces like incantations,
waiting for words to fill a moment
(often ninety miles long)
with etymology, jargon, ghostwords,
shadows and nostalgia,
and become Harina de Castilla, Larry,
re-shaped, translated, improvised, sculpted
and redefined.






The Sign-Post
 

The dim sea glints chill. The white sun is shy,
And the skeleton weeds and the never-dry,
Rough, long grasses keep white with frost
At the hilltop by the finger-post;
The smoke of the traveller's-joy is puffed
Over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft.
I read the sign. Which way shall I go?
A voice says: You would not have doubted so
At twenty. Another voice gentle with scorn
Says: At twenty you wished you had never been born.

One hazel lost a leaf of gold
From a tuft at the tip, when the first voice told
The other he wished to know what 'twould be
To be sixty by this same post. "You shall see,
He laughed--and I had to join his laughter-- 
"You shall see; but either before or after,
Whatever happens, it must befall,
A mouthful of earth to remedy all
Regrets and wishes shall freely be given;
And if there be a flaw in that heaven
'Twill be freedom to wish, and your wish may be
To be here or anywhere talking to me,
No matter what the weather, on earth,
At any age between death and birth,
To see what day or night can be,
The sun and the frost, the land and the sea,
Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring,-- 
With a poor man of any sort, down to a king,
Standing upright out in the air
Wondering where he shall journey, O where?





Adlestrop
 

Yes. I remember Adlestrop--
The name, because one afternoon
Of heat the express-train drew up there
Unwontedly. It was late June.

The steam hissed. Someone cleared his throat.
No one left and no one came
On the bare platform. What I saw
Was Adlestrop--only the name

And willows, willow-herb, and grass,
And meadowsweet, and haycocks dry,
No whit less still and lonely fair
Than the high cloudlets in the sky.

And for that minute a blackbird sang
Close by, and round him, mistier,
Farther and farther, all the birds
Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire.





Lob
 

At hawthorn-time in Wiltshire travelling
In search of something chance would never bring,
An old man's face, by life and weather cut
And coloured,--rough, brown, sweet as any nut,--
A land face, sea-blue-eyed,--hung in my mind
When I had left him many a mile behind.
All he said was: "Nobody can't stop 'ee. It's
A footpath, right enough. You see those bits
Of mounds--that's where they opened up the barrows
Sixty years since, while I was scaring sparrows.
They thought as there was something to find there,
But couldn't find it, by digging, anywhere.

To turn back then and seek him, where was the use?
There were three Manningfords,--Abbots, Bohun, and Bruce:
And whether Alton, not Manningford, it was,
My memory could not decide, because
There was both Alton Barnes and Alton Priors.
All had their churches, graveyards, farms, and byres,
Lurking to one side up the paths and lanes,
Seldom well seen except by aeroplanes;
And when bells rang, or pigs squealed, or cocks crowed,
Then only heard. Ages ago the road
Approached. The people stood and looked and turned.
Nor asked it to come nearer, nor yet learned
To move out there and dwell in all men's dust.
And yet withal they shot the weathercock, just
Because 'twas he crowed out of tune, they said:
So now the copper weathercock is dead.
If they had reaped their dandelions and sold
Them fairly, they could have afforded gold.

Many years passed, and I went back again
Among those villages, and looked for men
Who might have known my ancient. He himself
Had long been dead or laid upon the shelf,
I thought. One man I asked about him roared
At my description: "'Tis old Bottlesford
He means, Bill. But another said: "Of course,
It was Jack Button up at the White Horse.
He's dead, sir, these three years. This lasted till
A girl proposed Walker of Walker's Hill,
"Old Adam Walker. Adam's Point you'll see
Marked on the maps.

                                 "That was her roguery,
The next man said. He was a squire's son
Who loved wild bird and beast, and dog and gun
For killing them. He had loved them from his birth,
One with another, as he loved the earth.
"The man may be like Button, or Walker, or
Like Bottlesford, that you want, but far more
He sounds like one I saw when I was a child.
I could almost swear to him. The man was wild
And wandered. His home was where he was free.
Everybody has met one such man as he.
Does he keep clear old paths that no one uses
But once a lifetime when he loves or muses?
He is English as this gate, these flowers, this mire.
And when at eight years old Lob-lie-by-the-fire
Came in my books, this was the man I saw.
He has been in England as long as dove and daw,
Calling the wild cherry tree the merry tree,
The rose campion Bridget-in-her-bravery;
And in a tender mood he, as I guess,
Christened one flower Love-in-idleness,
And while he walked from Exeter to Leeds
One April called all cuckoo-flowers Milkmaids.
From him old herbal Gerard learnt, as a boy,
To name wild clematis the Traveller's-joy.
Our blackbirds sang no English till his ear
Told him they called his Jan Toy Pretty dear.'
(She was Jan Toy the Lucky, who, having lost
A shilling, and found a penny loaf, rejoiced.)
For reasons of his own to him the wren
Is Jenny Pooter. Before all other men
'Twas he first called the Hog's Back the Hog's Back.
That Mother Dunch's Buttocks should not lack
Their name was his care. He too could explain
Totteridge and Totterdown and Juggler's Lane:
He knows, if anyone. Why Tumbling Bay,
Inland in Kent, is called so, he might say.
"But little he says compared with what he does.
If ever a sage troubles him he will buzz
Like a beehive to conclude the tedious fray:
And the sage, who knows all languages, runs away.
Yet Lob has thirteen hundred names for a fool,
And though he never could spare time for school
To unteach what the fox so well expressed,
On biting the cock's head off,--Quietness is best,--
He can talk quite as well as anyone
After his thinking is forgot and done.
He first of all told someone else's wife,
For a farthing she'd skin a flint and spoil a knife
Worth sixpence skinning it. She heard him speak:
She had a face as long as a wet week'
Said he, telling the tale in after years.
With blue smock and with gold rings in his ears,
Sometimes he is a pedlar, not too poor
To keep his wit. This is tall Tom that bore
The logs in, and with Shakespeare in the hall
Once talked, when icicles hung by the wall.
As Herne the Hunter he has known hard times.
On sleepless nights he made up weather rhymes
Which others spoilt. And, Hob being then his name,
He kept the hog that thought the butcher came
To bring his breakfast You thought wrong,' said Hob.
When there were kings in Kent this very Lob,
Whose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merry,
Wedded the king's daughter of Canterbury;
For he alone, unlike squire, lord, and king,
Watched a night by her without slumbering;
He kept both waking. When he was but a lad
He won a rich man's heiress, deaf, dumb, and sad,
By rousing her to laugh at him. He carried
His donkey on his back. So they were married.
And while he was a little cobbler's boy
He tricked the giant coming to destroy
Shrewsbury by flood. And how far is it yet?'
The giant asked in passing. I forget;
But see these shoes Ive worn out on the road
And we're not there yet.' He emptied out his load
Of shoes for mending. The giant let fall from his spade
The earth for damming Severn, and thus made
The Wrekin hill; and little Ercall hill
Rose where the giant scraped his boots. While still
So young, our Jack was chief of Gotham's sages.
But long before he could have been wise, ages
Earlier than this, while he grew thick and strong
And ate his bacon, or, at times, sang a song
And merely smelt it, as Jack the giant-killer
He made a name. He too ground up the miller,
The Yorkshireman who ground men's bones for flour.

"Do you believe Jack dead before his hour?
Or that his name is Walker, or Bottlesford,
Or Button, a mere clown, or squire, or lord?
The man you saw,--Lob-lie-by-the-fire, Jack Cade,
Jack Smith, Jack Moon, poor Jack of every trade,
Young Jack, or old Jack, or Jack What-d'ye-call,
Jack-in-the-hedge, or Robin-run-by-the-wall,
Robin Hood, Ragged Robin, lazy Bob,
One of the lords of No Man's Land, good Lob,--
Although he was seen dying at Waterloo,
Hastings, Agincourt, and Sedgemoor too,--
Lives yet. He never will admit he is dead
Till millers cease to grind men's bones for bread,
Not till our weathercock crows once again
And I remove my house out of the lane
On to the road. With this he disappeared
In hazel and thorn tangled with old-man's-beard.
But one glimpse of his back, as there he stood,
Choosing his way, proved him of old Jack's blood,
Young Jack perhaps, and now a Wiltshireman
As he has oft been since his days began.






Haymaking
 

Aftear night's thunder far away had rolled
The fiery day had a kernel sweet of cold,
And in the perfect blue the clouds uncurled,
Like the first gods before they made the world
And misery, swimming the stormless sea
In beauty and in divine gaiety.
The smooth white empty road was lightly strewn
With leaves--the holly's Autumn falls in June--
And fir cones standing stiff up in the heat.
The mill-foot water tumbled white and lit
With tossing crystals, happier than any crowd
Of children pouring out of school aloud.
And in the little thickets where a sleeper
For ever might lie lost, the nettle-creeper
And garden warbler sang unceasingly;
While over them shrill shrieked in his fierce glee
The swift with wings and tail as sharp and narrow
As if the bow had flown off with the arrow.
Only the scent of woodbine and hay new-mown
Travelled the road. In the field sloping down,
Park-like, to where its willows showed the brook,
Haymakers rested. The tosser lay forsook
Out in the sun; and the long waggon stood
Without its team, it seemed it never would
Move from the shadow of that single yew.
The team, as still, until their task was due,
Beside the labourers enjoyed the shade
That three squat oaks mid-field together made
Upon a circle of grass and weed uncut,
And on the hollow, once a chalk-pit, but
Now brimmed with nut and elder-flower so clean.
The men leaned on their rakes, about to begin,
But still. And all were silent. All was old,
This morning time, with a great age untold,
Older than Clare and Cobbett, Morland and Crome,
Than, at the field's far edge, the farmer's home,
A white house crouched at the foot of a great tree.
Under the heavens that know not what years be
The men, the beasts, the trees, the implements
Uttered even what they will in times far hence--
All of us gone out of the reach of change--
Immortal in a picture of an old grange.





Gone, Gone Again
 

Gone, gone again,
May, June, July,
And August gone,
Again gone by,

Not memorable
Save that I saw them go,
As past the empty quays
The rivers flow.

And now again,
In the harvest rain,
The Blenheim oranges
Fall grubby from the trees,

As when I was young--
And when the lost one was here--
And when the war began
To turn young men to dung.

Look at the old house,
Outmoded, dignified,
Dark and untenanted,
With grass growing instead

Of the footsteps of life,
The friendliness, the strife;
In its beds have lain
Youth, love, age, and pain:

I am something like that;
Only I am not dead,
Still breathing and interested
In the house that is not dark:--

I am something like that:
Not one pane to reflect the sun,
For the schoolboys to throw at--
They have broken every one.





The Child on the Cliffs
 

Mother, the root of this little yellow flower
Among the stones has the taste of quinine.
Things are strange to-day on the cliff. The sun shines so bright,
And the grasshopper works at his sewing-machine
So hard. Here's one on my hand, mother, look;
I lie so still. There's one on your book.

But I have something to tell more strange. So leave
Your book to the grasshopper, mother dear,--
Like a green knight in a dazzling market-place,--
And listen now. Can you hear what I hear
Far out? Now and then the foam there curls
And stretches a white arm out like a girl's.

Fishes and gulls ring no bells. There cannot be
A chapel or church between here and Devon,
With fishes or gulls ringing its bell,--hark!--
Somewhere under the sea or up in heaven.
"It's the bell, my son, out in the bay
On the buoy. It does sound sweet to-day.

Sweeter I never heard, mother, no, not in all Wales.
I should like to be lying under that foam,
Dead, but able to hear the sound of the bell,
And certain that you would often come
And rest, listening happily.
I should be happy if that could be.






The Brook
 

Seated once by a brook, watching a child
Chiefly that paddled, I was thus beguiled.
Mellow the blackbird sang and sharp the thrush
Not far off in the oak and hazel brush,
Unseen. There was a scent like honeycomb
From mugwort dull. And down upon the dome
Of the stone the cart-horse kicks against so oft
A butterfly alighted. From aloft
He took the heat of the sun, and from below.
On the hot stone he perched contented so,
As if never a cart would pass again
That way; as if I were the last of men
And he the first of insects to have earth
And sun together and to know their worth.
I was divided between him and the gleam,
The motion, and the voices, of the stream,
The waters running frizzled over gravel,
That never vanish and for ever travel.
A grey flycatcher silent on a fence
And I sat as if we had been there since
The horseman and the horse lying beneath
The fir-tree-covered barrow on the heath,
The horseman and the horse with silver shoes,
Galloped the downs last. All that I could lose
I lost. And then the child's voice raised the dead.
"No one's been here before was what she said
And what I felt, yet never should have found
A word for, while I gathered sight and sound.





The Other
 

The forest ended. Glad I was
To feel the light, and hear the hum
Of bees, and smell the drying grass
And the sweet mint, because I had come
To an end of forest, and because
Here was both road and inn, the sum
Of what's not forest. But 'twas here
They asked me if I did not pass
Yesterday this way? "Not you? Queer.
"Who then? and slept here? I felt fear.

I learnt his road and, ere they were
Sure I was I, left the dark wood
Behind, kestrel and woodpecker,
The inn in the sun, the happy mood
When first I tasted sunlight there.
I travelled fast, in hopes I should
Outrun that other. What to do
When caught, I planned not. I pursued
To prove the likeness, and, if true,
To watch until myself I knew.

I tried the inns that evening
Of a long gabled high-street grey,
Of courts and outskirts, travelling
An eager but a weary way,
In vain. He was not there. Nothing
Told me that ever till that day
Had one like me entered those doors,
Save once. That time I dared: "You may
Recall--but never-foamless shores
Make better friends than those dull boors.

Many and many a day like this
Aimed at the unseen moving goal
And nothing found but remedies
For all desire. These made not whole;
They sowed a new desire, to kiss
Desire's self beyond control,
Desire of desire. And yet
Life stayed on within my soul.
One night in sheltering from the wet
I quite forgot I could forget.

A customer, then the landlady
Stared at me. With a kind of smile
They hesitated awkwardly:
Their silence gave me time for guile.
Had anyone called there like me,
I asked. It was quite plain the wile
Succeeded. For they poured out all.
And that was naught. Less than a mile
Beyond the inn, I could recall
He was like me in general.

He had pleased them, but I less.
I was more eager than before
To find him out and to confess,
To bore him and to let him bore.
I could not wait: children might guess
I had a purpose, something more
That made an answer indiscreet.
One girl's caution made me sore,
Too indignant even to greet
That other had we chanced to meet.

I sought then in solitude.
The wind had fallen with the night; as still
The roads lay as the ploughland rude,
Dark and naked, on the hill.
Had there been ever any feud
'Twixt earth and sky, a mighty will
Closed it: the crocketed dark trees,
A dark house, dark impossible
Cloud-towers, one star, one lamp, one peace
Held on an everlasting lease:

And all was earth's, or all was sky's;
No difference endured between
The two. A dog barked on a hidden rise;
A marshbird whistled high unseen;
The latest waking blackbird's cries
Perished upon the silence keen.
The last light filled a narrow firth
Among the clouds. I stood serene,
And with a solemn quiet mirth,
An old inhabitant of earth.

Once the name I gave to hours
Like this was melancholy, when
It was not happiness and powers
Coming like exiles home again,
And weaknesses quitting their bowers,
Smiled and enjoyed, far off from men,
Moments of everlastingness.
And fortunate my search was then
While what I sought, nevertheless,
That I was seeking, I did not guess.

That time was brief: once more at inn
And upon road I sought my man
Till once amid a tap-room's din
Loudly he asked for me, began
To speak, as if it had been a sin,
Of how I thought and dreamed and ran
After him thus, day after day:
He lived as one under a ban
For this: what had I got to say?
I said nothing, I slipped away.

And now I dare not follow after
Too close. I try to keep in sight,
Dreading his frown and worse his laughter.
I steal out of the wood to light;
I see the swift shoot from the rafter
By the inn door: ere I alight
I wait and hear the starlings wheeze
And nibble like ducks: I wait his flight.
He goes: I follow: no release
Until he ceases. Then I also shall cease.





House and Man
 

One hour: as dim he and his house now look
As a reflection in a rippling brook,
While I remember him; but first, his house.
Empty it sounded. It was dark with forest boughs
That brushed the walls and made the mossy tiles
Part of the squirrels' track. In all those miles
Of forest silence and forest murmur, only
One house--"Lonely! he said, "I wish it were lonely--
Which the trees looked upon from every side,
And that was his.

                          He waved good-bye to hide
A sigh that he converted to a laugh.
He seemed to hang rather than stand there, half
Ghost-like, half like a beggar's rag, clean wrung
And useless on the brier where it has hung
Long years a-washing by sun and wind and rain.

But why I call back man and house again
Is that now on a beech-tree's tip I see
As then I saw--I at the gate, and he
In the house darkness,--a magpie veering about,
A magpie like a weathercock in doubt.






Painting A Wave
 

"Painting a wave requires no system,
The painter said, painting a wave.
"Systems may get you flotsam and jetsam,
Seaweed and so forth. But never a wave.

There was a scroll or fine-lined curve
On the canvas first, and then what looked
Like hair flying or grayish nerves,
Which began to move as the painter worked.

"Painting the sea is a lot of trouble;
It never stops still for a moment, so
I try to make it internal, mental,
As though I stopped it, then let it go.

Something began to pulse and tumble
Out of the brushes, the ink, the chalk;
A long black line commenced to tremble,
Then, like a fishline, started to jerk . . .

With what at the end? "I think I've caught it.
A drop of water hung by a hair.
"If I could only stop it a minute!
The drop began to race somewhere,

Spreading out in every direction,
A bird of thread, caught in a storm,
Trying to say, "Connection! Action!
But in the end it was very calm.

Soon there was water under water,
And over the sand a sun . . . a moon?
Who could have seen that wave of water
One night ago? Or a thousand and one?

Who could have seen the lid of water
With its thin mascara of buoys and corks,
With its lined horizon's distant glimmer
Of maybe a skyline like New York's?

Now there will be that morning evening
Tide dyeing the water's pulse,
The wave drying in ink. The Wave.
Moving, momentous, motionless.






The Lie
 

Some bloodied sea-bird's hovering decay
Assails us where we lie, and lie
To make that symbol go away,
To mock the true north of the eye.
But lie to me, lie next to me;
The world is an infirmity.

Too much of sun's been said, too much
Of sea, and of the lover's touch,
Whole volumes that old men debauch.
But we, at the sea's edge curled,
Hurl back their bloody world.
Lie to me, like next to me,

For there is nothing here to see
But the mirrors of ourselves, the day,
Clear with the odors of the sea.
Lie to me. And lie to me.






The Truth About Love
 

It seems to have traveled at night,
Supremely ironic, lighting fires,
Laying golden eggs in the midst of squalor,
Its outer garments, in the latest version,
Sumptuous, its linens more than shoddy,
Drunk, moreover, at a seedy party
The discriminating shunned, and, later, bawdy
In a run-down neighborhood, with whores and sailors
Chosen as companions while the queen went needy.
Now that everything about it is known,
Why does it come up purple or threadbare,
Thrashing all its sunsets in a fit of pique,
Or stripped, in the seamiest hayloft, ready
To repeat dull anecdotes the millionth time,
Its poise unquestionable, its voice unsteady?
It is brilliant, androgynous, and stultifying
With its threats and tears, dissembling always
Its mad obsession with the blurred distinction.
And yet who else
Is so elementary and badly needed
That fifty cultures rise at the merest rumor
Of its presence, and, finally, punctually fall
Whenever it departs, as if on schedule?
Interviewed, Monday, in the city dump,
Which turned, by magic, into a hotel tower,
Shedding poems and paintings for its bath
(It takes ten centuries of running water
To wash it clean), it then emerged, all dirty
Again, in a costume of ferocious splendor,
A hat some milliner in old Vienna
Sweated over, its pumps exchanged for sneakers,
And raced across the city, breaking records,
Just to prove its powers of endurance.
It lies down anywhere, and loves the country,
But is so unassuming it can even flourish
Beneath electric signs and in railroad stations
It goes to for the summer, estivating,
It says, near fountains that escape our notice,
And comes back in the fall, its ribbons flying,
Wheeling through the leaves, singing all the voices
Of every opera in the repertoire
Plus one no one has ever dreamed of writing.
Going about its gigantic business,
It masks itself as any shape or hope,
Appearing as a vicious telephone call,
Or a flat, disturbing message in an envelope.
It praises calmness but adores upheaval,
Is most to be desired when it apes composure,
And much to be distrusted when it boasts it has
The only fingerprint that can be changed at will.






Water Island
 

                                         To the memory of a friend,                                         drowned off Water Island, April, 1960
Finally, from your house, there is no view;
The bay's blind mirror shattered over you
And Patchogue took your body like a log
The wind rolled up to shore. The senseless drowned
Have faces nobody would care to see,
But water loves those gradual erasures
Of flesh and shoreline, greenery and glass,
And you belonged to water, it to you,
Having built, on a hillock, above the bay,
Your house, the bay giving you reason to,
Where now, if seasons still are running straight,
The horseshoe crabs clank armor night and day,
Their couplings far more ancient than the eyes
That watched them from your porch. I saw one once
Whose back was a history of how we live;
Grown onto every inch of plate, except
Where the hinges let it move, were living things,
Barnacles, mussels, water weeds--and one
Blue bit of polished glass, glued there by time:
The origins of art. It carried them
With pride, it seemed, as if endurance only
Matters in the end. Or so I thought.

Skimming traffic lights, starboard and port,
Steer through planted poles that mark the way,
And other lights, across the bay, faint stars
Lining the border of Long Island's shore,
Come on at night, they still come on at night,
Though who can see them now I do not know.
Wild roses, at your back porch, break their blood,
And bud to test surprises of sea air,
And the birds fly over, gliding down to feed
At the two feeding stations you set out with seed,
Or splash themselves in a big bowl of rain
You used to fill with water. Going across
That night, too fast, too dark, no one will know,
Maybe you heard, the last you'll ever hear,
The cry of the savage and endemic gull
Which shakes the blood and always brings to mind
The thought that death, the scavenger, is blind,
Blunders and is stupid, and the end
Comes with ironies so fine the seed
Falters in the marsh and the heron stops
Hunting in the weeds below your landing stairs,
Standing in a stillness that now is yours.





Jane
 

The startling pleasures all broke down,
It was her first arthritic spring.
Inside her furs, her bones, secure,
Suddenly became a source of pain
And froze on a Saturday afternoon
While she was listening to "La Boheme.

Strength had been her weakness, and
Because it was, she got to like
The exhilaration of catastrophes
That prove our lives as stupid as we think,
But pain, more stupid than stupidity,
Is an accident of animals in which, once caught,
The distances are never again the same.

Yet there was another Jane in Jane:
She smelled the inside of a logarithm,
And felt a Gothic arch rise in her chest,
Her clavicle widening to bear the weight
Of the two smooth plumb lines of her breasts,
The blueprints forming an enormous skirt
Around her body. Arch and star and cross
Swung like little lights inside her head,
A church and temple rising from the floor,
Nave and transept and an altar where,
Unbidden, she saw a kind of sacrifice;
The knife was in her hand, the stick, the whip;
She cried at her cruelty and cried to be
Outside of her defenses. And just then,

The windows buckled in, the paintings cracked,
The furniture went walking by itself,
All out of her control. And it was pain
That let her know she was herself again:
She wore a cloak of fire on her skin,
And power, power floated up to her.






Piano Practice
 

For Frances Dillon Hayward
1
Such splendid icecaps and hard rills, such weights
And counter-weights, I think I scale the heights
When pentatonic Chinese crewmen start
Up in a cold sweat from the bottom of the keyboard
Only to arrive at some snow-stormed valley
To dissolve in steam-holes and vanish out of sight.

2
The left hand's library is dull, the books
All read, though sometimes, going under velvet,
An old upholsterer will spit out tacks,
Turn them into sparks and smartly hurl them
Up and down the loudest bowling alley--
His pressure of effects can last all night.

3
Two bird notes endlessly repeat themselves.
Or are they fish scales--iridescent, hard?
Mica into marble back to mica?
No images in trills. They're formal. Take
Your foot off the pedal. You're in a wood
Near the sea. And every tree and wave is fake.

4
An underwater haircut by Debussy?
Oh, that's too easy. Astringent lotions
Let the swimmer down by easy stages
Down among the flashy soda fountains
Down to the bottom where the light bulbs waver
Down where all the mirrors eat their hearts out.

5
Grammar becoming poetry is what
You're after--say, a rational derangement
Requiring that you forget technique
And concentrate on what is harder like
A fireplace that burns pine needles only,
Before which spills the gore of Persian rugs.

6
A vial of antiseptic meant for Schubert,
One modest, flat meticulous translation
Of Chopin's lightning undercurrent Spanish--
These are the mere necessities of travel.
Someone you must meet is Dr. Czerny.
Then, through him, Domenico Scarlatti.

7
Seizure are occurring. Despite snow-lightning,
The black keys are bent on mountain climbing--
All of it against a doctor's warning.
Soon they're descending like the black dots of
A wirephoto in transmission. An
Erotic black wing hovers up above.

8
Bach is more like opening an ember
And digging hard into the heart of fire.
The heart of fire is another fire.
When it comes to Mozart, just say nothing.
Think of it as milk, and drink it slowly.
Slowly you will taste the cream of angels.

9
This black and white's deceptive. Underneath
The spectrum rages. Did you ever see
The calmest waters quickly come to life
Because a minnow's tinfoil flash in sun
Had rent them suddenly? It came. And went.
We take two thousand takes before we print.

10
Don't try to catch that lion by Rousseau.
Before you wake, he'll eat you up. If you
Should meet the sleeping gypsy, let her sleep.
Tomorrow they'll be gone without a trace,
Half fact and half enigma. Now your hands
Are on the mysteries of the commonplace.






Particular Beauties
 

Whether it was a particular beauty
Stirred the tearfall from the eyelid's rim,
Rinsing the world once more with self,
Was it not there the general peered,
Thousand-eyed, down from the peak
In the last of all imaginary sunsets?
The light divided in half, the half
Divided again in half, the way
Zeno's paradox makes nothing move
Because an infinity of points between
Target and arrow, though never seen,
Exists. And there is snow in a capsule,
A solid floor of individual
Flakes that, shaken, settle in a field--
Parachutists growing where the grass,
One moment before, was only natural.
I am speaking now of the diminishment
Or enhancement of enchanted objects,
Of how they turn into nothingness
Or burnish the imagination:
A fire at the bottom of the sea,
For instance, or a mind in space
Thinking its way into science fiction,
Or, inside the skull, a little world
Clinging, about to be thrown away--
Miraculous lint under a bell.






Another Life
 

There might be the quibble of birds and the swag
Of a river and a distantly belled
Altar of animals, softly spoken;
Certainly cattail, sumac, and fern
Would rise from the marshes nearby, revealed
In forms too perfect to envy trees--
Not trying for larger and larger keepsakes.

Cryptic and subtle green, hedgerows
Hiding mysterious deer, the start
Of a rabbit, as if towers and clouds
Had suddenly shadowed an open field--
These would be the events of the day,
Life having narrowed down to please
Natural hungers and thirsts, the grass
Thick at our feet, and, above our heads,
The stars, their fireworks anemones.

What shall I say of the house? Or you?
Only industrious ghosts would know
How lazily cropping up the view
Would make the impossible possible;
Nothing but weekdays would blankly graze
On time's oblivious pastures, free
At last of motive and thought, and we,
Becoming ourselves so naturally,
Would never say, looking up at the sky,
Another life is shining in the sky.






Where the Castle Is
 

The upkeep of the castle is
The downfall of the cottages
Where fishermen and peasants live
Or used to live. The young men leave
In homemade boats in which they drown,
In makeshift planes that burn and crash,
Or die of boredom on the train
That starts each month for Cold Cash,
Only to find when they arrive
That that's not where the castle is.

The women left live in the sticks,
And when they do the weekly wash
Or mend the nets to catch the fish,
They sing this song: "We work for weeks
For nothing. Now the men have gone,
We'd like to be where money talks,
For all the rest is gibberish.
They pack their bags and take the train
And travel through a strange terrain,
But not to where the castle is.

When there's no one left but children
And the very old, the young
And lame survivors play a game
Invariable in its details
In which they take the daily trash
Down to the dump and sing a song
About ash heaps and burials
Whose burden always is the same:
"If we were old, if we were young,
We'd find out where the caste is.

At Cold Cash, where the castle is,
Or where it is supposed to be,
Nobody ever dies, it seems;
They just go on--from first to last
A series of monotonies--
And they play bridge, mah-jongg, and gin
The while they sing their tribal song,
Which has no verse but a refrain:
"We're here. And if we're here, of course,
This must be where the castle is.

But even kings get sick and bank
Accounts go bad and miracles
Occur, though sometimes in reverse;
Elaborate discrepancies
Narrow down from bad to worse;
Abysses open in a wink
Below the shining pinnacles--
"We do not know the place, they sing,
"That once we thought the castle was.
Do you know where the castle is?

They travel near, they travel far
To seek out where the castle is,
And come upon the cottages,
Which lie in smoking ruins, and there's
No man alive, no woman now
To point the way, and though they sift
Through the debris and pan the clay,
Searching for the smallest clues,
They haven't found out to this day
Just where the castle was, or is.






Chekhov
 

We have the whole evening ahead of us,
We think, our eyesight starting to weaken,
We must have missed the houselights growing dim,
But how could that moment have escaped us when
The roots of the paper trees struck water
And transformed themselves into the real thing--
This nervous wood at the edge of a small,
Provincial town whose still lifes waken
To find that they're portraits after all
And subject to the risk of animation?

Tonight we may discuss--after the Chopin
Nocturnes, after the I-don't-know-how-many
Performances of Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata--
The gradual reduction of Roman columns,
The disease of too many lakes and clouds.
Do cobblestones have a future? Is rain
Removable? Depressing mornings find
Characters in bed who have no reason
To get up, the light a yellowish half-light
Mirroring the mind, its sad affections.

At the lake, a flat of faultless summer
Is being taken down, the view abandoned;
The puzzled players change their places. Once
You might have found them walking in an orchard,
The blossoms opening their mouths to speak
And song occurring as if it were natural;
Now that trees uproot themselves and bankrupt
Agriculture wanes in its drying furrows,
Property and battlefields turn out to share
A fate in common--they exchange hands.

Shrines "fallen out of the perpendicular,
Stones "that have apparently once been tombstones--
We are on someone's estate not far from Moscow.
How simply the sun goes out like a match!
How deeply the wounds stay on the surface!
He said the best that can be said for property:
It lets an old man fall in love with landscape,
Lets so many trees have a chance to be noticed,
Allows the self-interested birds to preen,
Until the property is lost again.

To an upstart creditor who sells the trees
For lumber, then, to the sounds of saws,
Tramps through the hallway in his dirty boots
To explain, in tears, the dreary motivation:
His mother's dying, his young wife's in love
With a boor . . . The Babel of trouble starts;
Among all the hells that go on talking,
Only one is real, though it is silent,
And everything leads up to it--to lose
The land, to lose the very ground you stand on.

If the temporary brilliancies gather once more
In the middle distance, and the modal lark
Persuades the summer evening to reveal
One private little splendor not for sale,
Still, a gunshot, onstage or off,
Tells us what no one is prepared to know:
Love is a tourniquet tightening its bands
Around the slowly dying wrist of freedom,
Futility's a spinster bending over
A book of household accounts forever.

Bathed in the acid of truth, all things
Become possible: to be a cold snake
At an interview, to live on scraps of soap
To keep oneself warm, to resemble a cat
Constantly stalking the shadow of nothing,
To the horse's clop-clop outside the window,
Or the sound of a guitar from a neighboring room,
The doctor, with a smile, asks, What is man?
A hero about to be done-in for good?
A villain about to be rescued by pain?

The governess is wearing her old forage cap.
That's Epihodov playing his guitar.
Astrov is talking about trees. We could be 
Racing the wolves at thirty below
In a ravine whiplashed by snow, or slowly
Succumbing to boredom in a seaside town,
Waiting for a future that will never be,
The heat getting worse, far off the waves
Pounding faintly late in the moonlight,
At a low moment in our lives.






Someone
 

You watch the night like a material
Slowly being crammed into a tube of rooms;
It showers into gunshot, pepper, dew,
As if a hand had squeezed it at one end,
Is blank as innocence when daylight comes
Projecting sunlit patches on the wall
That fade. Too much is going on, too much
Of life, you say, for you to live alone
On top of an old tenement, on a train
That might start off sometime, but never does.
Your view is gone. Turn around, and boom!,
A park appears between two fixed ideas
Whose narrow aperture of sky in time
Will house the slums of 1989 . . .

Now New York is feigning its gray dark
London winter. Invisible uptown
Is out there somewhere, raining on its own.
Palmed in the dusty pane, a circle bares
A scene that seems reprinted from the past:
A man with a dog is walking very fast
Along a path among the stunted trees
Of the little square below. He disappears.






The City of Sleep
 

Over the edge of the purple down,
    Where the single lamplight gleams,
 Know ye the road to the Merciful Town
    That is hard by the Sea of Dreams  
 Where the poor may lay their wrongs away,
    And the sick may forget to weep?
 But we  pity us! Oh, pity us!
    We wakeful; ah, pity us! 
 We must go back with Policeman Day  
    Back from the City of Sleep!
  
 Weary they turn from the scroll and crown,
    Fetter and prayer and plough  
 They that go up to the Merciful Town,
    For her gates are closing now.
 It is their right in the Baths of Night
    Body and soul to steep,
 But we  pity us! ah, pity us!
    We wakeful; oh, pity us! 
 We must go back with Policeman Day 
    Back from the City of Sleep!
  
 Over the edge of the purple down,
    Ere the tender dreams begin,
 Look  we may look  at the Merciful Town,
    But we may not enter in!
 Outcasts all, from her guarded wall
    Back to our watch we creep:
 We  pity us! ah, pity us!
    We wakeful; ah, pity us! 
 We that go back with Policeman Day 
    Back from the City of Sleep!





Notes from the Castle
 

The sunlight was not our concern or even
The pane it shone through, and no one was going
Down for the mail, and the four lettuces
The gardener brought as a gift seemed to be 
A calculated bounty, so that early on
We knew we were going to be stuck with ourselves
The rest of the day, the vicissitudes
Marching in rows from the forest, the balms
Not arriving till nightfall. On the prowl
Since morning, the wind had a touch too much
Of motivation, an annoying way
Of exactly ruffling the same oak leaf
As if it were practicing a piano trill;
All day, repetitive birds, far off,
Were either boring themselves to death
Or, drunk on instinct, doing their thing:
Ritual dances, territorial rites--
The whole imperial egg. What nests
Ambition is weaving in us is hard
To say: after the flat occasion,
The unshared sphere, each childish wish
Grows hopeless finding this is what the world is.
For this, the recommended cures are useless:
A cheery hello to the disaffected
At breakfast? A soupful of tears at dinner?
You could spill the whole silly story out
To one more demanding, ill-tempered beauty
You happened to meet at the A. & P.,
And still every greedy shopping cart,
First overstuffed and then abandoned
In the parking lot, would leave in its wake
Some human need, ignored, half-starved . . .
Torn between having nothing to say
And saying it, whole diaries get down:
How terrible to have dressed beautifully for the rain! . . .
I was launched on New York's bisexual muddle . . .
And so on. And always the hoped-for redeemer
Turns up and turns with a country stare:
The girl in the lime linen shorts, the boy
With blond corn-silk tow hair, the heart
Speeding up until they speak: the dross
Of cars, the sportsman's life, and money;
And so, believing that you had come
To rest among the innocent soldiers
Of sleep, you had merely stumbled on
Another temporary battlefield
As never-lasting as the shine of water.






Four Birds
 

"Wake to the sun, the rooster croaked,
First bird of the day. The world, light-flecked,
Chiselled its lineaments into form.
Where was all that fine light coming from?

"Trance at the wonder, the second sang.
Whose five dry notes urged the ongoing
Afternoon on. "Why wake and stir?
It asked. And asked. There was no answer.

"Live through the muddle. That from the next one.
Not very helpful. It looked like rain,
Or fog in the offing. Twilight. Then
It sang again from an oak or pine.

Silence. How I waited for the fourth!
Time was a negative dipped into its bath,
The dark a fixative that slowly made
For every windowpane its window shade.

No messages arrived. No music bared
The soul for its penitence. Up the stairs
No hint of a footfall. The night passed.
"Croak by your hand, said the crow at last.






New Hampshire
 

1
When the loons cry,
The night seems blacker,
The water deeper.

Across the shore:
An eyelash-charcoal
Fringe of pine trees.

2
The lake reflects
Indefinite pewter,

And intermittent thunder
Lets us know

The gods are arriving,
One valley over.

3
After the long
Melancholy of the fall,
One longs for the crisp
Brass shout of winter--

The blaze of firewood,
The window's spill
Of parlor lamplight
Across the snow.

4
Flaring like a match
Dropped in a dry patch,
One sunset tells
The spectrum's story.

See the last hunter's
Flashlight dim
As he hurries home
To his lighted window.






Einsteins Bathrobe
 

I wove myself of many delicious strands
Of violet islands and sugar-balls of thread
So faintly green a small white check between
Balanced the field's wide lawn, a plaid
Gathering in loose folds shaped around him
Those Princeton mornings, slowly stage-lit, when
The dawn took the horizon by surprise
And from the marsh long, crayoned birds
Rose up, ravens, maybe crows, or raw-voiced,
Spiteful grackles with their clothespin legs,
Black-winged gossips rising out of mud
And clattering into sleep. They woke my master
While, in the dark, I waited, knowing
Sooner or later he'd reach for me
And, half asleep, wriggle into my arms.
Then it seemed a moonish, oblique light
Would gradually illuminate the room,
The world turn on its axis at a different slant,
The furniture a shipwreck, the floor askew,
And, in old slippers, he'd bumble down the stairs.
Genius is human and wants its coffee hot--
I remember mornings when he'd sit
For hours at breakfast, dawdling over notes,
Juice and toast at hand, the world awake
To spring, the smell of honeysuckle
Filling the kitchen. A silent man,
Silence became him most. How gently
He softened the edges of a guessed-at impact
So no one would keel over from the blow--
A blow like soft snow falling on a lamb.
He'd fly down from the heights to tie his shoes
And cross the seas to get a glass of milk,
Bismarck with a harp, who'd doff his hat
(As if he ever wore one!) and softly land
On nimble feet so not to startle. He walked
In grandeur much too visible to be seen--
And how many versions crawled out of the Press!
A small pre-Raphaelite with too much hair;
A Frankenstein of test tubes; a "refugee--
A shaman full of secrets who could touch
Physics with a wand and body forth
The universe's baby wrapped in stars.
From signs Phoenicians scratched into the sand
With sticks he drew the contraries of space:
Whirlwind Nothing and Volume in its rage
Of matter racing to undermine itself,
And when the planets sang, why, he sang back
The lieder black holes secretly adore.

At tea at Mercer Street every afternoon
His manners went beyond civility,
Kindness not having anything to learn;
I was completely charmed. And fooled.
What a false view of the universe I had!
The horsehair sofa, the sagging chairs,
A fire roaring behind the firesecreen--
Imagine thinking Princeton was the world!
Yet I wore prescience like a second skin:
When Greenwich and Palomar saw eye to eye,
Time and space having found their rabbi,
I felt the dawn's black augurs gather force,
As if I knew in the New Jersey night
The downcast sky that was to clamp on Europe,
That Asia had its future in my pocket.






The Matrix
 

Goaded and harassed in the factory
   That tears our life up into bits of days
   Ticked off upon a clock which never stays,
Shredding our portion of Eternity,
We break away at last, and steal the key
   Which hides a world empty of hours; ways
   Of space unroll, and Heaven overlays
The leafy, sun-lit earth of Fantasy.
   Beyond the ilex shadow glares the sun,
   Scorching against the blue flame of the sky.
Brown lily-pads lie heavy and supine
   Within a granite basin, under one
   The bronze-gold glimmer of a carp; and I
Reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine.






A London Thoroughfare. 2 A.M.
 

They have watered the street,
 It shines in the glare of lamps,
 Cold, white lamps,
 And lies
 Like a slow-moving river,
 Barred with silver and black.
 Cabs go down it,
 One,
 And then another.
 Between them I hear the shuffling of feet.
 Tramps doze on the window-ledges,
 Night-walkers pass along the sidewalks.
 The city is squalid and sinister,
 With the silver-barred street in the midst,
 Slow-moving,
 A river leading nowhere.

 Opposite my window,
 The moon cuts,
 Clear and round,
 Through the plum-coloured night.
 She cannot light the city;
 It is too bright.
 It has white lamps,
 And glitters coldly.

 I stand in the window and watch the moon.
 She is thin and lustreless,
 But I love her.
 I know the moon,
 And this is an alien city.





The Pike
 

In the brown water,
 Thick and silver-sheened in the sunshine,
 Liquid and cool in the shade of the reeds,
 A pike dozed.
 Lost among the shadows of stems
 He lay unnoticed.
 Suddenly he flicked his tail,
 And a green-and-copper brightness
 Ran under the water.

 Out from under the reeds
 Came the olive-green light,
 And orange flashed up
 Through the sun-thickened water.
 So the fish passed across the pool,
 Green and copper,
 A darkness and a gleam,
 And the blurred reflections of the willows on the opposite bank
 Received it.





Spring Day
 

      Bath  The day is fresh-washed and fair, and there is a smell of tulips and narcissus in the air.  The sunshine pours in at the bath-room window and bores through the water in the bath-tub in lathes and planes of greenish-white. It cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel, and cracks it to bright light.  Little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance, dance, and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling; a stir of my finger sets them whirring, reeling. I move a foot, and the planes of light in the water jar. I lie back and laugh, and let the green-white water, the sun-flawed beryl water, flow over me. The day is almost too bright to bear, the green water covers me from the too bright day. I will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots.  The sky is blue and high. A crow flaps by the window, and there is a whiff of tulips and narcissus in the air.      Breakfast Table  In the fresh-washed sunlight, the breakfast table is decked and white. It offers itself in flat surrender, tendering tastes, and smells, and colours, and metals, and grains, and the white cloth falls over its side, draped and wide. Wheels of white glitter in the silver coffee-pot, hot and spinning like catherine-wheels, they whirl, and twirl--and my eyes begin to smart, the little white, dazzling wheels prick them like darts. Placid and peaceful, the rolls of bread spread themselves in the sun to bask. A stack of butter-pats, pyramidal, shout orange through the white, scream, flutter, call: "Yellow! Yellow! Yellow! Coffee steam rises in a stream, clouds the silver tea-service with mist, and twists up into the sunlight, revolved, involuted, suspiring higher and higher, fluting in a thin spiral up the high blue sky. A crow flies by and croaks at the coffee steam. The day is new and fair with good smells in the air.      Walk  Over the street the white clouds meet, and sheer away without touching.  On the sidewalks, boys are playing marbles. Glass marbles, with amber and blue hearts, roll together and part with a sweet clashing noise. The boys strike them with black and red striped agates. The glass marbles spit crimson when they are hit, and slip into the gutters under rushing brown water. I smell tulips and narcissus in the air, but there are no flowers anywhere, only white dust whipping up the street, and a girl with a gay Spring hat and blowing skirts. The dust and the wind flirt at her ankles and her neat, high-heeled patent leather shoes. Tap, tap, the little heels pat the pavement, and the wind rustles among the flowers on her hat.  A water-cart crawls slowly on the other side of the way. It is green and gay with new paint, and rumbles contentedly, sprinkling clear water over the white dust. Clear zigzagging water, which smells of tulips and narcissus.  The thickening branches make a pink grisaille against the blue sky.  Whoop! The clouds go dashing at each other and sheer away just in time. Whoop! And a man's hat careers down the street in front of the white dust, leaps into the branches of a tree, veers away and trundles ahead of the wind, jarring the sunlight into spokes of rose-colour and green.  A motor-car cuts a swathe through the bright air, sharp-beaked, irresistible, shouting to the wind to make way. A glare of dust and sunshine tosses together behind it, and settles down. The sky is quiet and high, and the morning is fair with fresh-washed air.      Midday and Afternoon  Swirl of crowded streets. Shock and recoil of traffic. The stock-still brick faade of an old church, against which the waves of people lurch and withdraw. Flare of sunshine down side-streets. Eddies of light in the windows of chemists' shops, with their blue, gold, purple jars, darting colours far into the crowd. Loud bangs and tremors, murmurings out of high windows, whirring of machine belts, blurring of horses and motors. A quick spin and shudder of brakes on an electric car, and the jar of a church-bell knocking against the metal blue of the sky. I am a piece of the town, a bit of blown dust, thrust along with the crowd. Proud to feel the pavement under me, reeling with feet. Feet tripping, skipping, lagging, dragging, plodding doggedly, or springing up and advancing on firm elastic insteps. A boy is selling papers, I smell them clean and new from the press. They are fresh like the air, and pungent as tulips and narcissus.  The blue sky pales to lemon, and great tongues of gold blind the shop-windows, putting out their contents in a flood of flame.      Night and Sleep  The day takes her ease in slippered yellow. Electric signs gleam out along the shop fronts, following each other. They grow, and grow, and blow into patterns of fire-flowers as the sky fades. Trades scream in spots of light at the unruffled night. Twinkle, jab, snap, that means a new play; and over the way: plop, drop, quiver, is the sidelong sliver of a watchmaker's sign with its length on another street. A gigantic mug of beer effervesces to the atmosphere over a tall building, but the sky is high and has her own stars, why should she heed ours?  I leave the city with speed. Wheels whirl to take me back to my trees and my quietness. The breeze which blows with me is fresh-washed and clean, it has come but recently from the high sky. There are no flowers in bloom yet, but the earth of my garden smells of tulips and narcissus.  My room is tranquil and friendly. Out of the window I can see the distant city, a band of twinkling gems, little flower-heads with no stems. I cannot see the beer-glass, nor the letters of the restaurants and shops I passed, now the signs blur and all together make the city, glowing on a night of fine weather, like a garden stirring and blowing for the Spring.  The night is fresh-washed and fair and there is a whiff of flowers in the air.  Wrap me close, sheets of lavender. Pour your blue and purple dreams into my ears. The breeze whispers at the shutters and mutters queer tales of old days, and cobbled streets, and youths leaping their horses down marble stairways. Pale blue lavender, you are the colour of the sky when it is fresh-washed and fair . . . I smell the stars . . . they are like tulips and narcissus . . . I smell them in the air.





Towns in Colour
 

     I   Red Slippers
  Red slippers in a shop-window, and outside in the street, flaws of grey, windy sleet!  Behind the polished glass, the slippers hang in long threads of red, festooning from the ceiling like stalactites of blood, flooding the eyes of passers-by with dripping colour, jamming their crimson reflections against the windows of cabs and tram-cars, screaming their claret and salmon into the teeth of the sleet, plopping their little round maroon lights upon the tops of umbrellas.  The row of white, sparkling shop fronts is gashed and bleeding, it bleeds red slippers. They spout under the electric light, fluid and fluctuating, a hot rain--and freeze again to red slippers, myriadly multiplied in the mirror side of the window.  They balance upon arched insteps like springing bridges of crimson lacquer; they swing up over curved heels like whirling tanagers sucked in a wind-pocket; they flatten out, heelless, like July ponds, flared and burnished by red rockets.  Snap, snap, they are cracker-sparks of scarlet in the white, monotonous block of shops.  They plunge the clangour of billions of vermilion trumpets into the crowd outside, and echo in faint rose over the pavement.  People hurry by, for these are only shoes, and in a window, farther down, is a big lotus bud of cardboard whose petals open every few minutes and reveal a wax doll, with staring bead eyes and flaxen hair, lolling awkwardly in its flower chair.  One has often seen shoes, but whoever saw a cardboard lotus bud before?  The flaws of grey, windy sleet beat on the shop-window where there are only red slippers.
      II   Thompson's Lunch Room--Grand Central Station   Study in Whites Wax-white-- Floor, ceiling, walls. Ivory shadows Over the pavement Polished to cream surfaces By constant sweeping. The big room is coloured like the petals Of a great magnolia, And has a patina Of flower bloom Which makes it shine dimly Under the electric lamps. Chairs are ranged in rows Like sepia seeds Waiting fulfilment. The chalk-white spot of a cook's cap Moves unglossily against the vaguely bright wall-- Dull chalk-white striking the retina like a blow Through the wavering uncertainty of steam. Vitreous-white of glasses with green reflections, Ice-green carboys, shifting--greener, bluer--with the jar of moving water. Jagged green-white bowls of pressed glass Rearing snow-peaks of chipped sugar Above the lighthouse-shaped castors Of grey pepper and grey-white salt. Grey-white placards: "Oyster Stew, Cornbeef Hash, Frankfurters: Marble slabs veined with words in meandering lines. Dropping on the white counter like horn notes Through a web of violins, The flat yellow lights of oranges, The cube-red splashes of apples, In high plated  pergnes. The electric clock jerks every half-minute: "Coming!--Past! "Three beef-steaks and a chicken-pie, Bawled through a slide while the clock jerks heavily. A man carries a china mug of coffee to a distant chair. Two rice puddings and a salmon salad Are pushed over the counter; The unfulfilled chairs open to receive them. A spoon falls upon the floor with the impact of metal striking stone, And the sound throws across the room Sharp, invisible zigzags Of silver.      III   An Opera House Within the gold square of the proscenium arch, A curtain of orange velvet hangs in stiff folds, Its tassels jarring slightly when someone crosses the stage behind. Gold carving edges the balconies, Rims the boxes, Runs up and down fluted pillars. Little knife-stabs of gold Shine out whenever a box door is opened. Gold clusters Flash in soft explosions On the blue darkness, Suck back to a point, And disappear. Hoops of gold Circle necks, wrists, fingers, Pierce ears, Poise on heads And fly up above them in coloured sparkles. Gold! Gold! The opera house is a treasure-box of gold. Gold in a broad smear across the orchestra pit: Gold of horns, trumpets, tubas; Gold--spun-gold, twittering-gold, snapping-gold Of harps. The conductor raises his baton, The brass blares out Crass, crude, Parvenu, fat, powerful, Golden. Rich as the fat, clapping hands in the boxes. Cymbals, gigantic, coin-shaped, Crash. The orange curtain parts And the prima-donna steps forward. One note, A drop: transparent, iridescent, A gold bubble, It floats . . . floats . . . And bursts against the lips of a bank president In the grand tier.      IV   Afternoon Rain in State Street Cross-hatchings of rain against grey walls, Slant lines of black rain In front of the up and down, wet stone sides of buildings. Below, Greasy, shiny, black, horizontal, The street. And over it, umbrellas, Black polished dots Struck to white An instant, Stream in two flat lines Slipping past each other with the smoothness of oil. Like a four-sided wedge The Custom House Tower Pokes at the low, flat sky, Pushing it farther and farther up, Lifting it away from the house-tops, Lifting it in one piece as though it were a sheet of tin, With the lever of its apex. The cross-hatchings of rain cut the Tower obliquely, Scratching lines of black wire across it, Mutilating its perpendicular grey surface With the sharp precision of tools. The city is rigid with straight lines and angles, A chequered table of blacks and greys. Oblong blocks of flatness Crawl by with low-geared engines, And pass to short upright squares Shrinking with distance. A steamer in the basin blows its whistle, And the sound shoots across the rain hatchings, A narrow, level bar of steel. Hard cubes of lemon Superimpose themselves upon the fronts of buildings As the windows light up. But the lemon cubes are edged with angles Upon which they cannot impinge. Up, straight, down, straight--square. Crumpled grey-white papers Blow along the side-walks, Contorted, horrible, Without curves. A horse steps in a puddle, A white, glaring water spurts up In stiff, outflaring lines, Like the rattling stems of reeds. The city is heraldic with angles, A sombre escutcheon of argent and sable And countercoloured bends of rain Hung over a four-square civilization. When a street lamp comes out, I gaze at it for full thirty seconds To rest my brain with the suffusing, round brilliance of its globe.      V   An Aquarium Streaks of green and yellow iridescence, Silver shiftings, Rings veering out of rings, Silver--gold-- Grey-green opaqueness sliding down, With sharp white bubbles Shooting and dancing, Flinging quickly outward. Nosing the bubbles, Swallowing them, Fish. Blue shadows against silver-saffron water, The light rippling over them In steel-bright tremors. Outspread translucent fins Flute, fold, and relapse; The threaded light prints through them on the pebbles In scarcely tarnished twinklings. Curving of spotted spines, Slow up-shifts, Lazy convolutions: Then a sudden swift straightening And darting below: Oblique grey shadows Athwart a pale casement. Roped and curled, Green man-eating eels Slumber in undulate rhythms, With crests laid horizontal on their backs. Barred fish, Striped fish, Uneven disks of fish, Slip, slide, whirl, turn, And never touch. Metallic blue fish, With fins wide and yellow and swaying Like Oriental fans, Hold the sun in their bellies And glow with light: Blue brilliance cut by black bars. An oblong pane of straw-coloured shimmer, Across it, in a tangent, A smear of rose, black, silver. Short twists and upstartings, Rose-black, in a setting of bubbles: Sunshine playing between red and black flowers On a blue and gold lawn. Shadows and polished surfaces, Facets of mauve and purple, A constant modulation of values. Shaft-shaped, With green bead eyes; Thick-nosed, Heliotrope-coloured; Swift spots of chrysolite and coral; In the midst of green, pearl, amethyst irradiations. Outside, A willow-tree flickers With little white jerks, And long blue waves Rise steadily beyond the outer islands.





Interlude
 

When I have baked white cakes
And grated green almonds to spread upon them; 
When I have picked the green crowns from the strawberries
And piled them, cone-pointed, in a blue and yellow platter;
When I have smoothed the seam of the linen I have been working;
What then?
To-morrow it will be the same:
Cakes and strawberries,
And needles in and out of cloth.
If the sun is beautiful on bricks and pewter,
How much more beautiful is the moon,
Slanting down the gauffered branches of a plum-tree;
The moon, 
Wavering across a bed of tulips; 
The moon,
Still,
Upon your face.
You shine, Beloved,
You and the moon.
But which is the reflection?
The clock is striking eleven.
I think, when we have shut and barred the door,
The night will be dark
Outside.





The Broken Fountain
 

Oblong, its jutted ends rounding into circles,
The old sunken basin lies with its flat, marble lip
An inch below the terrace tiles.
Over the stagnant water
Slide reflections:
The blue-green of coned yews;
The purple and red of trailing fuchsias
Dripping out of marble urns;
Bright squares of sky
Ribbed by the wake of a swimming beetle.
Through the blue-bronze water
Wavers the pale uncertainty of a shadow.
An arm flashes through the reflections,
A breast is outlined with leaves.
Outstretched in the quiet water
The statue of a Goddess slumbers. 
But when Autumn comes
The beech leaves cover her with a golden counter-pane.





Dreams in War Time
 

I
I wandered through a house of many rooms.
It grew darker and darker,
Until, at last, I could only find my way
By passing my fingers along the wall.
Suddenly my hand shot through an open window,
And the thorn of a rose I could not see
Pricked it so sharply
That I cried aloud.

      II
I dug a grave under an oak-tree.
With infinite care, I stamped my spade
Into the heavy grass.
The sod sucked it,
And I drew it out with effort,
Watching the steel run liquid in the moonlight
As it came clear.
I stooped, and dug, and never turned,
For behind me,
On the dried leaves,
My own face lay like a white pebble,
Waiting.

      III
I gambled with a silver money.
The dried seed-vessels of "honesty
Were stacked in front of me.
Dry, white years slipping through my fingers
One by one.
One by one, gathered by the Croupier.
"Faites vos jeux, Messieurs.
I staked on the red,
And the black won.
Dry years, 
Dead years;
But I had a system,
I always staked on the red.

      IV
I painted the leaves of bushes red
And shouted: "Fire! Fire!
But the neighbors only laughed.
"We cannot warm our hands at them, they said.
Then they cut down my bushes,
And made a bonfire,
And danced about it.
But I covered my face and wept,
For ashes are not beautiful
Even in the dawn.

      V
I followed a procession of singing girls
Who danced to the glitter of tambourines. 
Where the street turned at a lighted corner,
I caught the purple dress of one of the dancers,
But, as I grasped it, it tore,
And the purple dye ran from it
Like blood
Upon the ground.

      VI
I wished to post a letter,
But although I paid much,
Still the letter was overweight.
"What is in this package? said the clerk,
"It is very heavy.
"Yes, I said,
"And yet it is only a dried fruit.

      VII
I had made a kite,
On it I had pasted golden stars 
And white torches,
And the tail was spotted scarlet like a tiger-lily,
And very long.
I flew my kite,
And my soul was contented
Watching it flash against the concave of the sky.
My friends pointed at the clouds;
They begged me to take in my kite.
But I was happy
Seeing the mirror shock of it
Against the black clouds.
Then the lightning came
And struck the kite.
It puffed--blazed--fell.
But still I walked on,
In the drowning rain,
Slowly winding up the string.





The Owl
 

Downhill I came, hungry, and yet not starved; 
Cold, yet had heat within me that was proof 
Against the North wind; tired, yet so that rest 
Had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof. 

Then at the inn I had food, fire, and rest, 
Knowing how hungry, cold, and tired was I. 
All of the night was quite barred out except 
An owl's cry, a most melancholy cry 

Shaken out long and clear upon the hill, 
No merry note, nor cause of merriment, 
But one telling me plain what I escaped 
And others could not, that night, as in I went. 

And salted was my food, and my repose, 
Salted and sobered, too, by the bird's voice 
Speaking for all who lay under the stars, 
Soldiers and poor, unable to rejoice. 






Seder-Night
 

Prosaic miles of streets stretch all round,
    Astir with restless, hurried life and spanned
By arches that with thund'rous trains resound, 
    And throbbing wires that galvanize the land;
    Gin-palaces in tawdry splendor stand;
The newsboys shriek of mangled bodies found;
    The last burlesque is playing in the Strand--
In modern prose all poetry seems drowned.
Yet in ten thousand homes this April night
    An ancient People celebrates its birth
    To Freedom, with a reverential mirth,
With customs quaint and many a hoary rite,
Waiting until, its tarnished glories bright,
    Its God shall be the God of all the earth.





For We Are Thy People
 

For we are thy people, and thou art our God;
We are thy children and thou our father.
We are thy servants, and thou art our master;
We are thy congregation and thou our portion.
We are thine inheritance, thou our lot;
We are thy flock, thou our shepherd.
We are thy vineyard, and thou art our keeper;
We are thy work, and thou our creator.
We are thy faithful one: thou art our beloved;
We are thy chosen: thou art the Lord our God.
We are thy subjects, thou our King;
We are thine acknowledged people, thou our acknowledged Lord.





His Sovereignty
 

His sovereignty is o'er my gathered throng;
 His glory is my faith within,
 I seek Him for atonement of my sin--
 This day of fasting to forgive the wrong:
 And He will answer, He will say, "Forgiven.
  
 Holy--and mighty in His chamber o'er the skies;
 Holy--in penitence alone His pardon lies;
 Holy--the secret of His Law He tells His own
 Holy--for all His sheep rejoicing to atone;
 Holy--He pardoneth His faithful one that pleads;
 Holy--and all His people praise His mighty deeds;
 Holy--His faithful one remembering in His love;
 Holy--He loves the soul's affliction of His dove.
 Holy--on those unclean His cleansing waters flow;
 Holy--His people's sin He maketh white as snow.
 Holy--yea, Israel of their error maketh clear;
 Holy--He sets apart one day in all the year;
 Holy--He pardons them whose longing turns to Him.
 Holy--above the highest heights He standeth dim;
 Holy--and He is good to those who bear His fear;
 Holy--forgiving sin His wrath will not appear;
 Holy--by righteousness He drives transgressions hence;
 Holy--He holds this day of fast for penitence.
 Holy--He gently leads to Him His holy one;
 Holy--thus merciful beside Him there is none;
 Holy--'mid clouds abiding where His dwelling lies:
 Holy--and angels tell His glory through the skies.
  
 His sovereignty is o'er my gathered throng;
 His glory is my faith within.
 I seek Him for atonement of my sin--
 This day of fasting to forgive the wrong:
 And He will answer, He will say, "Forgiven.






The Terrible Sons
 

The terrible sons of the mighty race 
Shout in thunder the Lord is King, 
The angels whose figure the lightnings trace 
Flame to the world that the Lord was King, 
And seraphs whose stature is one with Space, 
Proclaim that the Lord shall be King for ever. 
The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever. 

The rushing and undulant sons of fire 
Fiercely cry that the Lord is King, 
The rustling legions with harp and lyre 
Sweetly tell that the Lord was King, 
And numberless creatures in ceaseless choir 
Chant that the Lord shall be King for ever. 
The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever. 

The bards who remember the songs of yore 
Sing aloud that the Lord is King, 
The sages enshrouded in mystic lore 
Find and proclaim that the Lord was King, 
And rulers of spans of the heavenly floor 
Cry that the Lord shall be King for ever. 
The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever. 

The heirs of the Torah, Thy rich bequest, 
Chant in joy that the Lord is King, 
The lordly warriors with crown and crest 
Crown Thee, declaring the Lord was King, 
And angels in fiery garments drest 
Repeat that the Lord shall be King for ever. 
The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever. 

Mellifluous orators trained of tongue 
Preach and teach that the Lord is King, 
The shimmering cherubim, radiant, young, 
Trumpet exultant the Lord was King, 
And seraphim circling have ever sung 
The song that the Lord shall be King for ever. 
The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever.

Thy people in passionate worship cry 
One to another the Lord is King. 
In awe of the marvels beneath the sky 
Each explains that the Lord was King. 
One sound from Thy pastures ascends on high: 
The chant that the Lord shall be King for ever. 
The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever. 

Assemblies of holiness consecrate 
Thee with the cry that the Lord is King, 
Innumerous myriads iterate 
Only this--that the Lord was King, 
And flame-flashing angels enthroned in state 
Echo the Lord shall be King for ever. 
The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever. 

The universe throbs with Thy pauseless praise, 
Chorus eternal, the Lord is King. 
Thy glory is cried from the dawn of days, 
Worshippers calling the Lord was King. 
And ever the Saints who shall witness Thy ways 
Shall cry that the Lord shall be King for ever. 
The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever. 






Open the Gates
 

Open the gates--the gates of the Temple,
Swift to Thy sons, who Thy truths have displayed.

Open the gates--the gates that are hidden,
Swift to Thy sons, who Thy Law have obeyed.

Open the gates--of the coveted Temple,
Swift to Thy sons who confess and seek grace.

Open the gates--of the armies celestial,
Swift to Thy sons, Judah's tearful-eyed race.

Open the gates--the radiant portals,
Swift to Thy sons who are lovely and pure.

Open the gates--of the crown of fidelity,
Swift to Thy sons who in God rest secure.





Sonnet
 

I had not thought of violets late,
The wild, shy kind that spring beneath your feet
In wistful April days, when lovers mate
And wander through the fields in raptures sweet.
The thought of violets meant florists' shops,
And cabarets and soaps, and deadening wines.
So far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed,
I had forgot wide fields; and clear brown streams;
The perfect loveliness that God has made,--
Wild violets shy and Heaven-mounting dreams.
And now--unwittingly, you've made me dream
Of violets, and my soul's forgotten gleam.





To Him Who Is Feared
 

To Him who is feared a Crown will I bring.
Thrice Holy each day acclaim Him my King;
At altars, ye mighty, proclaim loud His praise,
And multitudes too may whisper His lays.
Ye angels, ye men, whose good deeds He records--
Sing, He is One, His is good, our yoke is the Lord's!
Praise Him trembling to-day, His mercy is wide--
Ye who fear for His wrath--it doth not abide!
Ye seraphim, high above storm clouds may sing;
Men and angels make music, th' All-seeing is king. 
As ye open your lips, at His Name they shall cease--
Transgression and sin--in their place shall be peace;
And thrice shall the Shophar re-echo your song
On mountain and altar to whom both belong. 






Rock of My Salvation
 

Mighty, praised beyond compare,
 Rock of my salvation,
 Build again my house of prayer,
 For Thy habitation!
 Offering and libation, shall a ransomed nation
 Joyful bring
 There, and sing
 Psalms of Dedication!
  
 Woe was mine in Egypt-land,
 (Tyrant kings enslaved me);
 Till Thy mighty, out-stretched Hand
 From oppression saved me.
 Pharaoh, rash pursuing, vowed my swift undoing--
 Soon, his host
 That proud boast
 'Neath the waves was rueing!
  
 To Thy Holy Hill, the way
 Madest Thou clear before me;
 With false gods I went astray--
 Foes to exile bore me.
 Torn from all I cherished, almost had I perished--
 Babylon fell,
    Ze-ru-ba-bel
 Badest Thou to restore me!
  
 Then the vengeful Haman wrought
 Subtly, to betray me;
 In his snare himself he caught--
 He that plann'd to slay me.
 (Haled from Esther's palace; hanged on his own gallows!)
 Seal and ring
 Persia's king
 Gave Thy servant zealous.
  
 When the brave Asmonans broke
 Javan's chain in sunder,
 Through the holy oil, Thy folk
 Didst Thou show a wonder--
 Ever full remained the vessel unprofand;
 These eight days,
 Lights and praise,
 Therefore were ordaind.
  
 Lord, Thy Holy Arm make bare,
 Speed my restoration;
 Be my martyr's blood Thy care--
 Judge each guilty nation.
 Long is my probation; sore my tribulation--
 Bid, from Heaven,
 Thy shepherds seven
 Haste to my salvation!





Flies Buzzing
 

somewhere in america, in a certain state of grace . . .                                                    Patti Smith
As a child I danced
to the heartful, savage
rhythm 
of the Native, the
American Indian,
in the Turtle Mountains,
in the Round Hall,
in the greasy light of
kerosene lamps.

As a child I danced
among the long, jangle legs of
the men, down
     beside the whispering moccasin women,
in close circles
around the Old Ones,
who sat at the drum,
their heads tossed, backs arched
     in ancient prayer.

As a child I danced away from the fist,
I danced toward the rhythms of life,
I danced into dreams, into
     the sound of flies buzzing.
A deer advancing but clinging to the forest wall,
the old red woman rocking in her tattered shawl,
the young women bent, breasts
drooping to the mouths of their young, the heat
hanging heavy on the tips of our tongues,
until the Sun
burned the sky black, the moon
made us silvery blue and
all of the night sounds, all of the night sounds

folded together with the buzzing
still in our heads,
becoming a chant of ghosts,
of Crazy Horse and Wovoka
and all the Endless Others,
snaking through the weaving through the trees
like beams of ribbons of light,
     singing, we shall live again we shall live,

until the Sun and the Sun and the Sun and I
awaken,
still a child, still dancing
toward the rhythm of life.

Pastoral
 

Something in the field is
working away. Root-noise.
Twig-noise. Plant
of weak chlorophyll, no
name for it. Something
in the field has mastered
distance by living too close
to fences. Yellow fruit, has it
pit or seeds? Stalk of wither. Grass-
noise fighting weed-noise. Dirt
and chant. Something in the 
field. Coreopsis. I did not mean
to say that. Yellow petal, has it
wither-gift? Has it gorgeous
rash? Leaf-loss and worried
sprout, its bursting art. Some-
thing in the. Field fallowed and
cicada. I did not mean to
say. Has it roar and bloom?
Has it road and follow? A thistle
prick, fraught burrs, such
easy attachment. Stem-
and stamen-noise. Can I lime-
flower? Can I chamomile?
Something in the field cannot.






Genealogy
 

This stream took a shorter course--
a thread of water that makes oasis

out of mud, in pooling,
does not aspire to lake. To river, leave

the forest, the clamorous wild.
I cannot. Wherever I am,

I am here, nonsensical, rhapsodic,
stock-still as the trees. Trickling

never floods, furrows its meager path
through the forest floor.

There will always be a root
too thirsty, moss that only swallows

and spreads. Primordial home, I am dying
from love of you. Were I tuber or quillwort,

the last layer of leaves that starts the dirt
or the meekest pond,

I would absorb everything.
I would drown. Water makes song

of erratic forms, and I hear the living
push back branches, wander off trail.






The Voyage Home
 

The social instincts ... naturally lead to the golden rule.  --CHARLES DARWIN, The Descent of Man
1 
Holding her steady, into the pitch and roll,   
in raw Midwestern hands ten thousand tons   
of winter wheat for the fall of Rome, 
still swallowing the hunger of the war:   
the binnacle glows like an open fire, 
east-southeast and steady, 
Anderssen, the Viking mate, 
belaboring me for contraband, 
my little book of Einstein, that 
"Commie Jew. (So much for the social instincts,   
pacifism, humanism, the frail 
and noble causes.) I speak my piece 
for western civ: light bends ... 
stars warp ... mass converts ... 
"Pipe dreams, says the Dane, "pipe dreams. 
"Well, mate, remember, 
those Jewish dreams made nightmares   
out of Hiroshima, and 
blew us out of uniform, alive. 
He stomps down off the bridge; some day   
he'll fire me off his rusty 
liberty: I read too much. 
The ocean tugs and wrestles with 
ten thousand deadweight tons 
of charity, trembling on 
degrees and minutes. Anderssen 
steams back in with coffee, to 
contest the stars with Einstein, full ahead.   
We haven't come to Darwin. 

       2 
Freezing on the flying bridge, 
staring at the night for nothing,   
running lights of freighters lost 
in a blur of blowing snow, 
we hold on through the midnight watch,   
waiting out the bells. 
With Einstein in our wake, the tricks   
are easier: liberty 
churns on, ten knots an hour, 
toward Rome. One starry night 
we ride at last with Darwin on 
the Beagle: endless ocean, sea 
sickness, revelations 
of Toxodon and Megalonyx--a voyage   
old as the Eocene, the watery death   
of Genesis. The going 
gets rough again, the threat of all those bones   
churning the heavy swells: Anderssen,   
a true believer, skeptical, 
and Darwin trapped in a savage earthquake,   
the heave of coastal strata conjuring   
the wreck of England, lofty houses gone,   
government in chaos, 
violence and pillage through the land,   
and afterward, 
fossils gleaming white along 
the raw ridges. 
"Limeys. Anderssen puts his benediction   
to empire: "Stupid Limeys. After that 
we breathe a bit and watch the stars and tell   
sad stories of the death of tribes, the bones,   
the countless bones: we talk about   
the war, we talk about 
extinction. 

       3 
Okinawa, Iwo Jima: 
slouching toward Tokyo, the only good Jap   
is a dead Jap. 
We must get the bomb, Einstein writes   
to F.D.R., waking from 
the dreams of peace, the noble causes:   
get it first, before 
the Nazis do. (The only good Nazi   
is an extinct Nazi.) 
At the death of Hiroshima, all day long   
we celebrate extinction, chugalugging   
free beer down at the px, teen- 
age kids in khaki puking pints 
of three-point-two in honor 
of the fire: no more island-hopping now   
to the murderous heart of empire.   
Later, in the luxury of peace, 
the bad dreams come. "Certainly,   
Darwin broods, "no fact 
in the long history of the world 
is so startling as the wide and repeated   
extermination 
of its inhabitants. 

       4 
Off somewhere to starboard, the Canaries,   
Palma, Tenerife: sunrise 
backlights the rugged peaks, as Darwin,   
twenty-two years old, gazes at   
the clouds along the foothills.   
Longitudes ease westward; it's   
my birthday: twenty-two years old   
as Tenerife falls into the sunset,   
I'm as greedy for the old world 
as Darwin for the new, Bahia, Desire,   
the palms and crimson flowers   
of the Mediterranean, clear water   
dancing with mines. Ahead of us   
a tanker burns; the war 
will never end. 

       5 
"You talk a lot, says the melancholy Dane. 
"You sure you're not Jewish yourself? 
You got a funny name. 
"Well, mate, I'm pure Celtic on one side, 
pure Orphan on the other: therefore half 
of anything at all--Jewish, Danish, 
what you will: a problem, isn't it,   
for Hitler, say, or the Klan, 
or even Gregor Mendel, sweating out the summer   
in his pea patch? 
The fact is, I know those ancestors 
floating through my sleep: 
an animal that breathed water,   
had a great swimming tail, 
an imperfect skull, undoubtedly   
hermaphrodite ... I slide 
through all the oceans with these kin,   
salt water pulsing in my veins,   
and aeons follow me into the trees: 
a hairy, tailed quadruped, 
arboreal in its habits, scales 
slipping off my flanks, the angle of my spine   
thrust upward, brain 
bulging the skull until 
I ride the Beagle 
down the eastern trades to earthquake,   
to naked cannibals munching red meat 
and Spanish grandees with seven names 
crushing the fingers of slaves. 
Who are my fathers? mothers? who 
will I ever father? 
I will sire the one in my rubber sea-boots, who   
has sailed the seas and come 
to the bones of Megatherium. 
From the war of nature, from famine and death,   
we stand at last creators 
of ourselves: "The greatest 
human satisfaction, Darwin muses, "is derived   
from following the social instincts. Well,   
the thing I want to father 
is the rarest, most difficult thing 
in any nature: I want to be, 
knee-deep in these rivers of innocent blood,   
a decent animal. 

       6 
Landfall: Yankee liberty discharges   
calories on the docks, where kids   
with fingers formed by hairy   
quadrupeds cross 
mumbo jumbo on their chests   
and rub small signs for hope   
and charity. 
Liberty, sucked empty of its 
social instincts, follows the Beagle  
down the empty avenues of water   
to amber waves of grain, to feed   
the children of our fathers' wars,   
new generations of orphans, lives   
our quaint old-fashioned bombs   
had not quite ended. 

       7 
Alone 
on the fantail 
I hear the grind of rigging, and 
Darwin is beside me, leaning on the rail,   
watching the wake go phosphorescent.   
We've been out five years, have seen   
the coral islands, the dark skins 
of Tahiti; I have questions. 
"Darwin, I whisper, "tell me now, 
have you entered into the springs of the sea,   
or have you walked in search of the depth?   
Did you give the gorgeous wings to peacocks,   
or feathers to the ostrich? 
Have you given the horse his strength   
and clothed his neck with thunder? 
Who has put wisdom in the inward parts,   
and given understanding to the heart?   
Answer me. 
The breeze is making eddies in the mist, 
and out of those small whirlwinds come the words:   
"I have walked along the bottom of the sea   
wrenched into the clouds at Valparaiso;   
I have seen the birth of islands and 
the build of continents; I 
know the rise and fall of mountain ranges,   
I understand the wings of pigeons, 
peacock feathers, finches; my mind creates   
general laws out of large 
collections of facts. 
The rigging sighs a little: God 
is slipping away without 
saying goodbye, goodbye to Jewish dreams.   
"But the activities of the mind, 
Darwin murmurs, "are one of the bases of conscience. 
Astern the pious Spaniards go on praying 
and crushing the fingers of slaves; somewhere   
the Mylodon wanders away, 
out of the animal kingdom and 
into the empire of death. 
For five billion years 
we have seen the past, and 
it works. 

       8 
So this is the final convoy 
of the social instincts: the next   
time missiles fly to Rome, 
they will carry Einstein's dream of fire,   
and afterward there will be no need   
for liberties, hope, or charity.   
Now we ride the oceans of   
imagination, all horizon 
and no port. Darwin 
will soon be home, his five-year   
voyage on this little brig 
all over; but when will I 
be home, when will I arrive 
at that special creation: a decent animal? 
The land is failing the horizons, and   
we only know to take the wheel 
and test the ancient strength of human struggle,   
remembering that we ourselves, the wonder 
and glory of the universe, bear 
in our lordly bones the indelible stamp   
of our lowly 
origin.





This Corner of the Western World
 

Dark thing,
make a myth of yourself:

all women turn into lilacs,

all men grow sick of their errant scent.
You could learn

to build a window, to change flesh
into isinglass, nothing

but a brittle river, a love of bone.

You could snap like a branch--No,

this way, he says, and the fence
releases the forest,

and every blue insect finds an inch of skin.
He loves low voices, diffidence

on the invented trail,

the stones you fuck him on. Yes
to sweat's souvenir, yes to his fist

in your hair, you bite

because you can. Silence
rides the back of your throat,

his tongue, your name.






Confession
 

Perhaps I'm a cruel artist. I always depict
In great details, lovingly, all the defects
On the faces and bodies of my models.
I use my eyes and brushes to thread
The jagged gaps of their stiff smiles. I pamper
Each pimple, hump, massage each incrustation.

I cajole my models into poses that are awkward,
Dangerous, unhygienic, sometimes mortifying.
I don't care to paint smooth, poreless skin but collect
All manners of rashes and eruptions. Inspired,
I've forced a hundred bodies--impossibly old,
Extremely young--onto appalling heaps,

Democratically naked, viscous with sweat, spit and etc.,
Just so I could render the human condition
Most accurately and movingly.

The Ecstasy of Capitulation
 

I.
One reason to eat is to not speak, said the man
with a mouth full of food. When she told me that my

silence was worse than her silence, I agreed,
even though she was wrong. It is shallow to fight

for things, he said, but sometimes it can be fun. You
look like a tunnel, she said, and kissed my lips. What 

I like least about words is their capacity
to invoke more words, she said, as she trashed my

poem. According to the New York Times, gay
teenage boys want monogamy while

heterosexual boys prefer "friends with
benefits. My psychiatrist told me it was

okay to lie about the important details
of my life. As a result, I fell in love with

her. I stopped seeing her as a patient but when
we dated the spark was gone. If, as Cioran writes,

existing is plagiarism, then what is death?
I was lost all night in the forest only to

discover these were streets I knew quite well. In the 
Oresteia, Apollo argues that the true

parent is "he who mounts. Because the Furies fail
to ask what happens when the woman is on top,

they lose the case. In evaluations, a 
student wrote: "Daniel would be a better teacher

if he wasn't such an asshole. Weren't such an
asshole, I wanted to tell her, though as her

comments were supposed to be anonymous, I 
could not admit that I recognized her

handwriting. On a first date, I innocently
went to the bathroom when the check arrived. She thought

I was trying to stick her with the bill but when
she realized I was unaware of dating

etiquette she was charmed.  We had a nice kiss
goodnight, but afterwards I was so flustered I
went to a bar by myself, drank whiskey, and smoked
my first cigarette in years.


II.
                       Throughout my life I have always wanted to tell the truth,
                       even though I knew it was all a lie. In the end all that matters
                       is the truth content of a lie.
                                                     --Thomas Bernhard, Gathering Evidence

Before I met Lisa in person, says Jerry,
a user of an online dating service, I
really enjoyed the wit and flirtatiousness of
her emails. But on our first date she was stiff as
a board. I wasn't attracted to her, though I
slept with her anyway, just in case I might like it.
And I did. I liked it so much, that now we're
getting married.

I love you, she said, as she smacked her child's head.

I love you for your holes, she said,
not just the holes in your shoes and socks, but the
gaping holes in your personality.

When she asked me if I was uncomfortable,
I told her I wasn't.
I really was uncomfortable.
What I neglected to say
was that I enjoy being uncomfortable.

Two old friends meet in a caf to discuss
mutual funds and stock options. Thus begins a 
story that ends with one man slicing off the
other's neck, and stuffing his mouth with love poems
to Young Werther.

Life is too short to be genuine,
he said, as he stared into her deep
brown eyes. It was the most genuine thing
he's said all day.






The Man in Question
 

They dropped the charges of homicide, filed new charges of
terrorism, dropped the charges of terrorism, filed
new charges of public nudity, dropped the charges of
public nudity, filed new charges of lewd and
lascivious behavior. A spokesman for the FBI
said they found him on the hood of an SUV in a part
of town known as the "Fruit Loop. His penis was in another
man's mouth and in the front seat were vials containing a rare
strand of bacteria known to cause blindness in rats. They
dropped the charges of public nudity and filed new
charged of sodomy. A spokesman for the police department
said they found him with his pants down and it appeared
that his penis was in another man's anus. But since they
could not prove to what degree his penis had penetrated
the other man's anus they dropped the charges of sodomy 
and filed new charges of assault and battery. A 
spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said 
that he assaulted a worker from the Department of
Public Health who used a Q-tip to extract from inside of
his urethra a rare strand of bacteria capable
of causing pneumonia in chickens. He was placed in 
solitary confinement and a spokesman for the 
Department of Corrections suggested that he was a 
serious threat to the community. They examined the
strand of bacteria found in his urethra but since they
did not properly store the bacteria in the 
appropriate container with the appropriate seals and
signatures they could not charge him with intent to commit crimes
against humanity. They dropped the charges of intent to 
commit crimes against humanity and filed new charges
of larceny. They said he had stolen the rare strand of
bacteria from his employer and that he had done so
with the deliberate and malicious intent to harm as
many civilians as possible. They tried to verify
for whom he had worked during the given time period but since 
they could not verify the name or location of his
employer they dropped the charges of larceny and filed new
charges of tax fraud. When they discovered he was privately
employed, they dropped the charges of tax fraud and filed new
charges of theft with an unregistered weapon. A 
grocery store in his neighborhood had recently been robbed
and the cashier said that the thief had carried the same model
of weapon that the man in question kept beneath his bed in
case of emergencies. They dropped the charges of theft with an 
unregistered weapon when they discovered the cashier was
partially blind and that the weapon the man in question kept
beneath his bed in case of emergencies had been
properly purchased and registered. When they found on his
bookshelves several works of fiction with blind characters,
including King Lear, Oedipus Rex, Endgame, and Blindness by
Jos Saramago, they accused him of conspiring
to use the rare strand of bacteria to blind not only
the grocer but the seven other blind residents of his
neighborhood, each of whom had had perfectly good eyesight
until he came to town. They asked him why he had so many
books about blindness, but he refused to answer the question.
They asked him why he had so many books about blindness and
when his attorney arrived the man in question said that he
did not know why he had so many books about blindness. They
asked his friends and family why he had so many books
about blindness. No one knew why he had so many books
about blindness and they accused him in the press of
anti-social behavior. When his neighbors testified that
the man in question enjoyed society as much as he
enjoyed a quiet night at home, they dropped the charges of
anti-social behavior. They dropped the charges of
anti-social behavior and filed new charges of
jaywalking. An undercover police officer filmed him
with a video camera as he illegally crossed
the street. At the advice of his attorney, he pleaded
guilty to the charges of jaywalking. He agreed to pay
the fine.






The Barbaric Writers
 

"This is my last communiqu from the planet of the monsters.                                                                  Roberto Bolao, Distant Star
When I watched the Barbaric Writers defecate on my
manuscript, I felt a great sense of relief, a great sense of
fraternity with these men who loved literature enough to
destroy it, and I recalled a poem I had once written, but
never had the confidence to publish, about a so-called
poet who shat himself into a toilet, only to float on his
back as torrential downpours of power filled the bowl and drowned
him. I have always know that constipation is essential to
poetry, though what I did not realize, until recently,
was that poetry itself is repulsive. Words on their own are
bad enough. But when placed alongside other words, when formed
into rhythmic lines and stanzas: no act of creation is more
hideous. In the salons, I have often watched, before my turn 
came on, our local poets reciting their verses. They speak
politely, and with grace, to an audience that sips wine and
chuckles at the words that flow not from their mouths, but from their
plugged-up behinds. What a holy mockery of literature!
Were the barbarians to see such a spectacle, no
theater walls could stand the shock of their laughter. No, poetry
is not what I want. Only defecation on poetry. For
after years of humiliation, I have finally learned that
to humanize our poems, we must shit on them. We must shit
freely, with arms raised, as detectives in blue sport coats examine
our feces for sustainability, all the while fighting
off other detectives in bluer sport coats who take our
poetic leakage to their laboratories to search for
parasitic demons, or diamonds, depending on the angle.
We smear what drips from our self-inflicted wounds onto our verses,
combining blood and ink into new poetic forms in which we
rub our faces, the better to smell our disgusting children with,
the better to drool on our disgusting children with; and once we
have bled and drooled and driveled, we declare our poems complete, the
better to wipe our asses with, before submitting them for
publication. We smear our typewriters with pus and semen, and
chastise any fool crass enough to declare himself a poet,
an offense punishable by confinement in a cage
surrounded by Barbaric Writers who expectorate between
the distinguished author's eyes, his hands tied behind his back to
prevent him from cleaning his face. For poetry is hard work! It
is hard to create such filthy, vile putrescence.






Sentence
 

Ain't nothing more beautiful than a French diplomat in an
Italian suit discussing the intimate ties between
poetry and constipation with a United States
Senator in a discount blazer from the Men's Wearhouse bought
especially for the occasion of proposing the
Anti-Chimera Act, a prime indicator that if children were
once the future, they are not the past, which is growing
hairier every moment, so as to keep us from
penetrating its insides, which we must nibble on as if
nibbling on donuts, by which I mean rubrics, glittering
rubrics in the dry heat of an empty test bank full of
raccoons with flexible snouts and long tails that
materialize in the shrubbery as thick-set stocky
fraternity brothers suicide bomb colleges full of free
thinking mavericks with tuning forks in their ears and rubber dicks
in their pockets, a veritable cure for loneliness and
its side effects, including the desire to fantasize
about mythological genitalia in the pants of
pundits who declare that to be alive is
fundamentally okay as long as poets test their
verses on guinea pigs before submitting them to us
humans as we exit the amalgamated marshland of
surplus value and enter an ordinary evening on
which ordinary people dream of lubricated condoms
for dogs, of mules who practice the pull-out method, of birth
control pills for cats, of floating trousers that haunt city squares
in search of red-walled boutiques where silk stockings and boot-cut
chinos fight for the attention of disembodied legs
while merchants masturbate, aroused by visions of painless
castration, aroused by hands without arms scribbling conjunctions
into dusty ceilings, aroused by hands without arms stirring
infinite bowls of soup, aroused by module-makers who
insist only on the metaphorical value of money
as represented in the hieroglyphics painted on the 
walls of financiers who accumulate capital through the
unjustified sexual behavior of adulterous
women who appear asymmetrically--legs over heads, hands
coming out of butts--in public ceremonies in which
syringes suck out erroneous feelings from their bodies
while suits and ties stuff bones and ears into decorative
bottles and jars.






[When from my counted days]
 

When from my counted days I think of 
times still owed to me by tyrant love,
and my temples anticipate a frost
beyond the tribulation of my years
I see love's counterfeit joys are a poison
reason sips from a glass raised
to those for whom hunger dare appear
in the guise of my honeyed daydream.
What potion of forgetting pleases
reason that by neglect of its duty
so toils against itself for satisfaction?
But my affliction seeks solace, measure
of the desire to be remedied and
the desire to overcome it love's remedy



Cuando imagino de mis breves das
los muchos que el tirano amor me debe
y en mi cabello anticipar la nieve,
ms que en los aos las tristezas mias,

veo que son sus falsas alegras
veneno que en cristal la razn bebe
por quien el apetito se le atreve
vestido de mis dulces fantasas.

Qu hierbas del olvido ha dado el gusto
a la razn, que sin hacer su oficio
quiere contra razn satisfacelle?

Mas consolarse qiere mi disgust,
que es el deseo del remedio indicio,
y el remedio de amor, querer vencelle.

[Lope de Vega, 1562--1635]






[When I stop to consider my calling]
 

When I stop to consider my calling, remark
the places a wayward temper impelled me
I've found in light of where I wandered lost
the most appalling evils could have befallen;
but when I disregard the journey it's hard to
even fathom I endured so much affliction; 
what's more, my days being spent, I feel I've
seen my wariness go with them. I'll come to 
my end, for I surrendered artless to someone
with the science to dispel and destroy me if
so inclined, else the know-how to want to;
for if, with this very hand I could slaughter
myself, why--not on my account but because
so suited--would my enemy do otherwise?



Cuando me paro a contemplar mi estado
y a ver los pasos por do me han trado,
hallo, segn por do anduve, perdido,
que la mayor mal pudiera haber llegado;

mas cuando del camino est olvidado,
a tanto mal no s por d he venido;
s que me acabo, y ms he yo sentido
ver acabar conmigo mi cuidado.

Yo acabar, que me entregu sin arte
a quien sabr perderme y acabarme
si quisiere, y an sabr querello;

que, pues mi voluntad puede matarme,
la suya, que no es tanto de mi parte,
pudiendo, qu har sino hacello?

[Garcilaso de la Vega, 1501?-1536]

Fishing on the Susquehanna in July
 

I have never been fishing on the Susquehanna
or on any river for that matter
to be perfectly honest.

Not in July or any month
have I had the pleasure--if it is a pleasure--
of fishing on the Susquehanna.

I am more likely to be found
in a quiet room like this one--
a painting of a woman on the wall,

a bowl of tangerines on the table--
trying to manufacture the sensation
of fishing on the Susquehanna.

There is little doubt
that others have been fishing
on the Susquehanna,

rowing upstream in a wooden boat,
sliding the oars under the water
then raising them to drip in the light.

But the nearest I have ever come to
fishing on the Susquehanna
was one afternoon in a museum in Philadelphia

when I balanced a little egg of time
in front of a painting
in which that river curled around a bend

under a blue cloud-ruffled sky,
dense trees along the banks,
and a fellow with a red bandanna

sitting in a small, green
flat-bottom boat
holding the thin whip of a pole.

That is something I am unlikely
ever to do, I remember
saying to myself and the person next to me.

Then I blinked and moved on
to other American scenes
of haystacks, water whitening over rocks,

even one of a brown hare
who seemed so wired with alertness
I imagined him springing right out of the frame.






The Forced Departure
 

I consider the woman's choice in liberating a red dress with pale-green sandals.
My penury depresses me into a staring contest with a melting ice cube.
A friend excited my husband with an invitation to pilot a boat with powerful thrusters.
My gift of chocolate in pink cellophane failed to make the blonde smile.
Consequently, I remind the party-goers that Trans World Airlines painted a new night with nebulae.

I could be happy in Alphabet City, buildings crumbling around my notepad.
I could be happy sipping iced tea while admiring the seamless face of a pool.
I could be happy gurgling back at an infant dribbling green saliva down his chin.
I could be happy downing Absolut gimlets (ice-cold, no ice) in a neighborhood bar with pool players providing the music, or a hotel whose walls are laminated with mahogany and where tuxedos prevail.
I could be happy with your hand on my waist as you try to identify the scent hollowing my throat.

An entire landscape in Antarctica disappears, evaporates until salt becomes the only debris.
There are keys to everything, even handcuffs.
You could have been happy, too.






II. Homunculus
 

HOMONCULUS: n., pl. li 2. a fully formed, miniature human body believed, according to some medical theories of the 16th and 17th centuries, to be contained in the spermatozoon                     -- The Random House Dictionary of the English Language
The political contributions of whatever he creates are coincidental
and, in any event, irrelevant. The musician may not be relying on
mathematical acoustics in his calculations. He may be performing
for auditoriums; thus, his physical realities change as he travels. Music
seems inevitable. Every question entails some notion of what is being asked.
The motley nature is not alien. Certain sounds guide the vulgar mind
to notions not anticipated by those creating the sounds. A bartender
concocts an Absolut Citroen gimlet, ice-cold but no ice, with one hand;
"with the other hand he gathers up gonorrhea. Most of what is imparted
is not verbal. Certain philosophers must be translated before their audiences
can respond. The mind is made visible through unconscious functions.

The academic is always searching for the plumber. He is faithful to innocence.
Order is space and space is order. Order is space and space is order.
After being disaffected with Impressionism, Renoir felt he had to learn to draw
and paint all over again. In Germany, an aesthetic movement became political
and was forced to renounce art without realizing a decision had been made.
A philosopher did not realize that the man who expelled poetry from
well-ordered republics used to tremble at the thought of doing so,
thereby creating through that very act a sublime poetry.






I Do
 

"I do not know English--from "I Do Not by Michael Palmer"Marunong akong mag-ingles (I do know English)--any 21st-century Filipino poet
I do know English.I do know English for I have something to say about this latest peace stirring between a crack that's split a sidewalk traversing a dusty border melting at noon beneath an impassive sun.I do know English and, therefore, when hungry, can ask for more than minimum wage, pointing repeatedly at my mouth and yours.Such a gesture can only mean what it means: I do not want to remain hungry and I am looking at your mouth.I do know English and still will not ask permission.I shall call you "Master with a lack of irony; lift my cotton blouse; cup my breasts to offer them to your eyes, your lips, your tongue; keen at the moon hiding at 11 a.m. to surface left tendon on my neck.

The Investment Banker
 

*Lime coats the thick sheaf of paper crossed by thin, parallel lines of a darker green. They approximate the rippling surface of a river pregnant with water and smoothly traveling towards an orb of sea salt. His pen is a black crow against a sunlit sky. Its ink is harsh, blotting paper, even with the neat economy of motion in how the ink is laid. For a moment, a golden spark glints from a cufflink struck by a sun ray. Meticulously, the ink travels from point to point, dipping, then rising, then dipping again until it is halted by one of the four walls of a square. The paper mottles. He lays the pen besides the projection of a likelihood as an ache begins between his shoulder blades. As he rolls his head in a circle, he considers the placement of a decimal point. Lastly, he considers the definition of a percentage to be the probability of error instead of the probability of an answer's relevance.*It seems a secretary with large hair is shuffling until he notices that it is only a tight skirt hampering her thighs. He begins to feel the papers stacked on a crudenza curling their edges to protest being ignored. A lock of hair falls in front of his eyeballs and he notices a white feather. He immediately comprehends how long it has been since scissors tip-toed about his scalp. Bereft, he looks at his desk and is astonished at how still his fingers lie atop a yellow pad--he would have sworn his fear would have left his empty palms quaking at how time is consistently ending.*He looks up to be surprised at midnight "a done deal. His hands seek release and he wipes them against the pin-striped wool encasing his thighs. A woman with a blurred face atop a blue silk shirt pops her head through the door. He knows she is speaking but his gaze cannot locate the source of the buzzing. He feels a fleeting thought of inebriated bees, how they might blunder with pollen gratuitously. His gaze falls to the circle of diamonds on her left, blue-veined wrist. He takes a chance and replies, "Yes. It is sufficient to make her go away so that all that remains across his threshold is the shadow of a door. He feels he must complete the job by shutting a door but he is so tired.*Was I ever a boy? he asks himself as he watches the Chairman hold hands with his tall wife. The wife smiles but it is clear she is dangling her legs over a pedestal. When he reaches them for an obligatory greeting, he realizes (without being surprised at the certainty of this thought) that she smells expensive. He hears her emerald earrings tinkle like wind chimes. His breath is the breeze against her pale, seamless skin. She smiles at him and he feels even smaller. His breath is the flutter of a Trochilidae's wings. When he next turns to the Chairman, he is buffeted by the Chairman's smug grin. *He tattoos his fingerprints on the most random of surfaces. It happens that way each morning when he must read six newspapers beside The Wall Street Journal. One is in Japanese. Another in German. He cannot recall the last time he was lucid. He cuts himself shaving whenever the mirror reminds him that his eyes are covered by red cracks. They remind him of bigger faultlines just waiting to widen. He knows he will fold into himself during the fall. He feels that avoidance should be under his control. But it is not happening and he is often immobilized by this failure.*I should fall in love, he thinks, as he reads a worn newspaper clipping. It has traveled throughout the firm and reached him at last. He flinches at the leers clinging to the message. His fingers feel wet though the clipping is dry. The clipping is about Alan "Swift Thiessen, the man who once sat in an office down the hall. Once, Swift was a tight muscle tightly sheathed in Italian suits with double-breasted blazers, a sartorial sun amidst the human commodities forging together a partnership. It was an eccentricity allowed by Swift's ability to bleed rain from desiccated clients. Once, Swift also played squash every day. Now, Swift is clad in rough cotton and measures each passing moment in a jail, staring at rust and bricks. The newspaper reports how Swift went too far with a young, blonde boy sheathed in leather with metal studs. Still, The Investment Banker suggests to himself that he fall in love. Despite Swift's ignominious end, he feels that Swift still bested him by having felt certain compulsions about which he can only remain curious.*At 4 a.m. he is not displeased to be alone walking the streets. At 4 a.m., he feels that the hour offers a certain excuse for his loneliness. Now, he is walking in the aftermath of an unseasonal rain so that the light is clean and the pavement shines from the wash of water. The tall buildings conspire to maintain sufficient lights to surround him like Christmas. He notices a white flower in a bud vase by a window he passes. It is unexpected but pleasing and he pauses to think, Hello! He knows he is imagining things but he senses the flower open its petals a tad wider. His nostrils flare at the inexplicable perfume of jasmine. He looks forward to winter when snow will cover the city. Even in a blizzard, the snow is constant. They never fail to cling softly to him as he walks in their midst. He feels, It is such a loving feeling.





Early Sunday Morning
 

I used to mock my father and his chums 
 for getting up early on Sunday morning 
 and drinking coffee at a local spot 
 but now I'm one of those chumps.

 No one cares about my old humiliations 
 but they go on dragging through my sleep 
 like a string of empty tin cans rattling 
 behind an abandoned car.

 It's like this: just when you think 
 you have forgotten that red-haired girl 
 who left you stranded in a parking lot 
 forty years ago, you wake up

 early enough to see her disappearing 
 around the corner of your dream 
 on someone else's motorcycle 
 roaring onto the highway at sunrise.

 And so now I'm sitting in a dimly lit 
 caf full of early morning risers 
 where the windows are covered with soot 
 and the coffee is warm and bitter.






The Consent
 

Late in November, on a single night
 Not even near to freezing, the ginkgo trees
 That stand along the walk drop all their leaves
 In one consent, and neither to rain nor to wind
 But as though to time alone: the golden and green
 Leaves litter the lawn today, that yesterday
 Had spread aloft their fluttering fans of light.
  
 What signal from the stars? What senses took it in?
 What in those wooden motives so decided
 To strike their leaves, to down their leaves,
 Rebellion or surrender? and if this 
 Can happen thus, what race shall be exempt?
 What use to learn the lessons taught by time.
 If a star at any time may tell us: Now.





Magnitudes
 

Earth's Wrath at our assaults is slow to come
 But relentless when it does. It has to do
 With catastrophic change, and with the limit
 At which one order more of Magnitude
 Will bring us to a qualitative change
 And disasters drastically different
 From those we daily have to know about. 
  
 As with the speed of light, where speed itself
 Becomes a limit and an absolute;
 As with the splitting of the atom
 And a little later of the nucleus;
 As with the millions rising into billions--
 The piker's kind in terms of money, yes,
 But a million2 in terms of time and space
 As the universe grew vast while the earth
 Our habitat diminished to the size
 Of a billiard ball, both relative
 To the cosmos and to the numbers of ourselves,
 The doubling numbers, the earth could accommodate.
  
 We stand now in the place and limit of time
 Where hardest knowledge is turning into dream,
 And nightmares still contained in sleeping dark
 Seem on the point of bringing into day
 The sweating panic that starts the sleeper up.
 One or another nightmare may come true,
 And what to do then? What in the world to do?





Kashmiri Song
 

Pale hands I loved beside the Shalimar,
   Where are you now? Who lies beneath your spell?
Whom do you lead on Rapture's roadway, far,
   Before you agonise them in farewell?
 
Oh, pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains,
   Holding the doors of Heaven and of Hell,
How the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins,
   Beneath your touch, until you waved farewell.
 
Pale hands, pink tipped, like Lotus buds that float
   On those cool waters where we used to dwell,
I would have rather felt you round my throat,
   Crushing out life, than waving me farewell!





The Present
 

The present that you gave me months ago
is still unopened by our bed,
sealed in its rich blue paper and bright bow.
I've even left the card unread
and kept the ribbon knotted tight.
Why needlessly unfold and bring to light
the elegant contrivances that hide
the costly secret waiting still inside?






The Angel with the Broken Wing
 

I am the Angel with the Broken Wing,
The one large statue in this quiet room.
The staff finds me too fierce, and so they shut
Faith's ardor in this air-conditioned tomb.

The docents praise my elegant design
Above the chatter of the gallery.
Perhaps I am a masterpiece of sorts--
The perfect emblem of futility.

Mendoza carved me for a country church.
(His name's forgotten now except by me.)
I stood beside a gilded altar where
The hopeless offered God their misery.

I heard their women whispering at my feet--
Prayers for the lost, the dying, and the dead.
Their candles stretched my shadow up the wall,
And I became the hunger that they fed.

I broke my left wing in the Revolution
(Even a saint can savor irony)
When troops were sent to vandalize the chapel.
They hit me once--almost apologetically.

For even the godless feel something in a church,
A twinge of hope, fear? Who knows what it is?
A trembling unaccounted by their laws,
An ancient memory they can't dismiss.

There are so many things I must tell God!
The howling of the dammed can't reach so high.
But I stand like a dead thing nailed to a perch,
A crippled saint against a painted sky.






Reunion
 

This is my past where no one knows me.
These are my friends whom I can't name--
Here in a field where no one chose me,
The faces older, the voices the same.

Why does this stranger rise to greet me?
What is the joke that makes him smile,
As he calls the children together to meet me,
Bringing them forward in single file?

I nod pretending to recognize them,
Not knowing exactly what I should say.
Why does my presence seem to surprise them?
Who is the woman who turns away?

Is this my home or an illusion?
The bread on the table smells achingly real.
Must I at last solve my confusion,
Or is confusion all I can feel?






Elegy
 

In memory D.K., Scrovegni Chapel, Padua

"Even Duccio can't match
Giotto's stage management of great tragedy:
Transgendered Professor Y. in leather miniskirt
paces before the screen, wood pointer
scraping saint faces, slapping 
hunched women of the Lamentation. 
Blue-gold tumult of the chapel walls. 
After-lunch lecture hall heat. 
You're in that class with me. We go on 
from there--not long. You do The Waste Land
in different voices--Come in under the shadow
of this red rock--Strom Thurmond, Aussie 
bartender, Cantonese. HURRY UP PLEASE 
ITS TIME. Twenty years later,
I get your news by Facebook update,
three hundred characters or less, 
waiting for the Scrovegni to open
in the windy square across from 
Donatello's horse and rider,
dust flecks foaming past fetlocks 
and stirrups. You're someone I slept with 
long ago, stopped, pitied, forgot. 
Some remember the Berlin Wall,
some remember Vietnam or the first Gulf War,
I don't remember you except standing
by my chair in the smelly bedroom,
blue sheets undone. You scrub at your head
wet from the shower, drop the towel
on the floor. You ice my earlobe, light a match
to sterilize the needle: Give me a small red new potato,
you say. Kev pierced my ear with a needle and potato.
We were drunk, maybe tripping. Mom was waiting
when I came in, 3am, and saw the blood...You jab.
No pain. A tearing through resistance, 
tissues numbly separating. You do your mom:
JesusMaryandJoseph! she screamed. Have mercy!






Econo Motel, Ocean City
 

Korean monster movie on the SyFy channel,
lurid Dora the Explorer blanket draped tentlike
over Baby's portacrib to shield us from unearned
innocence. The monster slings its carapace 
in reverse swan dive up the embankment, triple-jointed bug legs 
clattering, bathroom door ajar, exhaust roaring, 
both of us naked, monster chomps 
fast food stands, all that quilted aluminum, eats through streams
of running people, the promiscuously cheerful guilty American
scientist dies horribly. Grease-dusted ceiling fan 
paddles erratically, two spars missing. Sheets whirled 
to the polluted rug. I reach under the bed, fish out 
somebody else's crunched beer can, my forearm comes out 
dirty. Monster brachiates from bridge girders like a gibbon
looping round and around uneven bars, those are your fingers
in my tangles or my fingers, my head hangs
half off the king-size, monster takes tiny child actor
to its bone stash. Pillow's wet. The warped ceiling mirror 
makes us look like fat porno dwarfs
in centripetal silver nitrate ripples. My glasses on the side table 
tipped onto scratchproof lenses, earpieces sticking up 
like arms out of disaster rubble. Your feet hooked over my feet. What miasma
lays gold dander down on forms of temporary
survivors wandering the promenade? You pull Dora
back over us--Baby's dead to the world--intrude 
your propagandistic intimacy jokes, 
unforgiving. "What, in a motel room? I say.
Purple clouds roll back to reveal Armageddon
a dream in bad digital unreality. Explosions repeat patterns like 
fake flames dance on fake fireplace logs. Sad Armageddon
of marriage: how pretty much nice 
we meant to be, and couldn't make a difference.






Dont Tell Me
 

it's iron, the bottle 
crouched on its white pedestal,
long beak spout and wide open handle
you could see starry sky through.

Everybody was doing that new stitch,
it had spread far west, oh yes,
said Mrs. ______ at Knit & Purl,
but how many hats can one person wear?

I'd like to be more useful--say
apprentice to a bung fitter, or make
chipped ice, to hit something (not live)
on the head, directly,

I've not yet seen the Rock Wren
though I saw a photo of one inserting
pebbles in the airflow pipe of a mine,
therein to lay its eggs. 






From "Odi Barbare
 

                               xxiv 
What is far hence led to the den of making:
Moves unlike wildfire | not so simple-happy
Ploughman hammers ploughshare his durum dentem
             Digging the Georgics

Vision loads landscape | lauds Idoto Mater
Bearing up sacrally so graced with bodies
Voids the challenge how far from Igboland great-
             Stallioned Argos

Vehemencies minus the ripe arraignment
Clapper this art taken to heart the fiction
What are those harsh cryings astrew the marshes
             Weep not to hear them

Accolades Muses' dithyrambics far-fraught
Borrowed labour ashen with sullen harrow
Cruel past that | Sidney and vesperal Tom
             Campion courted

Put to claim not otherwise vowed the era
What else here goes | I am no Igbo wit well
Versed in Virgil Pindar Euripides child-
             Hallowed Idoto

Revelation blessed in its unforthcoming
Closed with tempus aedificandi tempus
Destruendi bringing discharge of measure
             Blasting the home-straight



                               xxv


Lovelace there come difficult times between us
Though in your place I cannot well imagine
Why I should not follow her chequered steps in-
             Out of the sunlight

Candlelight here given the invocation
Starlit even | whatever else is silence
Gratiana somewhere still | she is dancing
             Dancingand singing

Singing not her heart out beyond the fable
Grand carotid arteries self-fulfilling
How the blood's tempered in its modulation
             Balanced impulsive

So are our storms trackered from solemn orbit
Turbulence granted our sequestered sphere now
Buffetted now spun on an awl now baffled
             Wreathed in cloud-garlands

Masques do so challenge and compose to labour
Hers the masque-like venture the scenes mechanic
Stars have held being since creation's fourth day
             Turned to their music

Noble her frame troubling the fame we yield her
All rites well done short of a consummation
Treading down nothingness to ever-dealing
             Maker unmonstrant



                               xxvi


odz I've been there done that the vanished children
Klezmer makes glad music at Lazarus gate
If as straggling voices the dead return now
             They have our number

Breathing hard we wrestled asbestos brake-pads
Luminously radioactive watches
Fizzled green plaque riding elastic wrist-bands
             Glue smelt of peardrops

Someone those taut days was predicting biros
Not my blubbered Jewish pal bright a bully
That we knew klezmer I much doubt the Wedding
             Dance for the Old Men

Time released me from him as I could not have
Many then had foresight but I was not one
Vital spinners counting there's no subtraction
             Ever can oust them

Odds are for pittance where redemption strands us
Debts of those long-dead sparks of phantom brain cells:
Who's to dance broyges tants the dance of anger's
             Conciliation?

There is no known voice but a clarinet sounds
Almost human touting a melt to die for
Hurl of things fastbound the last-known survivors'
             Wailed diminution



                               xxvii


Breathe on my nesh eyes as upon a glass | this
Something so exquisite I scarce can bear it
I do not think I ever could have borne it
             If not for real

Make estrangement all our desires that age so
Perfect empowerment the imperfection
How indemnify a degraded legend
             Lost to computing

Contumacious that I am and that now like
Poggio I | too much enjoy invective--
This for our good--so what you saw me turned on
             Mind if I stress this

Breathe on my nesh eyes I am tired of sleeping
Largo ma non troppo affettuoso
Well becomes fierce Didone trionfante
             Lyric oblation

As fantastic here as in those odd films we
Watched albeit singly The Tales of Hoffmann
What we must be not to be worked with mirrors
             Hives of perspective

Could I have found you in a film by Ophls
Silent resonances of glass configured
Had I but struck us off The Masque of Blackness
             As it was playing






Station
 

Days you are sick, we get dressed slow, 
find our hats, and ride the train.
We pass a junkyard and the bay,
then a dark tunnel, then a dark tunnel.

You lose your hat. I find it. The train
sighs open at Burlingame,
past dark tons of scrap and water.
I carry you down the black steps.

Burlingame is the size of joy:
a race past bakeries, gold rings
in open black cases. I don't care
who sees my crooked smile

or what erases it, past the bakery,
when you tire. We ride the blades again
beside the crooked bay. You smile.
I hold you like a hole holds light. 

We wear our hats and ride the knives.
They cannot fix you. They try and try.
Tunnel! Into the dark open we go.
Days you are sick, we get dressed slow.







Hawk
 

The forest is the only place
where green is green and blue is blue.
Walking the forest I have seen
most everything. I've seen a you
with yellow eyes and busted wing.
And deep in the forest, no one knew.






Spin
 

I've a friend in possession of
a philosophic spin;
if should I speak of art,
theology, 
the universe,
or whim, 

he thinks I speak of him.

This enduring tic, indicative
of universal spins,
theology, art
and whim,
nonetheless
makes

conversation grim.





Who
 

It was the blind girl from the rez who
stole the baker's missing bread;
it was the guitar playing fool who crooned
and raced the wild mustangs through our heads.
It was the village idiot who played
his chess without the fool, the bowl
of soup who said too late, too late, too late
to blame the thread, the spoon, the text, the mole. 

Beside the waterfall of fallen things
just east of town, it was the bearded man
attaching fallen things to angel's wings
while singing legends to the long, long grass.

It was the moon who laughed and laughed.
It was the moon who laughed herself in half.






Identification
 

It's good you came--she says. 
You heard a plane crashed on Thursday? 
Well so they came to see me 
about it. 
The story is he was on the passenger list. 
So what, he might have changed his mind. 
They gave me some pills so I wouldn't fall apart. 
Then they showed me I don't know who. 
All black, burned except one hand. 
A scrap of shirt, a watch, a wedding ring. 
I got furious, that can't be him. 
He wouldn't do that to me, look like that.
The stores are bursting with those shirts. 
The watch is just a regular old watch. 
And our names on that ring, 
they're only the most ordinary names. 
It's good you came. Sit here beside me. 
He really was supposed to get back Thursday. 
But we've got so many Thursdays left this year. 
I'll put the kettle on for tea.
I'll wash my hair, then what, 
try to wake up from all this. 
It's good you came, since it was cold there, 
and him just in some rubber sleeping bag, 
him, I mean, you know, that unlucky man. 
I'll put the Thursday on, wash the tea, 
since our names are completely ordinary--






Dreams
 

Despite the geologists' knowledge and craft, 
mocking magnets, graphs, and maps-- 
in a split second the dream 
piles before us mountains as stony 
as real life. 

And since mountains, then valleys, plains 
with perfect infrastructures. 
Without engineers, contractors, workers, 
bulldozers, diggers, or supplies-- 
raging highways, instant bridges, 
thickly populated pop-up cities. 

Without directors, megaphones, and cameramen-- 
crowds knowing exactly when to frighten us 
and when to vanish. 

Without architects deft in their craft, 
without carpenters, bricklayers, concrete pourers--
on the path a sudden house just like a toy, 
and in it vast halls that echo with our steps 
and walls constructed out of solid air. 

Not just the scale, it's also the precision--
a specific watch, an entire fly, 
on the table a cloth with cross-stitched flowers, 
a bitten apple with teeth marks. 

And we--unlike circus acrobats, 
conjurers, wizards, and hypnotists-- 
can fly unfledged, 
we light dark tunnels with our eyes, 
we wax eloquent in unknown tongues, 
talking not with just anyone, but with the dead. 

And as a bonus, despite our own freedom, 
the choices of our heart, our tastes, 
we're swept away 
by amorous yearnings for--
and the alarm clock rings. 

So what can they tell us, the writers of dream books,
the scholars of oneiric signs and omens, 
the doctors with couches for analyses-- 
if anything fits, 
it's accidental, 
and for one reason only, 
that in our dreamings, 
in their shadowings and gleamings, 
in their multiplings, inconceivablings, 
in their haphazardings and widescatterings 
at times even a clear-cut meaning 
may slip through.






The Owl
 

The flight attendants
go
from kore to semaphore

as a city falls into
discredited ether--

Gewick, gewick, oo-oo!

Shoulderless
stoic, take--from hands wisely
gloved--

a bony treat
through the hardware
in your face;

shrug your throat.
